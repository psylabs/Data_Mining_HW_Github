              PRESIDENT PLAYING POLITICS WITH HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the President is playing 
politics with the American people's health care.
  According to an editorial published in The Wall Street Journal:

       The White House seems to regard laws as mere suggestions, 
     including the laws it helped to write. On the heels of last 
     week's 1-year suspension of the Affordable Care Act's 
     employer mandate to offer insurance to workers, the 
     administration is now waiving a new batch of its own 
     ObamaCare prescriptions. These disclosures arrived inside a 
     606-page catchall final rule that the Health and Human 
     Services Department published on Friday, July 5--a classic 
     Friday news dump, with extra credit for the holiday weekend. 
     HHS now says it will no longer attempt to verify individual 
     eligibility for insurance subsidies and instead will rely on 
     self-reporting, with minimal efforts to verify if the 
     information consumers provide is accurate.

  House Republicans have warned for years of the failure of ObamaCare--
that it is too unworkable, too overreaching, and too destructive for 
American families. House Republicans have voted 37 times to repeal or 
to defund ObamaCare. The American people deserve a health care system 
based on the doctor-patient relationship, not on one mandated by a 
government.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
