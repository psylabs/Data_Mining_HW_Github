    MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3474, H.R. 3979, AND S. 2148

  Mr. REID. I am told there are three bills at the desk and I ask for 
their first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the 
first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2148) to provide for the extension of certain 
     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.
       A bill (H.R. 3474) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to allow employers to exempt employees with health 
     coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans Administration from 
     being taken into account for purposes of the employer mandate 
     under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

       A bill (H.R. 3979) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not 
     taken into account as employees under the shared 
     responsibility requirements contained in the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act.

  Mr. REID. Have all three titles been read, Madam President?
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have.
  Mr. REID. I now ask for a second reading of each of the bills but 
object to my own request, en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will 
receive their second reading on the next legislative day.
