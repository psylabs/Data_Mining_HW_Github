                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 177

  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the desk, 
and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 177) to repeal the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
     Reconciliation Act of 2010 entirely.

  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I now ask for a second reading and, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule 
XIV, I object to my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will 
receive its second reading on the next legislative day.
