 MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME EN BLOC--S. 1315, S. 1316, AND H.R. 1911

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I understand that there are three 
bills at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The clerk will read 
the titles of the bills en bloc.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1315) to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury 
     from enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
     and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
       A bill (S. 1316) to repeal the provisions of the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act providing for the 
     Independent Payment Advisory Board.
       A bill (H.R. 1911) to amend the Higher Education Act of 
     1965 to establish interest rates for new loans made on or 
     after July 1, 2013, to direct the Secretary of Education to 
     convene the Advisory Committee on Improving Postsecondary 
     Education Data to conduct a study on improvements to 
     postsecondary education transparency at the Federal level, 
     and for other purposes.

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I now ask for a second reading en bloc, and I object 
to my own request en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will be 
read for a second time on the next legislative day.
