                        AMERICAN WOMEN'S HEALTH

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, this week marks the second anniversary of the 
Affordable Care Act, legislation that makes quality health care more 
affordable for everyone. March is also Women's History Month, so I 
would like to talk about how this act affects women's health.
  Instead of just imposing government mandates on health care for 
women, I believe the Affordable Care Act empowers women and their 
families because the Affordable Care Act bans insurance companies from 
requiring women to obtain authorization before getting OB/GYN care. The 
Affordable Care Act keeps insurance companies from denying coverage for 
conditions such as breast or cervical cancer, pregnancy, having had a 
C-section, or being the victim of domestic violence; and it ends the 
practice of gender rating, so women will no longer be charged higher 
rates for simply being a woman.

  The Affordable Care Act does all of this while preserving Americans' 
right to choose their own doctor and the health coverage that they 
want. Women's health, Americans' health is better because of the 
Affordable Care Act.
