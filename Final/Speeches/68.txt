                  BENEFITS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, western New York has long distinguished 
itself as a leader in innovation and cutting-edge medical research. 
Buffalo gave the world cancer research when the New York Cancer 
Laboratory was first established by Dr. Roswell Park in 1897. Today, 
the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus continues to grow and thrive with 
the expansion of Roswell Park, plans for the University of Buffalo 
Medical School, and construction of a new women and children's 
hospital.
  I'm pleased to say that today western New Yorkers continue to receive 
good news about the availability and accessibility of health care. 
Yesterday, The New York Times reported that New York State health 
insurance purchased through the State exchanges will reduce insurance 
rates by at least 50 percent. Additionally, thanks to the Affordable 
Care Act, 37,000 kids with preexisting conditions will not be denied 
coverage because by law they can't be denied coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, health care should be affordable and accessible to all 
Americans. The progress we have already seen is promising, and we must 
keep moving forward.
