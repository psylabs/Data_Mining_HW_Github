                      EQUAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my 
colleagues in speaking up about women's health. As we approach the 
anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, I want to remind 
all of us about some of the challenges that women have faced before 
health reform was signed into law.
  Before health reform was signed into law, insurance companies could 
deny coverage to women due to so-called preexisting conditions like 
cancer or even simply having been pregnant. Insurance companies could 
force women to pay more for their coverage simply because of their 
gender. And now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women will be able 
to see their OB/GYN without a referral. You've heard that repeatedly 
today because that's critical and important to women. Women will have 
access to critical preventive services like birth control with no out-
of-pocket costs. And that ultimately saves health care expenses.
  Already, hundreds of men and women from all across San Diego have 
shared with me how important affordable access to contraception is for 
them and for their families. They can't afford to have it stripped away 
by this Congress.
  I urge my colleagues to build on these reforms to ensure that all 
women have equal access to health care.
