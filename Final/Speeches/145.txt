                   AFFORDABLE CARE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Madam Speaker, we need to amend a fundamentally unfair 
provision within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better 
known as ObamaCare. That is, many of the very people who have been 
responsible for writing, advocating for, passing, signing into law, and 
promulgating rules governing the implementation of ObamaCare are exempt 
from the coverage requirements mandated by this law.
  That is why I am introducing the Affordable Care Accountability Act. 
This legislation will require the President, the Vice President, all of 
the Cabinet Secretaries, all political appointees, all Members of 
Congress, and all congressional staff, including those from committees 
and leadership, to receive their health care insurance coverage through 
the insurance exchanges required under ObamaCare.
  Americans deserve to know that their government officials will never 
seek to pass legislation only to exempt themselves from all of its 
provisions.
