         H.R. 3962--THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA ACT

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose Speaker Pelosi's 
government takeover of health care.
  This bill, which weighs in at nearly 2,000 pages and at more than 20 
pounds, will raise taxes on individuals and small businesses, cut 
health care for seniors, raise health care premiums, ration care, and 
give Federal bureaucrats more power over decisions that should be made 
by our constituents and by their doctors. The bill raises taxes by $730 
billion, and it costs nearly $1.3 trillion. We literally cannot afford 
this government takeover of health care. There is a better way.
  We should, instead, be lowering health care costs by enacting medical 
liability reform, strengthening association health plans, allowing the 
purchase of health insurance across State lines, and eliminating waste, 
fraud, and abuse in Federal health care programs.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose Speaker Pelosi's health 
care bill.
