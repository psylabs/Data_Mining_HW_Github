 CMS CHIEF ACTUARY'S ANALYSIS ON EFFECTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND 
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. WALDEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House told the National 
Association of Counties a while back that Congress needed to pass the 
health care bill so we could find out what's in it. Well, we are 
finding out now.
  The Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
is the independent scorekeeper of legislation like this. Their report 
that they just issued said half of all seniors in America who are on 
Medicare Advantage plans, half, are going to lose that coverage under 
the bill that was signed into law.
  Well, that's a big problem for seniors in Oregon. Oregon has had one 
of the highest penetration rates in the United States of seniors who 
wanted Medicare Advantage and signed up for it. I was out in Ontario, 
Oregon, not long ago, and the seniors there raised their hands and 
said, ``Why are they taking away the Medicare Advantage I have?'' We 
now know under this independent evaluation half of them will lose that 
care, 38,000 seniors in my district alone.
  We need to repeal and replace this law that was jammed through this 
Congress, Mr. Speaker.
