                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. HORSFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, it is past time for this Congress to 
work together to improve the Affordable Care Act. This law can be 
improved, but it is also helping people throughout this country and in 
my home State of Nevada.
  One example that I would like to share with you today is that of 
Michelle, a constituent from Pahrump, Nevada. Michelle enrolled in a 
plan on the exchange that will save her $200 per month and allow her 
access to OB-GYN services closer to home. She called her enrollment in 
the program an overwhelmingly positive experience.
  Michelle is currently on a HIPAA-guaranteed plan that costs her $565 
a month. If she gets sick and needs an urgent visit, mammogram or other 
OB-GYN services, she has to drive to Las Vegas from Pahrump.
  After enrolling in the Affordable Care Act, she will save more than 
$200 a month and have access to local urgent visit and OB-GYN services 
in Pahrump.
  Madam Speaker, now is not the time to turn back the clock or leave 
constituents like Michelle behind. If Republicans are successful in 
defunding or even delaying the Affordable Care Act, Michelle will lack 
insurance. She will have to go back to the predatory plan that offered 
her no real coverage and costs even more.
  I ask my colleagues on the other side, let's work together to make 
the Affordable Care Act work for the American people.
