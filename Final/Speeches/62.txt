                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues have highlighted the 
challenges of implementing the Affordable Care Act at the Federal 
level. While these must be addressed, I would like to take a minute to 
highlight the successes we have seen at the State level in Rhode 
Island. Although a majority of States opted not to operate an exchange 
of their own, Rhode Island chose to be a leader in creating a State-
driven, integrated marketplace to provide quality, affordable health 
insurance for its citizens.
  On October 1, Health Source RI, the Ocean State's online portal and 
health insurance marketplace, opened for business. It has successfully 
enrolled over 5,000 residents to date without many of the issues 
plaguing the Federal Web site. Of course, we are still at the beginning 
stages of this process, and efforts are under way to improve and expand 
the successful rollout with many of our State partners.
  This has been a highly collaborative effort, and I look forward to 
continuing our work together so that individuals, families, and small 
businesses can shop for insurance that meets their needs based on 
transparent, competitive pricing and robust coverage.
