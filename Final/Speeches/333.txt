                    DO NOT REPEAL HEALTH CARE REFORM

  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, there will be no repeal of the health 
care reform law, so let's be clear. The agenda that the Republican 
leadership has set for this week's floor activity and the committee 
work that follows is nothing more than an opportunity to bad talk and 
fuel the misinformation about the Affordable Care Act which is a good 
law that will help over 30 million people be healthier, create millions 
of jobs, make our country more productive and stronger, and reduce the 
deficit.
  So I am urging all of my colleagues, but especially those on the 
other side of the aisle, in the name of collegiality and honesty with 
the public we serve, to drop the charade and let us use the time the 
people of this country have hired us for to work together to create 
more jobs and make sure the health care law is implemented properly, to 
save the homes of families, and to create an educational system that 
will once again make our children the first in the world.
