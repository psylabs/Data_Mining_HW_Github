  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The clerk will read the bills by

     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes;
       A bill (H.R. 3474) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to allow employers to exempt employees with health 
     coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans Administration from 
     being taken into account for purposes of the employer mandate 
     under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;
       A bill (H.R. 3979) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of
