  MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1513, S. 1514, H.R. 2009, AND H.R. 
                                  2775

  Mr. KING. Madam President, I understand that there are four bills at 
the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the 
first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1513) to amend the Helium Act to complete the 
     privatization of the Federal helium reserve in a competitive 
     market fashion that ensures stability in the helium markets 
     while protecting the interests of American taxpayers, and for 
     other purposes.
       A bill (S. 1514) to save coal jobs, and for other purposes.
       A bill (H.R. 2009) to prohibit the Secretary of the 
     Treasury from enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
     of 2010.
       A bill (H.R. 2775) to condition the provision of premium 
     and cost-sharing subsidies under the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act upon a certification that a program to 
     verify household income and other qualifications for such 
     subsidies is operational, and for other purposes.

  Mr. KING. Madam President, I now ask for a second reading en bloc, 
and I object to my own request en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will be 
read for the second time on the next legislative day.
