                              HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration last week announced 
that it would delay until 2015 the employer health mandate, a crucial 
provision of its signature health care law. This is of questionable 
legality.
  Days after that announced delay, the White House said that it would 
roll back requirements for new State online insurance marketplaces to 
verify the income and health coverage status of people who apply for 
subsidized coverage.
  And this week it was reported that the Obama administration has 
quietly notified insurers that a computer system glitch will limit 
penalties that the law says companies may charge smokers.
  These disclosures underscore the fact that ObamaCare is unaffordable, 
unworkable, and isn't what the American people were promised. It is 
time for President Obama to work with House Republicans to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act and replace it with effective, commonsense reforms 
that actually lower health care costs for working families and small 
businesses while protecting jobs and our economy.
