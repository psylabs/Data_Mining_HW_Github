                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, even with the difficulties of the health care 
Web site, we are seeing great things coming out of this Affordable Care 
Act. Across the country, millions of people who lacked affordable 
health care options yesterday are checking out their new options today. 
This law is working.
  I continue to hear scores of success stories from California. 
Marilynn, who is a breast cancer survivor, was paying nearly $1,300 a 
month for her Anthem Blue Cross policy. Through Covered California, she 
is saving now more than $500 a month.
  Although the healthcare.gov Web site has had its problems--that we 
are fixing--know that the California exchange has become a model for 
the rest of the country. Early enrollment results demonstrate that 
Covered California is working and people are signing up. We led the 
Nation in our readiness for this new law, and newly released numbers 
show that 131,000 Californians have already enrolled in new quality 
health plans on Covered California, more than any other State exchange.
  Rather than rooting for its failure, let's work together to make this 
a reality for all Americans.
