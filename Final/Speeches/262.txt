  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, many of my Republican colleagues are still 
obsessed with ending health care for the American citizen.
  I come here today to tell you the administration, experts, and my 
colleagues in Congress are working on making sure that all Americans 
have insurance.
  I say to you while they talk about ``glitch, glitch, glitches,'' yes, 
we are all disappointed with that. When they talk about the face of the 
stories, let me tell you that last week during our week at home, I held 
a tele-townhall conference, and many of my constituents called in and 
asked questions about the Affordable Care Act. Do you know why? Because 
they had a college student who can stay on their insurance. Do you know 
why? Because there were women who had pre-existing conditions now that 
can be covered. Do you know why? They were seniors. They were mothers. 
They were parents. That is what the Affordable Care Act is about.
  So I say to you to listen closely, America, because the Affordable 
Care Act will make a difference, and that is what we should have in 
this wonderful America that we live in.
