once said, ``Facts are stubborn

things; and whatever may be our wishes . . . or the dictates of our 
passions, they cannot alter the state of facts.''
  Well, Mr. Speaker, the facts are that the health care reform law is 
working for millions of young adults all across this country. 
Yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services released figures 
which show that 2.5 million young Americans up to age 26 are now 
covered because of the Affordable Care Act's provision that allows age 
26 coverage for families. Private and public employers all across 
America now provide this benefit at a cost of only, on average, 1 
percent to health care costs. This is a plan which is working.
  Last week, figures came out that showed that 2.7 million seniors are 
now getting relief from prescription drug costs--$1.5 billion in 
reduced prescriptions drug costs because the Affordable Care Act is 
closing the doughnut hole.
  Facts are stubborn things, and the facts show that the health care 
reform law is helping young Americans and older Americans.
