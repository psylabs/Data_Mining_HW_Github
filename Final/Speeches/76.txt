            VOTE ``NO'' ON REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the reckless 
attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The new law has already put in place critical protections to help our 
families across this country. I want to tell the story of one family in 
my district whose life has been dramatically helped by this law, the 
Strong family of Santa Barbara.
  Bill and Victoria Strong's daughter, Gwendolyn, was diagnosed at age 
6 months with a rare disease, muscular spinal atrophy. Her care is 
extremely expensive; and before the new law, the Strongs lived in 
constant fear that Gwendolyn would reach her policy's lifetime limit, 
no longer be covered for treatments and be uninsurable because of her 
pre-existing condition.
  The elimination of lifetime caps has given the Strongs peace of mind. 
They are guaranteed Gwendolyn will receive the care she needs and their 
family is protected from bankruptcy.
  Repealing these safeguards will take that security away. It would put 
this courageous little girl at risk of having her health care cut off 
when she needs it most and it would put this inspiring family at risk 
of bankruptcy.
  I urge my colleagues to stand for all those who are benefiting from 
the law, as the Strong family is. Vote ``no'' on repealing the 
Affordable Care Act.
