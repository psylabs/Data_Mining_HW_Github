                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS UNAFFORDABLE

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, some are trying to create the 
impression that the only problem with ObamaCare is the Web site, and 
the experts will soon fix that. Actually, the biggest problem with the 
so-called Affordable Care Act is that it is unaffordable.
  We are already having trouble paying for all of the Federal medical 
programs we have now. The cost of all of our Federal medical programs 
have been greatly underestimated at the start.
  Now with many millions more losing their coverage than the 
administration predicted, added to the millions previously uninsured, 
the cost of ObamaCare is already estimated at possibly four times more 
than when it was passed, and it is not even fully in place.
  Since it took 3\1/2\ years to even get a screwed-up Web site 
partially ready, most people don't believe the Federal Government can 
run our health care system efficiently in the first place. More 
bureaucratic, less-humane medical care, and all at much greater cost to 
taxpayers at both the Federal and State levels.
  This plan is a mess that will ultimately lead to shortages, waiting 
periods, and a great decline in the quality of American medical care.
