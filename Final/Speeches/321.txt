                    RELIEF FROM THE HEALTH CARE LAW

  (Ms. JENKINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JENKINS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commend this Chamber for 
passing three pieces of legislation this week that will offer Americans 
relief from the President's health care law.
  These bills, which passed with bipartisan support, reaffirm America's 
commitment to the ideals of religious freedom, volunteerism, and 
military service. Unfortunately, the President's health care law has 
put all three of these in jeopardy.
  As written, the law would force Americans with a conscientious 
religious objection to buy health insurance and count volunteer 
firefighters, other emergency responders, Active military members, and 
our Nation's veterans toward the employer mandate tax thresholds.
  I am a proud cosponsor of three of these bills because they all will 
ensure the Affordable Care Act does not discriminate against Americans 
on the basis of religion or sacrifice.
