House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in continued support of 
the Affordable Care Act and the promise of high quality, affordable 
health care for all.

passes. It is just a means to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, and I 
will not be in support of it.
  There are over 100,000 people who have now been able to obtain 
insurance under the Affordable Care Act. It is working. We need to work 
to improve it. I stand ready to do so.
