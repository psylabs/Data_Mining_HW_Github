            RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, tomorrow the United States Supreme Court 
is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care 
Act.
  Let us all step back and recognize those portions that people like. 
These are the highlights: For seniors, it closes the infamous doughnut 
hole for prescription drugs. This means, to date, about 5.3 million 
seniors have experienced savings of $3.7 billion. That doughnut hole 
will close completely by the year 2020.
  For women, we no longer are going to suffer the discrimination 
against us. Ninety percent of the plans today charge more for women 
than they do for men for the same process. In 2014, this stops. Women 
can no longer be discriminated against for what they call preexisting 
conditions. Do you know what these preexisting conditions are? Breast 
cancer, C-section and childbirth, pregnancy, victims of domestic abuse.
  And there will be a ban on maximum coverage in your lifetime for 
medical care. You will no longer need to have a referral to go see an 
OB/GYN. Children will also benefit.
  Madam Speaker, let's all recognize the value of the Affordable Care 
Act.
