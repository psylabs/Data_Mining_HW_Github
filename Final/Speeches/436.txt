                       DO NOT TURN THE CLOCK BACK

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, it's been about 236 years since we 
declared independence, but it's only been 92 years since women could 
vote. We have fought for equality, fighting our way from being second-
class citizens. One such battle is the discrimination in health care.
  For so long, insurance companies have denied coverage for preexisting 
conditions like pregnancy, breast cancer, C-sections, and domestic 
abuse. Ninety percent of the best-selling plans charge women more. Some 
plans require women to even get a pre-authorization before they can 
seek OB GYN services.
  From 2014, that will not be the case because of the Affordable Care 
Act. But just a few months ago, efforts by Republicans were to block 
contraception. Now the attempts are to repeal the Affordable Care Act. 
This is the act that's been the great equalizer for women and children.
  Don't let them turn the clock back. We should not have to do another 
hundred years of battle for equality.
