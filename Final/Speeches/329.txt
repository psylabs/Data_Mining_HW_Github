                          HEALTH CARE VICTORY

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)

[[Page H4164]]

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for the American 
people. The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act 
reaffirms our Nation's commitment to make sure that all Americans have 
access to quality, affordable health care and health insurance. For the 
millions of Americans who have gone without health insurance; the 
seniors who have struggled due to inadequate coverage; the women, 
children, and young adults that have been denied coverage for 
preexisting conditions, the Court's ruling is not only a victory but a 
validation that they deserve to have the most basic of human needs 
met--and that is access to health care.
  The ACA addressed so many gaps in the American health care system, 
from closing the Medicare part D doughnut hole to stopping the practice 
of denying those with preexisting conditions insurance coverage to 
claiming womanhood as a preexisting health condition to allowing young 
adults to stay on their parents' coverage.
  This law has changed the way our country manages and delivers all 
phases of our health care system, and I'm proud to have been part of 
its creation, and prouder still today to learn that the Court's 
decision was to uphold its constitutionality.
