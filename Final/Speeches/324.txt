                 HEALTH CARE PROMISES HAVE BEEN BROKEN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to relay disturbing, but 
not surprising, news about the President's health care law, news that 
is coming back from my district in Pennsylvania.
  Countless neighbors of mine employed by Sesame Place--which is a 
division of SeaWorld Entertainment--have been told that their hours 
will be cut back, presumably to comply with the crushing costs and 
regulations associated with the so-called Affordable Care Act. Adding 
insult to injury, they're being told that their health care is being 
terminated.
  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, President Obama made promises to the 
American people; and right now, those promises are not being kept. 
People were told that if they liked their plan that they could keep it. 
We were told that the health care law would not raise taxes, only to 
later see that 20 taxes are being used to fund this law.
  These promises have been broken, and my neighbors are seeing it. And 
they are seeing it up close, and they are seeing it personally. This 
law is hurting real people in my district and around the country. And 
it must be repealed, and it must be replaced.
