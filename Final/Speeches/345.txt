                           VOTE ON A CLEAN CR

  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, while Republicans are trying to 
destroy the Affordable Care Act, the American people are embracing it--
and have been for the past 3 years. Even my district, which is rightly 
upset over not being included in the exchanges like other Americans, 
has benefited.
  Let me tell you a story I heard from one of our doctors.
  According to one doctor, the preventive care without copays and 26-
year-olds being able to stay on their parents' insurance has helped 
keep her practice afloat. The up-to-35 percent tax credit for small 
businesses and the rebate from insurance companies that didn't meet 
their medical loss ratio allowed her to relieve her employees of their 
portion of the health insurance premiums. This, and many other ways, is 
how the Affordable Care Act is working in my community.
  Like a few other places in the law, fixes may be needed, like for the 
territories. The President and Democrats will address them, but in a 
rational manner.
  So I am calling on my Republican colleagues to end the hostage-taking 
of this Congress, of our Federal employees, of our economy, and the 
good faith and credit of our Nation. Don't fight us. Join us. Support 
the Affordable Care Act--a good law that is expanding access to 
affordable health care for all of us. When some of us benefit, all of 
us benefit.
  Let's vote on a clean CR, open up our government, and lift the debt 
ceiling today.
