                       SAVE AMERICAN WORKERS ACT

  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
Hoosier colleague, Representative Todd Young's excellent bill, the Save 
American Workers Act of 2014.
  We are a country built on hard work. We are a country where people 
want to work. But right now, the Affordable Care Act is stopping people 
from working the hours they need and the hours they want to work. By 
redefining a full-time employee as someone who works 30 or more hours a 
week, the Affordable Care Act has caused workers' hours to be reduced 
in vital industries across the Nation. 2.6 million workers are losing 
because of this provision. America is losing because of this provision.
  A school employee from my district in Elwood, Indiana, recently 
shared with me the pain losing 10 hours from her workweek has caused. 
She said:

       It just doesn't make sense to me. I'm trying to be a self-
     supporting person and was doing good. It could have been 
     better, but I was making it. How am I supposed to pay a house 
     payment, utilities, car insurance, let alone food?

  This is an unwise provision that must be repealed. That is why we 
must take action and restore the traditional 40-hour workweek. Let's 
pass the Save American Workers Act of 2014. If we do, our workers win, 
our employers win, and our Nation will win.
