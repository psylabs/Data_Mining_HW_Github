                      HEALTH CARE TO ALL AMERICANS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, they said it couldn't be done, but as 
of yesterday and early this morning, 7,000,041 individuals here in the 
United States accessed and enrolled in the Affordable Care Act.
  Is it working? Do people want health care? Yes, they do. Do they want 
access to the Affordable Care Act? Yes, they do. These numbers will 
probably grow when the State exchanges begin to report their various 
individuals that enrolled under their system.
  In the State of Texas, going all the way from last week until the 
lines around Reliant Stadium, to individuals staying until 10 o'clock 
at the Community of Faith Church, which I was at with Bishop James 
Dixon, to the Harris County Department of Education and 500 or 600 
there, yes, we want affordable care and the Affordable Care Act to give 
health care to all Americans.
  Now, we need to tell the States that you have left out millions of 
those who could benefit from the expanded Medicaid. I ask Governor 
Perry of the State of Texas to stop denying the millions of Texans who 
would be eligible under the expanded Medicaid to have health insurance. 
Stop denying them health insurance. This is a celebration. More will 
come, and it is good to know that the work that was done is benefiting 
Americans.
