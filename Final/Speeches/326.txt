     RESCUING AMERICANS FROM THE TRACKS OF HEALTH CARE DESTRUCTION

  (Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you why 
people would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It has become 
very, very clear that no matter how well-intentioned it may have been, 
it will not work. Time after time, we are finding that the things that 
they told us just aren't panning out to be true; and Senator Max 
Baucus, one of the law's main architects, recently described ObamaCare 
as a huge train wreck coming down.
  We have a chance to save Americans from being casualties of the train 
wreck. We can yank them off the tracks. Today, I voted to show that I 
am trying to do just that.
  I call on the United States Senate and the Senators to join us in 
rescuing the American people from the tracks of health care 
destruction.
