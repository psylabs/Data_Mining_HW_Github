             GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, when we needed 
bipartisan action to lower costs and improve health care, Congress 
passed the Affordable Care Act on a party-line vote.
  Given the growing number of failures that have been revealed since 
the law's implementation began, it is time for Congress to work 
together to address the unworkable provisions for the good of the 
American people.
  Fortunately, opposition to the ACA's flawed policy is moving beyond 
party labels. Last year, the Democratic-led Senate voted 79-20 to 
repeal the law's medical device tax. Since then, more and more Members 
of Congress recognize there are bigger problems.
  Earlier in January, despite the Obama administration's vocal 
opposition to the efforts to boost consumer protections under the law, 
a veto-proof majority of Republicans and Democrats in the House voted 
to pass H.R. 3811, which would help secure personal information on the 
online exchanges.
  Madam Speaker, the American people deserve bipartisan solutions.
