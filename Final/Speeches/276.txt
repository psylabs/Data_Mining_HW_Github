  REPUBLICANS CONTINUE ASSAULT ON THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT ON 1-
                            YEAR ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the 1-year anniversary of the 
passage of the Affordable Health Care Act to voice my disappointment 
with my Republican colleagues' continued assault on the historic law 
that has already begun to provide aid and relief for countless 
Americans.
  One year ago, my colleagues and I came together to enact a law 
because of the call to action from our constituents. We heard from 
seniors who could not afford their prescriptions and were in the 
Medicaid doughnut hole, parents whose children were being denied 
coverage due to preexisting conditions, individuals who were being 
denied treatment due to lifetime limits, and taxpayers who are bearing 
the costs of uncompensated health care.
  We answered the clarion call from our constituents who asked us to 
protect them. Yet the Republican colleagues continue to assault the 
law. Siding the special interests, particularly the health care 
insurance companies that stand to lose from health care reform, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to assault our 
program.
  With that, I say let's keep the law in force and let's move forward 
with progress.
