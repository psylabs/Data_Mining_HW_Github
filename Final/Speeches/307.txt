      HEALTH REFORM AND THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA ACT

  (Ms. BERKLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I can't stand here today and tell you that 
this legislation will solve every health care problem we face as a 
Nation, but I can tell you this. There's 460,000 Nevadans that have no 
health insurance at all. In my district alone, this bill will provide 
coverage for 163,000 of my fellow Nevadans.
  It's not just the uninsured that will benefit. In Las Vegas, more 
than 200,000 households will receive credits to make insurance more 
affordable and over 16,000 small businesses will be provided with a tax 
credit to make it easier for them to provide coverage to their 
employees.
  The bill improves coverage for seniors by closing the doughnut hole, 
eliminating copays for preventive services, and extending the solvency 
of the Medicare program for another 5 years. It eliminates preexisting 
conditions as a reason to deny coverage. It lifts the lifetime limits. 
I have 10-year-old children who are juvenile diabetics in my office 
that have already exceeded their lifetime caps. This bill eliminates 
that.
  The current health care system is unsustainable.
