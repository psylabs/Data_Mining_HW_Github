                               OBAMACARE

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, when the time comes, Members and staff will 
get their insurance at dchealthlink.com. They will have a good chance 
to pay less because they will have 267 choices.
  In advance, one of my staff members, who has a name-brand policy from 
our Federal program, went on dchealthlink
.com and found that she could get a comparable policy for at least $100 
less with no deductible.
  If Republicans want to deal in anecdotes, hers is far more typical 
than those from the crowd who have gone from 41 repeals to their new 
strategy of actively sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.
