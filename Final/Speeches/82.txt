             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I rise today because this is a great 
country. In fact, I would call it the greatest country in the world.
  Throughout my life's history, although we have traveled mountains and 
low valleys, I have been equal and unequal in this Nation. Yet today I 
feel as tall as the pine trees because our Supreme Court shed itself of 
diverse and sometimes divisive bickering and upheld the Constitution of 
the United States.
  It granted to the American people affordable health care. It granted 
to the sickest of the sick the opportunity to be covered by insurance. 
It granted to seniors who fall into doughnut holes and who have to 
choose prescription drugs over food a relief line. It granted to 
hospitals that take in indigent patients who may otherwise die on 
sidewalks in America an opportunity to take care of those patients. It 
gave children with preexisting diseases an opportunity to live fully in 
this country.
  So now the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. We have been 
vindicated. Every single, single vote of those Members who have lost 
and of those who have won, we've been vindicated. Thank God for the 
United States Supreme Court.
