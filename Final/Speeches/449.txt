  Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of repealing the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  It's no secret that the U.S. health care system is broken; however, 
instead of strengthening the system, the Affordable Care Act took a 
top-down approach that will leave patients and taxpayers worse off than 
they were before.
  I believe Americans should have access to effective and affordable 
care. This can best be accomplished by using market forces to improve 
quality and control cost.
  I support allowing individuals to purchase health insurance across 
state lines and the expansion of associated health plans, health 
savings accounts, and other free-market reforms that allow individuals 
to be in control of their own healthcare decisions.
  Americans have a choice when they buy a car or go to the grocery 
store. Why can't they have that same choice when purchasing something 
as important as health care?
  I also support allowing small employers and individuals to pool 
together to purchase health insurance, thereby giving them greater 
buying power to negotiate when purchasing a plan.
  Expanding health savings accounts not only gives individuals maximum 
flexibility in determining how to spend their health care dollars, but 
it encourages saving and helps reduce the overall cost of health care.
  Finally, I support reforming the tax code so individuals get the same 
incentives that employers currently have for purchasing health care.
  These measures will make health care more affordable, and unlike the 
law we are repealing today, they are sustainable.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
