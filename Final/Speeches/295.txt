                               speech of

                           HON. JACKIE SPEIER

                             of california

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, tonight as we prepare to pass a historic 
health care bill that provides expanded health care coverage to 
Americans and is more than sixty years in the making, I am concerned 
that we must first fight to block a direct assault on a woman's right 
to choose.
  America's Affordable Health Choices Act is fair and equitable in its 
approach to abortion and respects the rights of those who want to 
purchase a plan that provides abortion coverage and those who do not. 
It guarantees that no public funds are used to pay for abortion 
services--codifying the long standing Hyde amendment.
  The anti-choice Stupak Amendment seeks to take away a woman's right 
to pay for her own abortion services, forcing millions of women to 
retreat to the shadows and an era in which back alley abortions were 
too often the norm. That is why I will stand up this evening and vote 
against the Stupak Amendment--ensuring that every woman in this country 
has the reproductive freedom that she desires and that her mother and 
mother's mother fought so hard for.

                          ____________________
