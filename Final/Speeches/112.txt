                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I received an 
email from a woman who runs a small business in my district. I will 
read it to you now:

       Morgan, As you know, I'm a small business with 36 
     employees, have been paying 75 percent of my employees' 
     health care for over 20 years.
       Get a call from health care provider agent that although my 
     renewal date is March 1, the companies are offering to renew 
     on December 1 this year with a 9.8 percent increase. This is 
     to beat what is anticipated as a 30 to 60 percent increase 
     after all the effects of ObamaCare.
       Needless to say, this has reignited my frustration with the 
     so-called Affordable Health Care Act. Please stick to your 
     principles, continue the fight. Let me know what, if 
     anything, I can do.

  Yes, ma'am, I will.
