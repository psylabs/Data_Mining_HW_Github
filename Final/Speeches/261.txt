                     BREAST CANCER MORBIDITY RATES

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday in Memphis at 10 o'clock, I will 
be holding the first of a series of health forums on issues of 
importance to the people of the Ninth District. The one on Thursday 
will be on the racial difference in breast cancer morbidity. A New York 
Times story told of a study which showed that African American women 
have a greater likelihood than Caucasian women of dying from breast 
cancer in Memphis than any other city. We will have a panel to discuss 
it and try to find ways to have people get mammograms, change their 
diets, and see their physicians.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, you don't have to pay a copay or a 
deductible to get preventative care. The Affordable Care Act could 
reverse that morbidity difference in Memphis. People need to get their 
mammograms.
  People can go to community health centers that have been funded 
through the Affordable Care Act to get mammograms, watch their diet, 
and reverse this horrible trend. I encourage people to come to the 
Church Health Center on Union at 10 o'clock Thursday morning in Memphis 
to learn about this problem.
