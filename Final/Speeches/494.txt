                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1292

  Mr. REID. I am told that there is a bill at the desk due for its 
first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1292) to prohibit the funding of the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act.

  Mr. REID. I ask for a second reading, and in order to place the bill 
on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my own 
request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be 
read for a second time on the next legislative day.
