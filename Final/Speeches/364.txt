            By Mr. PRICE of Georgia:
        H.R. 1990.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Consistent with the original understanding of the commerce 
     clause, the authority to enact this legislation is found in 
     Clause 3 of Section 8, Article I of the Constitution. The 
     bill stops the IRS implementation of the Patient Protection 
     and Affordable Care Act, which exceeds the authority vested 
     in Congress by the Constitution. Finally, the bill removes 
     government intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship, 
     which is protected by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the 
     Constitution.
