      THE FATE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AWAITS THE SUPREME COURT

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, here we are, 32 hours away from the Supreme 
Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act. No one has a clear idea of 
what their decision will be. We've worked hard in preparing for any 
decision that might come from the Supreme Court,

and their announcement will certainly be watched by all.
  As the chairman of the Congressional Health Caucus, I've held a 
series of policy forums to discuss the future of health care in this 
country. Today we heard from Dr. John Goodman, president and CEO of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas. Dr. Goodman has put a 
considerable amount of time into how to craft health care policy that 
will be beneficial to all Americans without the burdensome law that we 
currently have.
  Additionally, doctors in Dallas convened with four Members of 
Congress earlier this month. They produced a set of principles that I 
will provide for the Record. I encourage people to spend some time and 
look at those, and understand that we have to have health care in this 
country that's patient-centered, doctor-led, and most of all, we keep 
the government out of the way.
