                MOVING FORWARD ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act began delivering 
important benefits and protections to millions of American families and 
small businesses almost immediately after it was signed into law 3 
years ago.
  Just yesterday, we learned that the cost of health plans in New York 
are set to drop 50 percent. And starting in 2014, California's small 
businesses will be able to access competitive, affordable, quality 
health plans on the Covered California Small Business Exchange, finally 
putting them on more equal footing with the rates that have been 
enjoyed by the big guys.
  And last week, I invited the Small Business Administration to come to 
my district and meet with my local small businesses. They walked them 
through key pieces of the law so they could understand the facts and be 
able to make good decisions about health insurance for their employees. 
Many were pleasantly surprised.
  We need to move forward on affordable health care for Americans, not 
backwards.
