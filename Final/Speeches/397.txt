            SECRETARY SEBELIUS CONTINUES TO VIOLATE CONGRESS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, last month, it was learned that the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, has been 
calling executives from private groups asking them to fund the 
Affordable Care Act by donating money to a private organization called 
Enroll America. Her actions then were questionable and have left us to 
wonder what the Secretary is promising executives in exchange for their 
support.
  Last Tuesday, Secretary Sebelius disclosed that she solicited three 
additional companies, all of which provide services regulated by her 
agency: a drug maker, Johnson & Johnson; a health care system, 
Ascension Health; and a health insurance provider, Kaiser Permanente.
  And so it begs the question: How far will this administration go to 
promote their flawed takeover of the country's health care?
  Agencies that have already been engrossed in scandal, like the IRS, 
will be directly administering major provisions of the Affordable Care 
Act. Along with them, the Department of Homeland Security, the 
Department of Labor, and the Treasury, these agencies will be involved 
in sharing and tracking consumer information to implement the 
President's law.
  Do you really want to entrust this administration with the 
responsibility of controlling your health care and controlling your 
health care information?
