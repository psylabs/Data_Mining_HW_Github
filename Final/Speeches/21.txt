                     THANK YOU, AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. BROWN of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, my fellow Americans, the results 
are in with the closing of the Affordable Care Act's first-time open 
enrollment period: over 7 million Americans have now secured quality, 
affordable health care coverage for themselves and their families.
  I want to congratulate everyone who signed up. I personally called 
over 30,000 people to encourage them to sign up, and worked at one of 
the sign-up sites over the weekend.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no American could ever again be 
denied coverage for a preexisting condition; no woman can ever again be 
charged a higher premium just because she is a woman; 3 million young 
Americans age 26 and under can stay on their family plan; no American 
ever again will have to worry that one major illness will bankrupt 
their family; no senior will ever have to pay a copayment for key 
preventative services such as cancer screening.
  I want to thank everyone for signing up and not going for the 
okeydoke.
