                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address 
what has really been going on behind the scenes in the Affordable Care 
Act. You see, if millions of people didn't lose their coverage, the 
architects of the law knew the exchanges would be full just of sick and 
elderly, without healthier populations subsidizing those plans.
  No matter which way you spin it, the President's broken promises--
this one, in particular--should concern us all. We were promised we 
could keep our policies, coverage, and doctors; yet these choices are 
now being denied for millions of Americans.
  Many of us are not surprised. For the fact of the matter is that the 
Affordable Care Act is not about consumer choice. It is about 
governmental control, control over our lives, control over our 
decisionmaking. This is social engineering at its worst.
  The lackluster performance of a Web site will disappear over time. 
Unfortunately, the insurance cancelations and cost increases are going 
to continue regardless of an executive order or another ``promise'' 
from the White House. The American people deserve better, Mr. Speaker; 
and they surely can't afford more broken promises.
