                          OBAMACARE EMPLOYMENT

  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, every week I hear from constituents who are 
being hurt by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The law is 
imposing new costs on businesses and workers, reducing take-home pay, 
reducing the number of jobs available, and reducing the number of hours 
employees are working.
  Survey after survey confirms that the anecdotes I hear from back home 
are true for Americans across the country. A survey of 300 accountants 
finds that employers are holding back on hiring workers and that some 
are even paring back their payrolls.
  CNBC reports that doctors are skeptical and confused about the 
implementation of the law. Workers, doctors, and employers have every 
right to be confused since the Affordable Care Act is being implemented 
haphazardly and without regard to the law as it is written. 
Beneficiaries will sign up for subsidies without income verification.
  We don't truly know what we'll get until October, but we can say with 
confidence that it won't be what the President promised years ago. 
Americans won't be saving $2,500 a year, many will lose the coverage 
they have, and others will have to switch to a new doctor.
  Many promises have already been broken, and more disappointment is 
bound to happen.
