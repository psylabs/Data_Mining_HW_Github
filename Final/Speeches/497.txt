                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 2575

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I understand that H.R. 2575 has been 
received from the House and is at the desk. I would ask for its first 
reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 2575) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to repeal the 30-hour threshold for classification as a 
     full-time employee for purposes of the employer mandate in 
     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and replace it 
     with 40 hours.

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I would ask for a second reading and 
object to my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection having been heard, the bill will 
receive its second reading on the next legislative day.

                          ____________________
