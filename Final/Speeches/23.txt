            AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STANDS ON A SAND FOUNDATION

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, even the White House's best ObamaCare damage 
control efforts, waivers, delays, penalty deadline, adjustments, and 
temporary fixes sadly leave the so-called Affordable Care Act's sand 
foundation untouched.
  Math undergirding the entire law remains structurally unsound and 
threatens the broader insurance market in this country. That is a shame 
for each and every American.
  As someone who wants to see greater access and affordability in 
health care, and more options for Americans in the individual insurance 
market, it is my hope that the country moves toward a competitive, 
patient-centered system like the one outlined by the House Republican 
Study Committee in the American Health Care Reform Act.
  Something as transformative as health care policy should never be 
forced on the American people on an embarrassingly unstudied and purely 
partisan basis, the way President Obama chose to proceed with the 
Affordable Care Act.
