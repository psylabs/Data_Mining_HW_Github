        HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I stood here 2 days ago addressing the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and reviewing its benefits. 
I stand here today after the landmark Supreme Court decision to make 
people aware of the Republicans' efforts to repeal this historic piece 
of legislation.
  The stakeholders must remember: seniors, the benefits with the 
prescription drugs already benefiting with $3.7 billion in savings; 
young adults who stay on their parents' plan until the age of 26, 6.6 
million of you; small businesses who will experience tax credits of up 
to 50 percent by the year 2014; and women, women who suffered 
discrimination in premiums and on preexisting conditions like 
pregnancy. Imagine being defined a preexisting condition. 2014 they 
will stop.
  These are just highlights, and this is why we need to, again, focus 
behind the Affordable Care Act and remember, it's the largest part of 
our GDP that keeps growing; and we need to have it under control in 
order to have our great economy.
