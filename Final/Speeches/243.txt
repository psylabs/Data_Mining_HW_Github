                SAVE AMERICAN WORKERS ACT LESSENS BURDEN

address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, businesses across the

country have stopped hiring, and millions of Americans are beginning to 
see less take-home pay as a result of the Affordable Care Act's 30-hour 
workweek requirement.
  That is the crux of the problem with the Affordable Care Act, Madam 
Speaker. The law's burdensome employer requirements dissuade businesses 
from expanding and encourage shifting current workers from full to 
part-time work.
  Congress should be advancing policies to expand employment 
opportunities, especially during tough economic times, rather than 
undercutting the ability of Americans to earn more.
  This is the reason that the House today passed H.R. 2575, the Save 
American Workers Act, legislation that will allow businesses the 
opportunity to expand workers' hours by redefining full-time employees 
under the Affordable Care Act and reverting back to the traditional 40-
hour workweek definition.
  The Save American Workers Act will lessen the burden being imposed on 
employers and help to increase wages so that Americans, especially 
those with limited means, can better provide for their families.
