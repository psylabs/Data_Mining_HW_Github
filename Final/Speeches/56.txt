            HIDDEN TAXES INCLUDED IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, you wouldn't know it by the weather, but it 
will soon be April, and tax day is right around the corner. As 
Americans scramble to gather their W-2s and other important tax 
documents, many are unaware of the extra hidden taxes included in the 
Affordable Care Act that will ultimately fall on them.
  These hidden taxes will surprise and catch hardworking families and 
small businesses off guard and put a strain on family budgets that are 
already stretched thin.
  A 3.5 percent tax on insurance premiums, a 2.3 percent medical device 
tax--raising the cost of pacemakers, prosthetics, stents, and more--a 
tanning tax, an investment income and Medicare payroll surtax, the list 
goes on and on; and all these costs are passed on to Americans and 
families in our communities.
  That is hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars leaving our 
communities, out of the pockets of hardworking families in States like 
Kansas and heading to Washington, D.C.
  Mr. Speaker, with the many challenges Americans face today, the last 
thing they need this tax season is to carry a heavier government tax 
burden on their backs.
