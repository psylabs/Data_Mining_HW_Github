                          HON. EARL BLUMENAUER

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, passage of the Affordable Health Care 
for America Act marks the most important single step in 100 years in 
addressing the health care needs of American families. For the first 
time, the U.S. government has dealt comprehensively with the entire 
health care system.
  Tonight I voted for every Oregonian who has faced bankruptcy when 
they've lost their care or has been denied coverage because of a pre-
existing condition. Tonight, I voted to protect every Oregonian who has 
health insurance but sees their costs rising every year.

  I'm pleased we were successful in the incorporation of major reforms, 
improving care for all Americans while strengthening the position of 
Oregon medical care providers.
  This critical milestone, while historic, signals more hard work ahead 
to get the bill to the President's desk. I will work to strengthen the 
reforms while fighting to lower costs to make health care more 
affordable for families and the federal treasury.
  We must then be prepared to keep working to implement this sweeping 
change. But tonight we should all pause to celebrate this moment in 
history.
