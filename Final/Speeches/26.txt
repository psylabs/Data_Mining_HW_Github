                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA Mr. Speaker, again, on the front of the Affordable Care 
Act we have yet another business--this one in northern California, in 
Paradise, California--called California Vocations.
  This is a nonprofit group that helps people with developmental 
disabilities to find employment. This organization has had to drop for 
90 employees its health care coverage because it cannot afford it under 
the Affordable Care Act.
  This week, we will be taking up legislation to give people the 
opportunity, if they like their health insurance, to be able to keep 
it, as was promised by the President. We need to move on this measure 
in order to help the President to keep the promise that he said or 
implied, but more importantly, the promise to the American people that 
they have choice, that they have freedom in this country to make their 
own decisions, not have the heavyhanded government deciding for them 
something that doesn't work or they cannot afford.
