               THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S IMPACT ON WOMEN

  (Ms. FUDGE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, the National Women's Law Center recently 
reported that 90 percent of the best selling health plans charge women 
more than men for the same coverage. In addition, insurers have 
classified millions of women as having preexisting conditions because 
of a previous cesarean section or having been pregnant, even for being 
a victim of domestic violence.
  For decades, women have unfairly been charged excessive costs for 
their health care. Well, that changes now. Because of the Affordable 
Care Act, the discriminatory practice known as ``gender rating,'' or 
charging women more than men for care, will be prohibited starting in 
2014; and women in private plans can obtain free lifesaving procedures, 
such as mammograms and colonoscopies.
  The Affordable Care Act bans insurance companies from imposing 
lifetime limits on care, so Americans will not go bankrupt simply 
because they are trying to be healthy.
  And in 2014, because of health care reform, women cannot be denied 
access because of a preexisting condition.
  There is no better time than today to stand up and demand quality, 
accessible health care for women.
