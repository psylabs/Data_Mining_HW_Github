                         HEALTH CARE AND PPACA

  (Mr. SALMON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my continued 
concerns with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It seems 
that every day we learn a new way this law is negatively impacting the 
American middle class.
  Last week, three prominent unions sent a letter to the Senate 
majority leader and the House minority leader. In the letter, union 
leaders highlighted how ObamaCare is driving up the cost of small group 
insurance plans, causing employers to drop employees from their 
coverage or convert the employees to part-time status.
  In fact, that's exactly what happened in my district in Mesa, 
Arizona. The Maricopa Community College District

announced that it will be cutting hours for adjunct faculty and 
student-service workers in order to convert them to part-time status 
and avoid onerous ObamaCare requirements and mandates. This is not only 
a financial hardship for these professors and their families, but the 
students suffer as well.
  Higher costs under ObamaCare are forcing employers to choose between 
keeping their doors open or cutting hours and staffing levels. These 
are the unintended consequences of a very, very bad law.
  It's time to repeal this law before it inflicts more harm on middle 
class America. We must take all necessary steps to repeal and replace 
this tragic legislation with true health care reform that relies on 
commonsense free-market policies and returns the power to patients and 
their doctors, not Washington bureaucrats.
