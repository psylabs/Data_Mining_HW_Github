                         DON'T REPEAL OBAMACARE

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, 3 years after the Affordable Care Act was 
signed into law, a law that is already helping millions of Americans, 
our friends on the other side of the aisle are wasting time again on a 
pointless symbolic vote that will never become law and takes us 
backwards.
  For the 37th time, our colleagues are forcing us to vote on repealing 
the Affordable Care Act when they know--they know--it has no chance of 
succeeding.
  For the 37th time, they are voting to allow insurance companies to 
deny coverage to children with preexisting conditions.
  For the 37th time, they are voting to roll back our efforts to not 
allow insurance companies to charge women more just because they are 
women.
  And for the 37th time, they are voting to strip small businesses of 
protections against the skyrocketing insurance premiums we faced long 
before the ACA.
  Einstein used to say: Insanity is when one attempts to do the same 
thing over and over again--expecting a different result.
  This is wrong for the 37th time and a waste of our time.
