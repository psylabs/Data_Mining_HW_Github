             REPEALING THE JOB-KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. JOHN B. LARSON

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 19, 2011

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to add one more 
story to this debate to help illustrate why the Affordable Care Act is 
so important. One of my constituents recently wrote to tell me that his 
19 year old son has a rare liver disease and that his only hope is a 
transplant. Under the new healthcare reform law, he is now able to keep 
his son on his insurance plan to age 26. His household would be out of 
luck without healthcare reform as last year his son's health care costs 
exceeded $120,000.
  It is stories like these that are the essence of why passing health 
reform was so important. It provides protections to ensure that someone 
like my constituent can access health care and not face exorbitant 
personal costs when an illness strikes.
  I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this repeal legislation and 
hope we can all work together to find ways to move our country forward.
