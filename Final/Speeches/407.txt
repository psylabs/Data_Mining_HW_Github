  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, all we are asking is the President keeps his 
word. I have got hundreds of letters now from constituents from all 
across my entire district.
  Nate from Oakdale says:

       Before the Affordable Care Act, our health coverage was 
     $279 a month for me and my wife. We recently got a letter in 
     the mail stating that our plan is no longer available due to 
     the Affordable Care Act and that our premium will be $434.60 
     a month, an increase of $155.60.

  Tom from Ceres says:

       Farm Bureau has informed me that my med insurance will be 
     canceled in January 2014. My premium will increase 170 
     percent for now.

  Valerie from Denair:

       My policy was canceled. In shopping for a new plan, I see 
     that my monthly cost will at least triple for inferior 
     coverage.

  These lists go on and on and on.
  Dawn from Turlock says:

       I just received a letter today from my health care 
     provider, and they have notified us our health care insurance 
     has just doubled.

  We owe it to the American people that this does not go on any longer. 
The President needs to fulfill his promise.
