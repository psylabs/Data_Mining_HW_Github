                           ACA IMPLEMENTATION

  (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, despite my significant frustration with the 
rollout of the Affordable Care Act, I remain committed to increasing 
access to affordable health care for every Granite Stater. To that end, 
I support efforts to ensure that folks who like their current health 
plan can keep them for another year.
  In New Hampshire, Granite Staters already have the option of renewing 
their current plans; and I believe that families across the country 
should be able to do the same, and I will support good-faith efforts to 
do that.
  But the Affordable Care Act is not a perfect law, and I am committed 
to improving it. Make no mistake; we cannot go back to the days when 
insurance companies were free to deny insurance coverage for people 
with preexisting conditions, or simply because they were female and 
their rates would be higher, or to drop people from their plans because 
they got sick, or to drop people from their plans because they grew 
older and were not living in their own home with the family.
  I will continue to work with anybody who is serious about making this 
law work and to ensure that Granite Staters have access to the quality, 
affordable health care that they deserve.
