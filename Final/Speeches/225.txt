     THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER TO RESULT IN LOSS OF JOBS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. We are 6 months and 6 days away from the full weight of 
the President's takeover of American health care. It's like a train 
that's careening down the tracks on a collision course with the 
American economy. Last week, Gallup released a survey of small business 
owners, and it's even worse than it looks:
  Almost half of small business owners reported that they have frozen 
hiring because of the Affordable Care Act. Another 20 percent said that 
they have already had to lay off workers because of this law. So that's 
one out of every five small businesses laying off people because of 
legislation the administration has forced on hardworking Americans. 
That's a staggering number of people who are going to have to suffer 
because of the administration's shortsighted policy.
  The President and his allies are under the faulty impression that 
educating people about the Affordable Care Act will suddenly make it 
popular and make it work. The truth is that people are already finding 
out far too much about this law as it costs them and their family 
members jobs. We have to continue highlighting the destructive parts of 
this law before it destroys an already weak economy.
