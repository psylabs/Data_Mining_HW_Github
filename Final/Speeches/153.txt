                         AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Payne) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, for millions of Americans, the dream of 
access to affordable health care is becoming a reality, thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act.
  In New Jersey, 2.2 million people have already gained access to free 
preventative care. Premiums will be 20 percent lower in 2014. Seniors 
on Medicare already received a 50 percent savings on prescription 
drugs, and more than 70,000 young adults in New Jersey are able to see 
a doctor because they can stay on their parents' insurance.
  Sadly, though, out of purely selfish political motivation, my 
Republican colleagues are obsessed with making this law fail and are 
working overtime to take away the benefits millions of people are 
already enjoying. I challenge my Republican colleagues to channel that 
same energy into making the law work so that millions can get the 
lifesaving care that they deserve.
  Look around your districts. How many of your constituents could 
benefit from access to lifesaving health care, to free cancer 
screenings and reduced prescription drug costs? They don't need a 47th, 
48th, or 49th vote to repeal the law. They need the affordable, quality 
care that the ACA provides. And they are counting on their leaders to 
make it work, not to work against them to make it fail.
