  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, last week the health insurance 
marketplace opened, giving millions access to quality health care. 
Since then, there has been too much focus on the small hiccups that are 
to be expected when any large program is implemented.
  Yesterday, I received a letter from a North Carolina woman who lives 
over 600 miles from my home district in Illinois. Like many 
Illinoisans, she believes the positives of the Affordable Care Act are 
being overlooked. She said:

       My family has already benefited from the Affordable Care 
     Act as I have two children just finishing college. I am 
     relieved I can keep them on my medical coverage at no cost. 
     This saves them money and gives me peace of mind. The cost of 
     our health care plan has decreased by $400.

  Like many, she wants to ask Congress: Is this why you shut down the 
government, to keep me and my children from getting affordable health 
care?
  Citizens are sick and tired of the misinformation being spread about 
the ACA. The ACA didn't cause the shutdown. The shutdown is a symptom 
of what really ails America--cynicism that allows a few to take hollow 
ideological stances at the expense of many.
  Like me, she wants us to pass a clean CR and end this shutdown today.
