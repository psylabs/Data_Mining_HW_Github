                             ROLLING ALONG

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is always good to have a number of 
good news stories for my colleagues and the American people, and I am 
delighted to have a good news story, which is that the Affordable Care 
Act is rolling along. I recognize that the most important aspect of 
this law is that Americans, like Kendall Brown in Oklahoma City, are 
having their lives changed in front of their eyes.
  She writes to the President that she has Crohn's disease and she has 
already benefited from the Affordable Care Act by being able to stay on 
her parents' insurance, but now she is able to enroll. And she wrote in 
this letter that as individuals are debating to delay the individual 
mandate--she said:

       Mr. President, if they do it, then this is the last letter 
     that you will receive from me because I will be dead by the 
     time I am 27 years old.

  So the good news is, my friends, enroll. You can use 1-800-318-2596--
30,000 calls and only 20 seconds in wait time. You can use the 
navigators. You can use the outreach efforts. You can even get on the 
Web and be educated. 1-800-318-2596.
