                    REPUBLICAN'S FEAR OF DR. BERWICK

  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow's a sad day. Don Berwick, Dr.

[[Page H8015]]

Berwick, will step down as Administrator of Medicare. It's a bad day 
for seniors.
  But the Senate Republicans are happy because they believe that 
getting rid of Don will end the implementation of the Affordable Care 
Act. When the Senate Republicans blocked a vote on Dr. Berwick, they 
made it possible only for a recess appointment for 18 months. Why do 
the Republicans fear Dr. Berwick so much? Hard to say.
  His career has been spent improving the quality of health care. He 
believes that we can have good quality health care at low cost. They're 
synonymous. He put patients first, believing in evidence-based 
medicine, and collaborates with others in the public good.
  His sin was that he once said a nice word about the British health 
care system, and therefore he has to go.
  Dr. Berwick's a great public servant, and the Republicans demonized 
him. Republicans have cynically prevented America's seniors from having 
the benefit of Dr. Berwick's vision and experience, and they ought to 
be ashamed of themselves.
  We will do the Affordable Care Act in spite of the fact that Dr. 
Berwick is gone.
