                               speech of

                        HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 24, 2010

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Preservation 
of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act.
  This important legislation will ensure that Medicare and TRICARE 
beneficiaries will be able to keep their doctors by retroactively 
reversing a 21 percent decrease in physician reimbursement that 
occurred on June 1, 2010. Additionally, this measure would provide 
physicians a 2.2 percent increase in physician reimbursements through 
November 30, 2010.
  While I am pleased that the House is considering a 6 month fix, I 
continue to support a permanent solution. It is not fair to medical 
providers to face the continued uncertainty of temporary fixes. I am 
proud that I supported and the House passed a permanent fix last 
November, and would urge my colleagues in both the House and Senate to 
recommit themselves to passing legislation to permanently fix this 
problem.
