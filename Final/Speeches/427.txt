    OBAMACARE WILL DESTROY THE VERY HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WORKERS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, here it is, Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, section 1513, page 159, paragraph D, Effective 
Date. This is the section that deals with the so-called ``employer 
responsibility,'' what we call the ``employer mandate,'' the effective 
date as defined in law:

       The amendments made by this section shall apply to the 
     months beginning after December 31, 2013.

  Mr. Speaker, I'd like to bring the House's attention to a letter that 
was submitted to Leader Pelosi and Leader Reid by leaders of some of 
our country's labor unions. This is from James Hoffa from the Teamsters 
Union.

       Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, we have been 
     bringing our deep concerns to the administration seeking 
     reasonable regulatory interpretations to the statute that 
     would help prevent the destruction of nonprofit health plans. 
     As you both know firsthand, our persuasive arguments have 
     been disregarded and met with a stone wall by the White House 
     and the pertinent agencies. This is especially stinging 
     because other stakeholders have repeatedly received 
     successful interpretations for their respective grievances. 
     Most disconcerting of course is last week's huge 
     accommodation for the employer community--extending the 
     statutorily mandated December 31, 2013, deadline for the 
     employer mandate and penalties.
