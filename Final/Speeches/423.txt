                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, this week, a Republican colleague spoke of 
the need to shut down the government. He said: ``We just want to help 
Americans get past one of the most insidious laws ever created by 
man.'' He was referring to the Affordable Care Act, but his words 
sounded eerily familiar to statements from this body's past.
  A Congressman once said:

       Never in the history of the world has any measure been 
     brought here so insidiously designed as to prevent business 
     recovery--to enslave workers.

  Another one said:

       We cannot stand idly by now as the Nation embarks on an 
     ill-conceived adventure in government medicine, from which 
     the patient will be the ultimate sufferer.

  These aren't quotes about the Affordable Care Act. The quotes are 
from Congressman Taber in 1935, opposing Social Security, and from 
Congressman Hall in 1965, opposing Medicare.
  What if opponents of Social Security and Medicare shut down the 
entire government because they didn't get their way? What if the 
majorities gave into the demands of those on the wrong side of history? 
This country would be very different today.
  These may be forgotten, but this reckless shutdown will not be, and 
the American people will remember who caused it.
