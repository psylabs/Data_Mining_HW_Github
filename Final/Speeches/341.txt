          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. CORNYN:
  S. 1315. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from 
enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health 
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; read the first time.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of 
the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

                                S. 1315

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the IRS Off Your Health 
     Care Act of 2013''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) On May 10, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service admitted 
     that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, 
     seeking tax-exempt status.
       (2) This action raises pertinent questions about the 
     agency's ability to implement and oversee the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and 
     the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 
     (Public Law 111-152).
       (3) This action could be an indication of future Internal 
     Revenue Service abuses in relation to the Patient Protection 
     and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
     Reconciliation Act of 2010, given that it is their 
     responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual 
     mandate.
       (4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, 
     and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the 
     Federal Government.

     SEC. 3. PROHIBITING ENFORCEMENT OF PPACA AND HCERA.

       The Secretary of the Treasury, or any delegate of the 
     Secretary, shall not implement or enforce any provisions of 
     or amendments made by the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act (Public Law 111-148) or the Health Care and 
     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152).
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. CORNYN:
  S. 1316. A bill to repeal the provisions of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act providing for the Independent Payment Advisory 
Board; read the first time.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of 
the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

                                S. 1316

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Seniors' Access 
     to Medicare Act of 2013''.

     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF THE INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD.

       Effective as of the enactment of the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), sections 3403 and 
     10320 of such Act (including the amendments made by such 
     sections) are repealed, and any provision of law amended by 
     such sections is hereby restored as if such sections had not 
     been enacted into law.

                          ____________________
