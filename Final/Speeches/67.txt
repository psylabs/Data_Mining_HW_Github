                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acquaint you and my 
colleagues with Mr. Butch Matthews, a 61-year-old former small 
businessman from Little Rock, Arkansas, who used to wake up every 
morning at 4 a.m. to deliver canned beverages to retailers before 
retiring in 2010.
  A lifelong Republican, he was heavily skeptical of the Affordable 
Care Act when it first passed. ``I did not think ObamaCare was going to 
be a good plan; I did not think it would help me at all'' is what he 
said. But after a little research, he has now found out that he can get 
a better plan than he already had and at the same time save $13,000 a 
year.
  When he was asked what would he say to people who are skeptical about 
the plan, Mr. Matthews says this: ``I would tell them to learn more 
about it before they start talking bad about it.''
  Mr. Speaker, he is still a real strong Republican, but he says: I'm 
very happy this came along.
