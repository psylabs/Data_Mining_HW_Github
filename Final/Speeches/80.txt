                    DON'T REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Madam Speaker, I think it's worthwhile to remember why 
Congress passed health care reform in the first place. It's because our 
system was broken; it wasn't working.
  But just this morning, Speaker Boehner said that we needed to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act because we didn't need it because we had the 
best health care system the world has ever seen. Well, I don't think 
that was true for 17 million children who were being denied health 
insurance for preexisting conditions. I don't think that was true for 
about 3.1 million young adults who were denied coverage because they 
were kicked off their parents' insurance plans. And I don't think that 
was true for 40 million Americans who couldn't get coverage and for 
every family threatened with losing their coverage because of rising 
costs.
  If we need to tweak the law, let's work together to fix it, but let's 
not repeal it. I think that would be bad for our health.
