             OPPOSING THE REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, instead of 
taking steps to create jobs and grow the economy, Republicans yesterday 
voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 37th time.
  The Affordable Care Act is working, and its benefits are being felt 
throughout the country, especially in my home State. Almost 525,000 New 
Mexicans now have access to free preventative services, such as 
mammograms, flu shots and colonoscopy screenings. Almost 19,000 seniors 
have benefited from lower prescription drug costs, and over 26,000 
young adults in New Mexico can stay on their parents' insurance plans 
until they are 26.
  So why in the world would we want to hurt seniors, women and young 
people by repealing the Affordable Care Act?
  Let's not forget that the Affordable Care Act is a job creator. The 
Medicaid expansion alone will create 6,000 to 8,000 jobs in New Mexico 
and will pump more than $5 billion into our economy over the next 6 
years.
  Mr. Speaker, let's stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and 
let's get back to work on behalf of the American people.
