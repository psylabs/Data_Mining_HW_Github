            HEALTH CARE AND COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, during this holiday season, it appears 
that all our fellow Americans are hearing is a sense of pessimism; but 
I rise to talk about the optimism of this Nation and the great strides 
that we have made, particularly as it relates to our seniors.
  The Affordable Care Act has taken the brunt of everybody's criticism. 
My friends on the other side of the aisle are singing a broken record, 
not a Christmas carol.
  It is important to note that seniors have benefited. The Affordable 
Care Act recognizes the financial burdens that seniors face. No group 
has been hit harder by soaring health care costs. But now, under the 
Affordable Care Act, seniors can have preventative care services 
without any copay, coinsurance, or deductible.
  Services like wellness visits, cholesterol testing, and others, sing 
a good song, yet we sing a negative song to those who are lining the 
streets for comprehensive immigration reform. The families who have 
been fasting have been suffering.
  Let's sing a good song for health care and do comprehensive 
immigration reform.
