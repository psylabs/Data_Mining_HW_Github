                      OBAMACARE IS NOT ABOUT CARE

  (Mr. RADEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RADEL. Certainty and stability are really all that our 
businessowners are asking for from us here in the government so that 
they can grow and create jobs. Instead, we handed them ObamaCare--a 
nightmare for people who own businesses or who are trying to start up 
their own businesses. Worse, it is a nightmare for you and your family. 
It's not fair for you, for your kids, for your grandkids. ObamaCare 
will and is cutting your wages, your hours--it may even cost you your 
job--and it is weakening our social safety net.
  In the big picture, ask yourself: When it comes to your health care, 
who knows how to care for you and your family most--you or some 
stranger here in Washington?
  ObamaCare is bad for business, putting 3 million American jobs in 
jeopardy--and that is not speculation, Secretary Sebelius. It's plain 
and simple. The Affordable Care Act is not affordable. It's not about 
your health; it's not about care--and it is not fair. It's not fair to 
our seniors, our kids, our grandkids, or to you.
