            IF YOU LIKE YOUR HEALTH PLAN, YOU CAN'T KEEP IT

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, ``If you like your health plan, you will be 
able to keep your health plan.''
  That is what the President said in 2009, but now NBC News is 
reporting that this administration knew for at least 3 years that that 
wasn't true.
  Now millions of hardworking Americans in the individual market will 
not be able to keep their plans even if they like them. People across 
the Nation are experiencing sticker shock as they receive cancelation 
letters from their insurers and see their monthly premiums rise up to 
400 percent. More people have received cancelation letters than have 
enrolled so far through all of the Affordable Care Act exchanges.
  The Affordable Care Act has proven to be anything but. It is time for 
the President and my Democratic colleagues to work with us to suspend 
this flawed law and to work to fix it. We have to find a better way to 
deliver the reforms people really need because this law isn't working.
