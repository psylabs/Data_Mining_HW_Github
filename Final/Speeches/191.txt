                          WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE

  (Ms. CASTOR of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Let's get to the facts on women's health care 
under the Affordable Care Act, which is 2 years old this week.
  First, good news: The Affordable Care Act outlaws discrimination 
based on gender in copayments and premiums for the same coverage. Women 
have generally been charged more for health insurance. A recent report 
shows that more than 90 percent of the best-selling health plans still 
charge women more than men for the same coverage. The Affordable Care 
Act ends that discrimination.
  Second: Women can no longer be denied coverage by an HMO or health 
insurance company because they have a preexisting condition like breast 
cancer that's in remission, because they had a C-section when they 
delivered their child, or even because they had injuries from domestic 
violence.
  Third: Women no longer have to jump through the bureaucratic hoop of 
obtaining permission to see their OB/GYN.
  Fourth: Because prevention works and saves money, women in new health 
insurance plans will automatically be covered for screenings, 
mammograms, colonoscopies, and birth control.
  Finally, health insurance companies can no longer cancel your policy 
if you get sick.
  These are important consumer protections for women across America, 
for our mothers, for our daughters, and for our families.
