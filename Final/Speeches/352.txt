                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                       HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 3, 2011

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1213) to 
     repeal mandatory funding provided to States in the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act to establish American 
     Health Benefit Exchanges:

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1213.
  This bill would eliminate funding for a key component of the 
Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion--the State-based health 
insurance Exchanges.
  The Exchanges are the chief vehicle through which we will give 
millions of individuals and small businesses--currently locked out of 
the market--access to affordable coverage.
  The Affordable Care Act provides each State with the flexibility to 
design its own Exchange--tailored to meet the needs of its residents, 
strengthen the private insurance market, and provide consumer 
protections.

  This bill repeals the funding for the Exchanges and eliminates that 
flexibility.
  Repeal would deny Illinois and every other State the funding needed 
to setup a unique State solution for improving and fixing broken 
insurance markets.
  This bill undermines the work already being done in Illinois and, 
given the State budget situation, will likely mean Illinois would be 
unable to run its own State-based health insurance Exchange.
  In September, Illinois received a $1 million grant to begin planning 
and establishing its Exchange.
  Without funding to move to implementation, we won't have the 
resources to get our Exchange up and running and millions of 
Illinoisans will lose access to affordable, adequate health insurance 
coverage.
