               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, 38 times? How many times will we vote to 
repeal or take away patient protection from families and to undermine 
the middle class? It makes no sense.
  Look at what we know:
  The United States Supreme Court said the PPACA is constitutional;
  Millions have already benefited;
  One hundred million cannot have lifetime limits placed upon their 
health care;
  By January 2014, 129 million cannot be denied coverage due to a 
preexisting condition;
  By 2020, there will be no doughnut hole, and already 6.3 million 
seniors save $6.1 billion on prescription drugs;
  Women cannot be discriminated against by 2014; last year alone, 90 
percent of the best-selling plans still charged women more; and
  Seventeen million children are now protected from being denied 
coverage due to a preexisting condition.
  Mr. Speaker, really, 38 times? Why? It makes no common sense.
