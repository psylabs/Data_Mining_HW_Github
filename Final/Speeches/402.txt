          FOUR YEARS AFTER OBAMACARE, AMERICANS ARE WORSE OFF

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, this is the Affordable Care Act. Yesterday 
marks the 4-year anniversary of when it was signed into law. We all 
knew, at least on the Republican side of this House, how this thing was 
troubled when it was passed 4 years ago, but what no one could have 
predicted was the aggressive incompetence of the administration and the 
agencies during the implementation.
  It is hurting average Americans. I get comments from people back home 
on my Facebook page literally every day. People tell me their stories 
of their health care plans being canceled, their premiums and 
deductibles going up, and trusted access to family doctors being lost.
  Rosie told me her premiums went up 62 percent last year. Heidi's 
husband lost his job because his company was forced to downsize because 
of the law. Kim told me her family's premium has gone up, resulting in 
over $9,000 a year now out-of-pocket, in addition to what they paid 
last year.
  One person put it best, saying: This Affordable Care Act is simply 
not affordable. Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve better.
