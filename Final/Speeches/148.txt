                       AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, as we hear from Members of 
this House every day, I thought it would be refreshing to bring the 
people's voice directly to this floor. So I asked my constituents to 
send me their thoughts that I could deliver as a 1-minute speech.
  The following is from Susan Sigmund of San Diego, who sent me this on 
the Affordable Care Act to be reviewed by the Supreme Court. She 
offered: ``Being given the opportunity to speak before you, I wanted to 
make these 60 seconds witty, timely, and relevant to all. Having failed 
at that, I will simply discuss my main concern right now. It's the 
future of the health care law. The Supreme Court could strike it down 
next year.
  ``I have a preexisting health condition and will die in about 3 years 
unless I am able to buy a health insurance policy. I'm sure I am one of 
many facing this bleak possibility.
  ``As I understand it, if the mandate section requiring a policy goes, 
so goes the provision barring preexisting condition discrimination. If 
the time comes, please do the honorable thing and vote to allow your 
constituents with preexisting conditions to buy health care insurance. 
Lives depend on it. Thank you.''
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mrs. Sigmund for bringing to the House 
her thoughts on health care.
