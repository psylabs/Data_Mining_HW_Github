                            JOBS, JOBS, JOBS

  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it's now been 866 days since I 
arrived in Congress, and the Republican leadership has still not 
allowed a single vote on serious legislation to address our 
unemployment crisis.
  That's zero votes to address our Nation's most pressing emergency. 
That's zero votes to address the sequester policies that are making our 
job crisis immeasurably worse. Yet yesterday, the Republican Congress 
took its 37th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Mr. Speaker, this was not only a colossal waste of valuable time that 
could have been spent focusing on jobs legislation, it's a further step 
in the wrong direction. By expanding access to health care, the 
Affordable Care Act gives Americans more disposable income, creating 
more customers for our businesses and, in turn, more jobs.
  It's time to bring the American Jobs Act to the floor. It deserves a 
vote.
  Investigate Benghazi; investigate the AP leaks; investigate the IRS; 
but, Mr. Speaker, don't forget our focus, our crisis. Our mantra should 
be: jobs, jobs, jobs.
