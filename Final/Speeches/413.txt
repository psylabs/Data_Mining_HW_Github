                        THE TEA PARTY IS WORRIED

  (Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, so the Tea Party has successfully shut 
down the operations of the Federal Government. And why have they done 
it? Well, they've done it because they're worried:
  They're worried about the danger that the Affordable Care Act is 
going to work and people are going to like it;
  They're worried about the danger that people with preexisting 
conditions are going to be covered;
  They're worried about the danger that women are going to qualify for 
preventative health care services;
  They're worried about the danger that children living at home up to 
age 26 are going to be covered under their parents' insurance policies;
  They're worried about the danger that seniors are going to save money 
on their prescription drugs as the Medicare part D doughnut hole 
closes.
  What they're worried about is that the Affordable Care Act is going 
to work and people are going to like it.
  Mr. Speaker, the Tea Party thinks these things are dangerous, so they 
shut down the government. But with all respect, I say to you, it is the 
Tea Party--it is the Tea Party, itself. They are the danger.
