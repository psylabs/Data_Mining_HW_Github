                     HELPING SICK AMERICANS NOW ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, despite blocked attempts 
to fully repeal the so-called Affordable Care Act, this law is doomed 
to collapse under the weight of its own flawed design. Just last week, 
Democratic Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a key architect of the 
Affordable Care Act, referred to the administration's signature health 
care law as a looming ``train wreck.'' Another promise that was used to 
force passage of the President's health law was broken in February, 
when the administration's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
announced that it would stop enrolling people with preexisting 
conditions due to funding constraints.
  This week, the House will vote on the Helping Sick Americans Now Act, 
which would extend access to those with preexisting conditions. The 
coverage would be funded by eliminating the Prevention and Public 
Health Fund, a program under ObamaCare identified as rife with 
mismanagement and taxpayer abuse.
  While full repeal would have been less costly and painful, the 
gradual failure of the Affordable Care Act is inflicting significant 
pain on families, businesses, and our economy. Don't take my word. Just 
listen to the Senator from Montana. His recent remarks aren't far off 
the mark.
