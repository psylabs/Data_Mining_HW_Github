                           HEALTH ACT OF 2011

  (Mr. FLAKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the legislation 
we'll vote on shortly to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board 
created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This is 
something that simply should not have been done. These are unelected 
board members, 15 of them, appointed by the President, tasked for 
finding savings and making recommendations.
  Unfortunately, because of the limitations of what the board can cut, 
the majority of spending reductions will come from cutting 
reimbursements for doctors and those who care for Medicare patients. 
The ultimate result will be fewer options for patients when doctors are 
driven out of the Medicare system.
  We were told when the Affordable Care Act was passed that it would 
lead to a reduction in premiums. It's done exactly the opposite.
  This kind of board and these kinds of decisions made by unelected 
officials will simply drive the cost up further, and we cannot afford 
to do that.
  My only regret in today's action is that we're not repealing the 
entire act. I hope that comes soon.
