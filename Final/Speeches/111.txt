                     AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ENROLLMENT

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I stand here first to salute those who 
advocate against domestic violence and those who advocate for more 
stroke awareness--health care issues.
  I also stand here not only as a Member of Congress, but as a person 
who has navigated the online health care insurance marketplace system, 
so let me note some facts.
  Yes, there have been problems. Unfortunately, the Web site was not 
prepared to handle the huge volume of interest, but President Obama has 
made it clear that the delays on the Web site are unacceptable and they 
will be fixed.
  Since the marketplace has opened, healthcare.gov has had over 20 
million unique visitors. And while the site is being improved, 
consumers should keep in mind what we haven't heard from my colleagues, 
that there are four ways they can apply for coverage: by phone, online, 
by mail with a paper application, or with the help of an in-person 
assistant.
  I say to you, let us not forget the point that millions of Americans 
are now able to choose an insurance plan that will make the most sense 
for them and for their family.
