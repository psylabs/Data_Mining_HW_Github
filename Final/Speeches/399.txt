                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ED PERLMUTTER

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 11, 2013

  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, on August 2, 2013 I was not present to 
vote on the Motion to Recommit and Final Passage of H.R. 2009--the 
``Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act of 2013.'' I want to inform you 
that if present I would have voted: ``aye'' on the Motion to Recommit 
to H.R. 2009; and ``nay'' on Final Passage of H.R. 2009.
  The legislation prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury, or any 
delegate of the Secretary, from implementing or enforcing any 
provisions of or amendments made by the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
of 2010.
  This bill marks the 40th time House Republicans have brought forth 
legislation seeking to repeal, obstruct and undermine the Affordable 
Care Act. It is time for Congress to focus on legislation that 
strengthens the middle-class, creates jobs and grows the economy.
