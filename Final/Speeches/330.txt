                       HEALTH CARE REFORM REPEAL

  (Mr. FINCHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. FINCHER. When the Congress passed the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act last year, it was promised that Americans would 
have better access, more affordable and higher quality care. Instead, 
ObamaCare created what we all despise and know won't work--more 
government bureaucracy at taxpayer expense: $500 billion in new taxes, 
$500 billion in Medicare cuts, more government bureaucracy, thousands 
of new IRS employees.
  What we need for the American people is transparency and 
accountability. Do I need to remind our colleagues that the approval 
rating of Congress is at an all-time low because we're not listening to 
the folks?
  We were sent here in November to do a job, and that's exactly what 
we're going to do. We're going to keep our promises we made to the 
American people, and we're going to hold true to that.
  So I stand in favor of repealing the health care bill. We have to 
create jobs and get our economy moving. If we allow this health care 
bill to stay in effect, that will not do.
