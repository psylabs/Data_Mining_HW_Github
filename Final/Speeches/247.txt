                               speech of

                         HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, January 20, 2011

  Mr. CONYERS. Dear Madam Speaker, I inadvertently voted ``no'' on the 
Matheson amendment to H. Res. 9, which would instruct the committee of 
jurisdiction to include a permanent fix to the Medicare physician 
payment formula in legislation to replace the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act. I intended to vote ``yes'' on the Matheson 
amendment.
  I have always been a strong supporter of having the most optimal 
Medicare reimbursement rate for our nation's physicians. This is 
because the level of Medicare reimbursement rates to physicians does 
have a significant impact on the quality and level of health care 
physicians will provide to our nation's senior citizens and disabled.
