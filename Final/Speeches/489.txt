                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 177

  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am told that S. 177 is at the desk and 
due for a second reading. Is that correct?
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.
  The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 177) to repeal the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
     Reconciliation Act of 2010 entirely.

  Mr. REID. Madam President, I object to any further proceedings with 
respect to this bill.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar.
