  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, for the past 
48 years, Medicare has provided seniors and the disabled with the 
quality health care, economic security and peace of mind they deserve. 
Because of Medicare, millions of Americans have been able to grow old 
with respect and dignity instead of mounting medical debt and 
uncertainty.
  Let's not forget: Medicare is a family benefit. As a caregiver for my 
mother, I know firsthand just how important this benefit is to families 
all over New Mexico and America. Without Medicare, my mother would not 
be able to get the health care she needs, and there is absolutely no 
way I would be able to take care of her. Medicare has always been 
personal to me. It's personal to this day.
  This week, House Republicans will vote for the 40th time to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act. Every vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act 
is a vote to undermine Medicare. The Affordable Care Act has already 
strengthened Medicare and saved seniors money by eliminating co-pays 
for preventive care services, closing the prescription drug `donut 
hole' and extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by nearly a 
decade.
  Mr. Speaker, on this day and every day, we must remain committed to 
protecting and strengthening Medicare for today's seniors and for 
future generations.
