                               ACA REPEAL

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today, for the 37th time, the Republicans 
set a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Yet again, this is a 
waste of time and taxpayer resources on pure political posturing, 
rather than working hard on behalf of hardworking American taxpayers.
  As a freshman Member, I can tell you where I stand, and that is in 
100 percent pure full support of the Affordable Care Act.
  Republicans have ignored real problems affecting our country and 
instead have chosen to attack the poor and most vulnerable. Millions of 
Americans are already enjoying protections and benefits under the law. 
In my State of Texas, over 300,000 young adults are able to stay under 
their parents' plan. Over 3 million women and 1.8 million senior 
citizens have access to preventive care. Many more will have insurance 
coverage once the insurance exchanges are in place for 2014.
  Republicans constantly talk about requiring more efficiency and 
reducing redundancy in Federal Government. How about we start reducing 
redundancy right here in Congress? Let's move beyond messaging bills 
and into actual substantive legislation. Let's focus on jobs and grow 
the economy rather than wasting money on repealing the Affordable Care 
Act.
