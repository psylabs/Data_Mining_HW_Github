                    AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE

  (Mr. ROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, recently, I received an email from a woman in 
my district named Shannon. Shannon received a letter from her health 
care provider stating that her current health care policy did not meet 
the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and that she would have to 
choose a new plan or go to the health care marketplace and find 
coverage.
  She went to the health care marketplace and found a comparable plan 
that cost $400 a month more. This is outrageous. More than 300,000 
Floridians, like Shannon, received letters that their current health 
care plans were canceled. Premiums and deductibles are increasing for 
countless Americans. So many people received notices that their plans 
were canceled. We have only begun to experience the devastating effects 
of this law.
  I submit that the next concern of my constituents will be not only 
that they can't keep their health care plan, but they won't be able to 
keep their doctors. We need to get rid of this law, and we need to 
replace it with one that is consumer-focused and market-driven so that 
Americans like Shannon can get affordable health care coverage and keep 
their doctors.
