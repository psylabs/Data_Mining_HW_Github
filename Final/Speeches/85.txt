                  BENEFITS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the ways that young 
people in my congressional district and around the country are 
benefiting from the Affordable Care Act.
  Before health reform, young adults were the age group most likely to 
be uninsured, losing their coverage right after they left home and 
entered the workforce; but thanks to the health reform law, 2\1/2\ 
million young people, including nearly 10,000 in my communities, now 
have health insurance. And some of them have reached out to tell us how 
the law is working for them and for their families.
  Jamie from Santa Barbara wrote:

       I got back on my parents' insurance and was finally able to 
     visit the dentist and get a new prescription for eyeglasses 
     that I desperately needed.

  Maria from Oxnard says:

       As a recent graduate. I felt completely vulnerable. With 
     health care reform, I am now able to stay with my parents' 
     health insurance, which has given me peace of mind while I 
     search for employment.

  Madam Speaker, health reform is working for young people on 
California's central coast. We must ensure the law stays strong to keep 
them and their families healthy, and I'll say the same for this entire 
Nation.
