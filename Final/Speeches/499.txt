                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1592

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told there is a bill at the desk, and I 
ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1592) to provide for a delay of the individual 
     mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
     until the American Health Benefit Exchanges are functioning 
     properly.

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading on this 
measure and, in order to place the bill on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I object to my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.

                          ____________________
