                   REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. JOYCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOYCE. I rise in support of repealing the Affordable Care Act and 
preventing Ohioans from having to deal with higher health costs, $1.1 
trillion in tax hikes, and more government intrusion in their health 
care. As we near the full implementation of the health care law, it 
seems as though every day we receive more evidence that this law will 
increase health costs for ordinary Ohioans, place an enormous burden on 
Ohio small businesses owners--making it harder for those businesses to 
hire new workers--and insert more big government in between Ohioans and 
their doctors.
  My district in northeastern Ohio is home to several medical device 
manufacturing companies which will be especially hurt by the health 
care law's onerous medical device tax. It's crucial we repeal this law 
and replace it with commonsense health care legislation. Jobs and 
affordable health care are at stake.
