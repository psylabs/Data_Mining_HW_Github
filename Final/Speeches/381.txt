         THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER BRINGS MORE CHAOS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act becomes more 
apparent every day that goes by, and the problems that are contained 
therein. Indeed, the President's takeover of health care is delivering 
more chaos to our health care system.
  We have 26 States that are not going to be participating in State 
exchanges, so a Federal exchange will be set up in those States. The 
complex eligibility process that citizens will have to go through, the 
exchange of personal information with Federal agencies that they are 
going to be required to provide, is truly staggering. Once an 
individual submits an application to an exchange, the information is 
then shared with Health and Human Services, the Social Security 
Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury 
Department, and the IRS.
  Enrollees will not only have to submit all of their information when 
they first enroll, but they will have to resubmit every year.
  The President's law intends that exchanges will be ready by October 
1. Let me tell you, the five Federal agencies that are involved in this 
are not forthcoming with the information that they're, in fact, on 
track. And, in fact, the informatics piece, the information piece that 
is supposed to be ready when this is all switched on in October is 
likely not to be ready.
  There was a better way to do this. Republicans had better ideas. 
Governors had better ideas. The administration simply would not listen.
