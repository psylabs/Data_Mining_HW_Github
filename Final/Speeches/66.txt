                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that there is plenty to 
disagree about in Washington, D.C. The House majority continues to 
believe that funding special treatment for Members of Congress in the 
Affordable Care Act is wrong. The House majority continues to believe 
that the American people need a reprieve from the new government 
insurance mandate for 1 year--the same reprieve that has been given to 
businesses, unions, Congress, and other groups. We should all be 
treated equally and fairly under the law, and Congress should have to 
follow the same laws it dictates to the rest of America.
  But as we continue to negotiate over this divide, let's start funding 
the things we agree on. Let's fund veterans programs. Let's fund the 
NIH clinical trials. Let's fund Head Start, WIC programs. Let's open up 
the World War II Memorial. Surely, even in the divided times we live 
in, we could set aside our differences and start reopening the doors of 
government. This shutdown is wrong and the American people are hurting.
  Let's please start working together, getting past our differences, 
finding points of agreement, and let's forge ahead together united as 
Americans.
