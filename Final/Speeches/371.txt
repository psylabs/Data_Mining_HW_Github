                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 4, 2011

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, yesterday (5/3/11) during consideration of 
H.R. 1213, a bill to repeal mandatory funding provided to States in the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to establish American Health 
Benefit Exchanges, I stepped away from the House floor to speak with a 
constituent and inadvertently missed a vote (roll No. 283) on the 
Ellison of Minnesota Amendment No. 3 (H. Amdt. 262). If I had been 
present, I would have voted ``no.''
