     AMERICA'S AFFORDABLE HEALTH CHOICES ACT ADDRESSES PRIMARY CARE

  (Ms. SCHWARTZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, finding a uniquely American solution to 
ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, meaningful health 
coverage must also ensure adequate access to health care providers and 
services.
  Primary care providers are on the front line of our health care 
system, treating acute and chronic problems and keeping costly 
conditions from worsening. Yet, despite this essential role, it is 
primary care where we face the most acute shortages.
  Since 1998, the percentage of residents choosing primary care has 
dropped from 50 percent to 20 percent. By 2025, America will have a 
shortage of 46,000 primary care providers.
  I am very proud that the provisions in the health care reform 
legislation that is moving through Congress will address this impending 
crisis. It provides scholarships and loan repayments to primary care 
providers. It increases payments for primary care services. It 
eliminates copayments for Medicare beneficiaries who seek preventative 
care, and it creates incentives for doctors and nurses to coordinate 
care for patients with multiple chronic conditions.
  These are significant reforms that will improve access to primary 
care, that will improve health outcomes, and that will improve health 
care costs. We should support better health care for Americans by 
supporting health care reform.
