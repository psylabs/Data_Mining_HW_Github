                                PROGRAM

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senators should expect the first vote of 
the day to begin at 12 noon. That vote will be on the motion to proceed 
to S.J. Res. 39, a joint resolution providing for congressional 
disapproval of a rule relating to status as a grandfathered health plan 
under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We are also 
working on an agreement to complete action on the continuing resolution 
tomorrow. Senators will be notified when any additional votes are 
scheduled.
