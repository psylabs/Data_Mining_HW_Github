                         ACA AND BREAST CANCER

  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight how the 
Affordable Care Act is already helping thousands of breast cancer 
survivors and those with preexisting conditions.
  In late 2007, I heard those terrible words, ``You have breast 
cancer.'' I underwent seven surgeries, but in some ways, I was one of 
the fortunate ones because I had health insurance coverage.
  I have spoken to women who have foregone mammograms and even cancer 
treatments because the cost was simply too great to bear. Now, the 
Affordable Care Act emphasizes prevention by making it possible for 
Americans to get screenings, like mammograms, without a copay.
  It also finally ends the egregious practice of denying coverage to 
patients with preexisting conditions, like my south Florida constituent 
Carolyn Newman, a survivor who will save $7,000 a year with an 
affordable plan, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. She can save even 
more by shopping on the exchange.
  With the Affordable Care Act making it possible for more women to 
access preventive services and not be denied coverage, we can work to 
eradicate breast cancer once and for all.
