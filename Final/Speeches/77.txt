            LOOK AT WHAT'S REALLY IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Now that it's the law of the land, it's time for 
everyone in the country to take a deep breath and look at what really 
is in the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare.
  If you're a senior citizen, you're now receiving a 50 percent 
discount on brand name drugs if you fall into what is called the 
doughnut hole, the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap.
  If you're a woman, you now have free coverage of lifesaving 
preventive services such as mammograms; and beginning on August 1, free 
coverage is going to include many additional preventive care services, 
so take a good look at that.
  If you're a parent, if you have children under age 19, they cannot be 
denied coverage by an insurance company because they have a preexisting 
condition.
  And if you're a young adult, you can now stay on your parents' health 
care plan until your 26th birthday, which is really important if you 
don't have a job that has health insurance coverage.
  And if you're a small business owner, like my son is, there are 
millions now of eligible small business owners that are receiving tax 
credits if you choose to offer coverage to your employees.
  So take a look. It's really good for most Americans.
