                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as the 2-year anniversary 
of the President's so-called Affordable Care Act approaches, we're 
reminded of the unkept promises. It almost seems like yesterday when we 
heard the line, ``We have to pass the bill so we can find out what's in 
it.'' That prediction

today stands as one of the few justifications for passage of the law to 
still hold much truth or credibility.
  Then supporters said it wouldn't cost a dime; yet last week, the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated they now expect the law 
to cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years. That's nearly double the $940 
billion originally claimed.
  Supporters said it would bring down costs; yet these new mandates 
have helped result in premium increases of up to 9 percent in my home 
State of Pennsylvania.
  Today we remain committed to repealing and replacing this costly and 
dangerous law, piece by piece, if necessary. We take a great step today 
by repealing a provision that would otherwise cede the responsibility 
of Congress to an unelected and unaccountable Medicare rationing board. 
This measure is yet another facet of that commitment.
