                REPEAL THE EMPLOYER MANDATE IN OBAMACARE

  (Mr. BARROW of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BARROW of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, just over a week ago, the 
administration announced a 1-year delay of the employer mandate in the 
Affordable Care Act. While a temporary delay is a good thing for 
businesses, a full repeal would be even better. Businesses in my 
district in Georgia have made very clear that the employer mandate 
would prevent them from expanding their businesses or hiring workers. 
One of the main reasons I voted against the law in the first place was 
because too many job creators in my district simply can't afford the 
costs of the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act.
  We can fix this, however. I'm proud to be leading the effort to fully 
repeal the employer mandate, along with two of my colleagues from 
across the aisle. We know this can be fixed, and we've got the 
bipartisan legislation to do it. I urge my colleagues to swiftly bring 
up the full repeal of the employer mandate and make this delay 
permanent so businesses across the country can get back to creating the 
jobs we need.
