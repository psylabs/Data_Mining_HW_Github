            STOP THE OBSTRUCTION AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the healthcare.gov Web site glitches are 
truly unacceptable, and they must be fixed as quickly as possible.
  However, the majority party is not talking about fixing the Web site. 
They are fixated on criticizing the Affordable Care Act instead of 
helping the American public understand the act and receive the benefits 
of true affordable care.
  Countless hours in committees, over 40 votes to repeal and delay, and 
millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on delaying, defunding and 
undermining this law. Throwing sticks into the spokes of the law will 
not help to make it better. I urge my colleagues to stop the 
obstruction and to be part of the solution.
