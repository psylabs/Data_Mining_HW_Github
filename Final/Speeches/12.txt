                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H7115]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues this morning 
talked about creating jobs, and I am delighted to be one of those who 
saw and advocated in the Affordable Care Act the expansion of service 
and use on behalf of the American people.
  First, as a woman, let me say for women, the Affordable Care Act will 
take away forever this dastardly assessment that pregnancy was a 
preexisting disease. The lifetime caps will be removed for women. The 
costs are going down for women. In fact, a small business owner 
indicated that she was going to save $10,000 on her insurance.
  This creates jobs, scholarships for medical professionals, doctors, 
nurses, and expands the federally-qualified clinics.
  The Affordable Care Act is here to stay, with consumer protection 
that will provide for the right kind of health care for the American 
people.
  Don't be fooled. It is going to be the civil rights legislation of 
the 21st century: women given dignity, children provided health care, 
seniors not denied health care.
  I am delighted that this particular legislation is going to be what 
we desired it to be: civil rights and health care for all Americans.
