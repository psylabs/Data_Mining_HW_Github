                       HONESTY ABOUT HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, my friends across the aisle like to say 
they support small business owners, but other than keeping fact-
checkers employed, Republican leaders are holding back those businesses 
by continuing to make false claims about the Affordable Care Act.
  In my Louisville district, more than 15,000 small businesses could 
qualify for tax credits to help offset the cost of providing health 
insurance for their employees. A small business with 24 employees 
paying average health care costs could receive almost $40,000 a year in 
tax credits right now under the Affordable Care Act, but only 530 out 
of those 15,000 businesses have taken advantage of it. The situation is 
like that across the country.
  Why is that? Could it be that the people they elected to represent 
them in Congress have repeatedly told them that this law is bad for 
business?
  As Members of Congress, I believe it is our responsibility to give 
our constituents an honest and accurate picture of what Federal laws 
and policies will do to affect their lives. And yet more than 2 years 
after the Affordable Care Act became law, Republican leaders continue 
to make false claims about it.
  Mr. Speaker, the small business owners in my district appreciate 
knowing the truth about how Federal laws can benefit them.
