                   REPAIRING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, my son played basketball at Dillard 
University. I went down to see his games as often as I could. On one 
occasion, we were driving around in his car, we were at a busy 
intersection, and the car stops. I didn't know what was wrong, but 
eventually I realized that he simply didn't have gas in it. I was not 
happy, but I didn't stand outside of the car and just continue to talk 
to him about the fact that the car stopped running and needed gas.
  What we did is, we tried to get some gas to get the car out of the 
busy intersection because a lot of people were trying to get by. It 
would have been of no value for me to stand there and lecture him or 
talk about how horrible the situation was. We wanted to fix it.
  That is the same thing with the Affordable Care Act. There are some 
problems. I think it would be crazy for anybody to say there are not 
problems. The law has already been passed by Congress, signed by the 
President, and

upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States.
  We would be infinitely better off if we gave our time to repairing 
the problems that are there as opposed to standing in the intersection 
talking about how bad it is.
