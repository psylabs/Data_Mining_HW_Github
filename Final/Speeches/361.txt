           By Mr. PRICE of Georgia:
       H.R. 2300.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Consistent with the original understanding of the commerce 
     clause, the authority to enact this legislation is found in 
     Clause 3 of Section 8, Article 1 of the Constitution.
       The bill repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
     Act, which exceeds the authority vested in Congress by the 
     Constitution.
       Finally, the bill removed government intrusion into the 
     doctor-patient relationship, which is protected by the Ninth 
     and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution.
