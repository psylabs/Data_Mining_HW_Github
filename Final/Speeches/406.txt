                OBAMACARE INCREASES HEALTHCARE SPENDING

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the White House 
claimed ObamaCare is partially responsible for helping to slow the 
growth rate in health care spending. Health care spending did grow at a 
record slow pace in 2012. Unfortunately, according to NPR:

       The Federal officials who compiled the report disagree with 
     the Obama administration about why.

  That's right. The annual report from the actuaries for the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services disagrees with the White House.
  NPR disagrees as well:

       One thing that did not lead to slower growth, according to 
     the report's authors, was the Affordable Care Act.

  ``It's the recession, not ObamaCare, that is slowing health 
spending,'' writes the National Journal.
  Mr. Speaker, hospital costs are increasing. Out-of-pocket costs 
continue to increase, and any reduction in the rate of growth isn't due 
to the Affordable Care Act.
  A closer look at the numbers shows us that this law has made matters 
worse. A closer look at the numbers tells us more about what the White 
House would rather not discuss. A closer look tells us that the 
American people deserve better.
