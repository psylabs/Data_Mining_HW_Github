                        THE SUPREME COURT RULING

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I'm proud of 
the decision of the United States Supreme Court today. I was proud to 
serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee that actually drafted this 
bill. I read it many times, and I actually had a lot of amendments.
  The Affordable Care Act has already benefited millions of Americans 
and will continue to help those who are in the greatest of need--
children, young adults, people with preexisting conditions, and our 
seniors. In my own congressional district in Texas, this is 
particularly important because we have one of the highest rates of 
uninsured individuals in the country.
  Our Constitution gives the U.S. Supreme Court the job to be the 
decider on what is constitutional. The Affordable Care Act is 
constitutional. Just like Social Security and Medicare, now it's the 
law of this great Nation.
