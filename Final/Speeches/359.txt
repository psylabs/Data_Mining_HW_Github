                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, on September 12, 2013, I was absent from 
the House and missed rollcall votes 458 and 459.
  Had I been present for rollcall vote 458, on passage of H.R. 2775, to 
condition the provision of premium and cost-sharing subsidies under the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act upon a certification that a 
program to verify household income and other qualifications for such 
subsidies is operational, and for other purposes, I would have voted 
``No.''
  Had I been present for rollcall vote 459, on approving the Journal, I 
would have voted ``no.''
