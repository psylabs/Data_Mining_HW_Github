                               OBAMACARE

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of one of my 
constituents' experiences with the Affordable Care Act, Allan, from 
Santa Barbara County.
  Prior to the Affordable Care Act, his wife was paying $20,000 a year 
in insurance premiums. She has a preexisting condition. Even though it 
costs so much, she was thankful to have any coverage at all.
  When Covered California, our online marketplace, opened, she made a 
call, looked at her options, and found a plan that works for her. This 
plan saved them $8,000 a year, and it was a much better plan.
  We know that the rollout nationally has been sloppy, that the law is 
not perfect, and that there are real issues we must fix. We must fix 
those problems without diminishing the true benefits the law is giving 
to families in my district and across the country. So now is the time 
to work together to ensure all Americans have access to quality, 
affordable health care.
