                   SUPPORTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
express my strong support for the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act. In the past, no group has been more negatively impacted by 
rising health care costs than seniors.
  Because of the Affordable Care Act, some of the financial burdens 
have been alleviated. The Affordable Care Act has already helped to 
close the Medicare part D doughnut hole by saving 6.6 million seniors 
more than $7 billion on prescription drugs. It also provides a free 
annual wellness visit and coverage for key preventive services that 
many seniors avoid because of high cost.
  As for waste and fraud in Medicare, the Affordable Care Act 
strengthens the system and gives more effective tools to identify and 
remove the unnecessary costs.
  The Affordable Care Act not only provides essential quality care; it 
does so while lowering costs for our aging population. I am proud to 
stand with my colleagues and the President to support the Affordable 
Care Act.
