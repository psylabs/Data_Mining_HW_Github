                      AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DEADLINE

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, with the deadline to sign up for the 
Affordable Care Act approaching, I want to encourage everyone, 
especially young people and people in my district, to sign up for 
health insurance.
  For those who think the process is too cumbersome or you won't get an 
affordable rate, listen to this story from a 29-year-old woman from New 
Jersey, Fawziah Qadir. She said: My employer agreed to provide $300 a 
month towards any health plan I could find.
  Unfortunately, trying to find an affordable insurance plan on her own 
in New Jersey where she lives, she said, was insane. One quote was over 
$700; others provided flimsy coverage.
  Full of frustration, Fawziah's mother told her about the health care 
insurance marketplace. She says that when she logged onto 
healthcare.gov, she was surprised to find out how easy it was to 
enroll.
  With her employer's contribution, she has a comprehensive plan that 
costs just $63 a month. That is less than a cell phone bill or a cable 
bill, and we are talking about something much more important--our 
Nation's health.
  Don't wait. Go to healthcare.gov and find a plan that works for you.
