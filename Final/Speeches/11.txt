                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to tell the story of the 
Montez Family, who live in my congressional district in Colorado.
  They live in Arvada, Colorado, and because of the Affordable Care 
Act, they will now be able to afford health insurance. This is a 
success story of the Affordable Care Act and of its improving access to 
quality, affordable health care.
  Both Joaquin and Rosalee Montez are employed, but neither of their 
employers provides coverage to their employees. They have a daughter in 
college, a 13-year-old son, and a 4-year-old daughter. With rates 
ranging from $450 to $600 per month, purchasing private insurance was 
too expensive for the Montez Family, especially with three kids, a 
house payment, and a car payment. Due to a constrained budget, the only 
time the kids were receiving health care was when they were ``really, 
really, really sick,'' and always at an urgent care center. One time 
after their daughter got E. coli, the Montez Family was stuck with a 
$17,000 hospital bill.
  Thanks to the help of a navigator, they were able to get insurance 
through the Affordable Care Act, which is a success for this Nation.
