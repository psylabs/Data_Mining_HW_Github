                    NATIONAL LATINO ENROLLMENT WEEK

  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, the administration has declared this week to 
be National Latino Enrollment Week in the hopes of mounting a special 
push--a big rush--of Latinos rushing to sign up for the Affordable Care 
Act because it is supposedly going to help their lives in so many ways. 
Yet Latinos nationwide, like millions of other Americans, are 
discovering that they just can't afford the Affordable Care Act. Not 
only is it causing them to lose coverage, but they also see their 
premiums rise and have their health care plans canceled.
  The Spanish site that the administration promised would help people 
enroll reads as if it were written by a first-year Spanish student, and 
it has proven to have more problems than the actual English version of 
healthcare.gov.
  Where we live in the Central Valley, Latinos already struggle to 
access doctors. We have got a huge shortage of doctors, doctors that 
are willing to take Medicare and Medicaid, because of the reimbursement 
rates. So now, with the Affordable Care Act, we are going to have even 
fewer doctors and less access. Health care reform that doesn't increase 
their access is meaningless. The Affordable Care Act has also 
heightened their struggles.
  Mr. Speaker, we must repeal and replace this damaging law with one 
that benefits the Latino community and millions of others across the 
country.
