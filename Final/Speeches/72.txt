                       AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FIXES

  (Mr. BARBER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BARBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about commonsense 
actions we must take to fix the health care law. I wasn't in Congress 
in March of 2010 and I didn't vote for the Affordable Care Act, but I'm 
here today to ensure that it meets the needs of small businesses and 
middle class families.
  That's why I've spent a lot of time listening to small business 
owners and staff, to seniors, and to hospital employees and physicians 
in Arizona about their concerns. That is why I have cosponsored 
legislation to repeal the medical device tax, the annual tax on health 
insurance, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board. These actions 
will protect families and small businesses from premium hikes, and 
protect access to health care for seniors and all Americans. This is 
why I'm working with the citizens of Green Valley in my district to 
keep health care affordable by protecting the tax deduction for medical 
expenses.
  These are but a few examples of how we can come together to fix this 
law. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to find additional ways to do so.
