                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the chaplain of the day asked God to look 
over this Congress. I ask God and think the preacher should have asked 
for direction a little bit further, to look over the Supreme Court, 
because the Supreme Court has in its hands the Affordable Care Act.
  A report was just issued yesterday that said in my home city of 
Memphis, African American women are twice as likely to die of breast 
cancer than Caucasian women. That's unacceptable.
  Part of that is because they don't get the health care they need. The 
Affordable Care Act will see to it that everybody gets access to 
affordable health care, that there won't be a disparity of twice as 
much for the cost of insurance for women than men, and that mammograms 
will be offered to people, ladies, without a co-pay.
  If the Affordable Care Act passes, that disparity in health between 
white women and black women in my city and in America will end. That is 
wrong.
  Part of what's happened in my city is a vestige of Jim Crow, and even 
though those laws have been repealed, we still suffer from them, and 
there is a lot in the Affordable Care Act that will end those. I hope 
the Supreme Court rules on the side of life.
