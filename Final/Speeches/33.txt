                      AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DECISION

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, as a former judge of the North Carolina 
State Supreme Court, I've come to the well today to applaud the United 
States Supreme Court for its courage and for ruling on the side of 
constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. This is a win, Mr. 
Speaker, for 48 million Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, who 
will receive stable, secure, and affordable health coverage forever.
  I believe that much of the public confusion surrounding the bill was 
because Americans outside of the Washington Beltway simply did not 
understand what the Affordable Care Act means for them. So to put it 
plainly, Americans can now enjoy coverage without worry or jeopardy, 
regardless of preexisting conditions. Uninsured young people up to age 
26 will be able to receive coverage. If you become gravely ill, there 
are no limits on your benefits. If you are a woman, you can't be 
charged higher premiums. If you need preventive care, you won't have a 
copay or deductible. If you lose your job, you won't lose your 
coverage. And if your employer doesn't provide coverage, you will be 
able to buy it at affordable prices.
  The political theater Republicans orchestrated around health care is 
over. Congress debated, the Court decided. This is done.
