 INTRODUCING H.R. 5126, ``HELPING SAVE AMERICANS' HEALTH CARE CHOICES 
                                 ACT''

  (Mr. FLEMING asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced H.R. 5126, the 
Helping Save Americans' Health Care Choices Act.
  This important legislation restores the popular Health Savings 
Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts, which are diminished through 
taxation and restrictions under ObamaCare.
  Millions of Americans rely on HSAs to cover deductibles, insurance 
copayments, over-the-counter medications, and a plethora of other 
medical expenses. Furthermore, it is an excellent tool to cut health 
care costs while ObamaCare, itself, provides no such tools. I find it 
extremely ironic that the name of the current law, the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, betrays the fact that it drives up 
costs for patients and for their employers.
  If you truly support health care affordability, I ask all of you to 
support H.R. 5126, which restores this valuable tool that saves costs.
