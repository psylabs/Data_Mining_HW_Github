                         WAR ON WOMEN'S HEALTH

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, over the past several months, we have 
seen Republicans wage war on women's health. Nowhere can the Republican 
zeal for limiting women's access to affordable quality health care be 
seen more clearly than in their attempt to dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act.
  Improving health care has long been a priority for women, reflecting 
their experiences as patients, mothers, and caregivers. For decades 
insurance companies have been able to deny coverage and charge higher 
rates for women simply because of their gender. Thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act--the greatest advancement for women's health in a 
generation--this will no longer be legal. This law moves us closer to 
the day when essential women's health services are covered, prevention 
is a priority, and care is coordinated.
  On the eve of the 2-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, I 
join my colleagues in protecting health care reform for women, and I 
rebuke all attempts to continue discriminatory health insurance 
policies that result in women paying more than men.
