        HEALTH CARE ACT ADVANCES EQUALITY, FREEDOM, AND FAIRNESS

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I pause today to think about history. I 
thought a lot about the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's 
assassination, and today is the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg 
Address. I thought I should bring some words to us from the Address. 
The world can never forget what the soldiers of Gettysburg did:

       It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to 
     the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far 
     so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated 
     to the great task remaining before us--that from these 
     honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for 
     which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we 
     here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in 
     vain--that this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
     freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, 
     for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.

  I am proud to serve in this House where John Kennedy served. I am 
proud to serve in this House where Abraham Lincoln served. It is my 
opinion that part of that work was providing equality, freedom, and 
fairness. I believe President Lincoln would support the Affordable Care 
Act and health care for all.
