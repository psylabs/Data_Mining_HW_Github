                GIVE HEALTH CARE REFORM A CHANCE TO WORK

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, President Obama signed the 
historic Affordable Care Act into law. Since that time, we have seen an 
all-out assault by the special interests and health insurance 
companies.
  Americans are tired of this debate. They are tired of the 
misinformation. Congress must stand up for the middle class. We must 
protect families. We must stop companies from arbitrarily canceling 
coverage after patients become sick, prevent children from being denied 
coverage due to preexisting conditions, and never again let insurance 
companies place lifetime limits on health coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, let's give the reform a chance to work. Reject the 
special interests and extreme rhetoric. Make sure every American family 
is protected when it comes to health care.
