                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, once again, the clock is ticking. And with 
another deadline looming before Congress, Republicans are bullying this 
Nation with the threat of a government shutdown unless we get rid of 
the Affordable Care Act.
  The Republicans have tried over 40 times to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act, and it hasn't gotten them anywhere. Now they've found 
themselves a hostage and they're saying, Give us what we want, or we're 
going to blow up the economy and shut down this government. That will 
cause critical services to be stopped for the American people, which 
could mean that over 3 million veterans will not receive their 
disability benefits, 10 million Americans may not receive their Social 
Security checks on time, and the SEC and EPA will be closed for 
business.
  Careening from one fiscal crisis to the next is no way to run this 
country. That's not how we're supposed to do business. There are enough 
problems in this Nation without Congress manufacturing new ones. Let's 
end this man-made crisis and get to the business of not hurting the 
American people.
