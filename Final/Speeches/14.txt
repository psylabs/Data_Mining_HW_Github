                   THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS WORKING

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is more than a Web 
site; it is affordable, quality health insurance made available to 
everyone.
  While my friends on the other side of the aisle like to keep talking 
about bad stories, there are some good stories about the Affordable 
Care Act, and I have one of them. It is Sarah and Joe, parents of two 
small children from Los Angeles, who have been working very hard every 
day to provide for their family while they were paying a high health 
care premium every month.
  Just last month, they were paying $1,259 a month for COBRA. Last 
week, they got on the exchange, and they enrolled in a Blue Cross 
Silver 70 plan and are now paying more than $400 less a month--less a 
month. Sarah shared with us:

       We are a family of four with two young kids. Regular access 
     to doctors is a must for us.

  This plan does that.
  The recent problems people have encountered on the Web site are 
unacceptable, and they are being fixed. Let's not allow these temporary 
glitches to overshadow the life-changing benefits that the Affordable 
Care Act is bringing to millions of American families like Sarah and 
Joe.
