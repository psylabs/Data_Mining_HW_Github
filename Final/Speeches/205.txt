                  A NEW DAY FOR HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, the prior speaker's prayers are about to be 
answered.
  Mr. Speaker, my State of Kentucky is a national model for how the 
Affordable Care Act can make our constituents' lives more secure and 
their businesses stronger. I would like to share one story. Will 
Russell is the owner of Why Louisville, a small independent business in 
my district that specializes in locally designed clothing and art. The 
father of a 1-year-old, he also has a preexisting condition that led 
insurance companies to deny him coverage for the past 15 years.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, beginning January 1, Will and his 
wife and son will be covered under a plan they found on Kynect, 
Kentucky's health insurance exchange. Will estimates his family will 
save $300 a month. Add that to the peace of mind that comes with 
knowing he will never face medical bankruptcy and the threat of losing 
his thriving business just because he didn't have access to insurance.
  He has been so pleased with the ease and affordability of Kynect that 
he is now exploring coverage for his employees for the first time 
through the State's small business exchange. Mr. Speaker, Will's story 
is one among millions of Americans who are finding expanded care 
through the Affordable Care Act. To quote Will:

       It's going to be a new day for my family, for me, and so 
     many people just like us in Kentucky and throughout the 
     country.
