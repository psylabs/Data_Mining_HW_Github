LET'S NOT PLAY POLITICS WITH THE PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, on June 28 the United States Supreme 
Court ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was 
constitutional. It is now the law of the land, thanks in most part to 
Republican-appointed Chief Justice Roberts.
  Tomorrow, this House is expected to vote on the repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act. Vote again--remember H.R. 2 on January 19 and now 
H.R. 6079. It is, unfortunately, expected that, due to the Republican 
vote, that it will be repealed again.
  How sad, Madam Speaker. How can you face the seniors, the students, 
the women and children and small businesses with this level of 
uncertainty by trying to repeal it again? They are the primary 
beneficiaries.
  Can you explain why? Can you especially explain how this is going to 
add to the deficit? The CBO says so. $100 billion in 10 years, and $1 
trillion in 20 years.
  Madam Speaker, let's not play politics with one of the most important 
pieces of legislation that we have passed.
