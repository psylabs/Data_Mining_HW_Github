                         HON. DONNA F. EDWARDS

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 17, 2009

  Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I object to the anti-choice 
amendment brought forward by Reps. Bart Stupak and Joseph Pitts. The 
Stupak-Pitts amendment goes beyond the scope of current law and 
effectively prohibits private insurers in the health insurance Exchange 
from offering insurance plans with abortion provisions. This amendment 
prohibits the use of federal funds from covering any part of the costs 
of any health care plan that includes coverage of abortion coverage, 
even if federal dollars do not go towards an abortion procedure. This 
amendment truly undermines the spirit of health care reform by 
rationing women's care and taking away current benefits plans that 
include abortion coverage.
  This amendment strips women's legal right to abortion procedures and 
turns back the clock on decades of legal precedent and legislation.
  This is a procedure that some women must consider in the interest of 
their health. This is a choice that no one, not a Member of Congress, 
or government official should make for a woman. This is a woman's 
choice that must be preserved. A woman's reproductive choice has been 
recognized by the Supreme Court of this country, and honored by the 
citizens and lawmakers of this country.
  Please oppose this amendment and protect women's health.
