  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. After 41 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the 
Republicans want the administration to believe that they now want only 
a delay. Why don't they state that forthrightly? Why don't they say 
they are now for the Affordable Care Act, but they want to delay it 
because of certain issues and bring them forward?
  Instead, their call for delay is still about their opposition 
altogether to the Affordable Care Act. One hundred thousand Americans 
are already receiving benefits under the Affordable Care Act. Do you 
really want us to yank them back from benefits that they have never 
received before? That doesn't make a lot of sense.
