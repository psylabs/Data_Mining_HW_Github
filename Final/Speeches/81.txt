                 GOP REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, today the House will consider a repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act for the 31st time. We will spend at least 6 
hours debating this, but not 1 minute considering a Republican 
replacement. That's because there isn't one.
  The American people are now experiencing the benefits of the law: 
allowing young people to stay on their parents' policies until the 
young people are 26; requiring insurance companies to cover children 
regardless of preexisting conditions. The Republican leadership had the 
choice to include those provisions and others in this bill. Yet, once 
again, they are choosing to deny care to millions of Americans instead.
  With this bill, the Republicans are choosing to cut young people off 
of their parents' coverage. They are choosing to end the guaranteed 
coverage for children with juvenile diabetes, autism, asthma, and other 
illnesses. They are choosing to raise prescription drug costs for 
seniors, and they are choosing to allow insurance companies to charge 
women more for the same policies as men.
  Madam Speaker, I invite any Republican in this body to come to the 
floor and to explain to my constituents and theirs why they've made the 
choice to repeal all of these patient protections while offering the 
American people nothing in return.
