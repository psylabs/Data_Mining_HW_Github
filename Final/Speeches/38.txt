                REJECTING REPEAL OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my 
constituent, David Zoltan-Breiger, 33 years old, who now has coverage 
under Illinois' Pre-Existing Condition Plan thanks to the Affordable 
Care Act.
  David has diabetes. Because of his preexisting condition, he couldn't 
get insurance for over 2 years after losing his job. David is 
absolutely elated that he no longer has to wait for hours in the 
emergency room to get lifesaving insulin. Without coverage, the ER was 
his only option. Instead, he now has regular visits with the doctor and 
can avoid the medical crises that had become a frequent nightmare.
  What happens to David under repeal of the bill? He, like so many 
others, would lose coverage and once again be at the mercy of insurance 
companies.
  We cannot go back. We must reject the Republican call for repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act.
