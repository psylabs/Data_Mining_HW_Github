                                CARE ACT

  (Mr. BARBER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BARBER. Mr. Speaker, I believe we have a solemn duty to protect 
the privacy of all Americans. I think all of us here believe that, too.
  I am committed to helping southern Arizonans have access to the 
Affordable Care Act through the healthcare.gov Web site, and we must 
ensure that their personal and medical information is protected.
  That is why I will be introducing the CARE Act, which will require 
that the Department of Homeland Security develop the highest 
cybersecurity standards for healthcare.gov, and for Department of 
Health and Human Services to implement these standards within 90 days.
  In a recent hearing in the Committee on Homeland Security, we learned 
that too little has been done to protect the privacy of Americans 
accessing the Web site. My constituents and the people across this 
country deserve to know that when they interact with this Web site, 
their personal information will be safe and secure. That is what my 
bill ensures.
  I urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans alike, to join 
me in support of this critical legislation.
