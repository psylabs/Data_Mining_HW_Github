                     REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, just last week the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office served a devastating blow to 
President Obama's most frequently uttered promise during debate over 
the Affordable Care Act: ``If you like your present coverage, you can 
keep it.''
  The CBO predicted the law would lead to a net loss of employer-based 
insurance coverage for between three and five million people each year 
between the years of 2019 and 2022, with as many as 20 million 
Americans losing their current insurance plans.
  Now, as we approach the second anniversary of the Affordable Care 
Act, the full impact of this law remains unknown. However, a few things 
are quite clear. Supporters said it would lower costs. It hasn't. They 
said it would improve quality. It hasn't. The President said you can 
keep your current plan if you like it. This clearly is not the case.
  By the administration's own estimates, the new health care 
regulations will force most firms, and up to 80 percent of small 
businesses, to give up their current plans by 2013.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people can't afford another year of the so-
called Affordable Care Act.
