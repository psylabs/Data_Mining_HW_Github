            LET'S NOT RETURN TO A BROKEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

  (Mr. HEINRICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. Speaker, last year we took a desperately needed 
stand for America's families and small businesses over the insurance 
companies. We took a stand against insurance company abuses like 
discrimination against the sick, lifetime limits, the prescription drug 
doughnut hole, and a resulting $1 trillion increase to our deficit.
  We took a stand for hardworking Americans like Vicky Farrar, who 
moved to Albuquerque only to discover that to reenroll in a health 
insurance plan she would end up spending close to a third of her income 
because of her preexisting condition, high blood pressure. That kind of 
skyrocketing cost burden has stunted the dreams of American families 
and small businesses while lining the pockets of insurance company 
CEOs. But thanks to the American Affordable Care Act, Vicky and her 
doctor will be put back in charge of her health care and able to choose 
an affordable insurance policy.
  I urge my colleagues to vote against a return to the broken health 
care system that we spent decades trying to fix.
