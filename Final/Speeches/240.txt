                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
H.R. 3350, the so called ``Keep Your Health Plan Act''.
  This bill is nothing more than the latest Republican effort to delay, 
defund, dismantle, or derail the Affordable Care Act.
  I remain committed to ensuring that my constituents in California and 
millions across the country have access to quality, affordable health 
care.
  Yet, the Republicans want nothing more than to capitalize on any 
opportunity to undermine the fundamental human right to healthcare. And 
that is what this latest attack is.
  While we must certainly address any challenges that arise in the roll 
out and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we cannot undermine 
its effectiveness by passing this cynical bill.
  In fact, just today, I received an email from a constituent who said 
that his plan had been cancelled, but once he had a chance to view the 
options on Covered California--California's healthcare exchange--he 
found a better plan at a better price.
  Stories like this one are happening all over the country and are 
further proof that we must not do anything to undermine the 
implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
  My constituents depend on it, as do millions of Americans.
  I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on this bill.
