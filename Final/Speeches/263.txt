                             ENROLL AMERICA

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today, the White House's permanent campaign 
machine released a television ad promoting the Affordable Care Act and, 
unfortunately, it aims to completely mislead the public. The ad claims 
that Americans are seeing better coverage and lower costs because of 
the Affordable Care Act. That is pure fantasy.
  The fact is that premiums have been ratcheting upward across the 
country. On average, rates in Ohio will go up to almost $200 a month 
because of this law. It's the same story state by state. These rising 
costs clearly have the administration worried that people are going to 
understand how bad the Affordable Care Act is.
  Enroll America is set to spend tens of millions of dollars in 
promoting this law. This is money that they raised by using current and 
former administration officials to unethically, if not illegally, 
strong-arm donations from health care companies that are regulated by 
the Department of Health and Human Services.
  The administration put together a law that hurts families and now 
they have to spend tens of millions of dollars telling people that 
``hey, it ain't so bad.''
  Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty. It should be stopped.
