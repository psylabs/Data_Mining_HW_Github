             ACA RAISES COSTS ON YOUNG AND HEALTHY COVERAGE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, HHS 
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is scheduled to testify before the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee on the massive technological failures of 
the online rollout of the Affordable Care Act; and while some of my 
colleagues would lead you to believe that these are only minor Web site 
glitches, I rise to address a more basic, fundamental flaw in the 
construct of the Affordable Care Act.
  The structure of the design, admittedly by an MIT economist who 
helped create ObamaCare, was to increase rates for the young and 
healthy while decreasing rates for the elderly or sick. The problem is 
this only serves to deter young Americans from purchasing health care 
when faced with the costs of education, a first home, and the prospect 
of starting a family.
  We all want Americans to be covered, but higher premiums for the 
young and healthy to subsidize those who are greater consumers of 
health care was not the bill of goods the American people were 
originally sold. Mr. Speaker, young Americans deserve better.
