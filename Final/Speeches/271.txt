                         UNAFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, all over this country many 
thousands are not being hired because of the so-called Affordable Care 
Act, which is really unaffordable. Many thousands more are seeing their 
hours cut so they do not go over the 30-hour-per-week threshold. 
Someone said the new normal is now two 20-hour-a-week jobs.
  Now the State of Tennessee has had to notify 16,000 Tennesseans they 
can no longer have coverage under CoverTN, a low-cost health care plan 
for small businesses and the self-employed. The plan is being abolished 
because it does not meet all the bureaucratic requirements of 
ObamaCare.
  Senator Lamar Alexander said:

       The new health care law has destroyed an innovative State 
     health insurance plan that is helping 16,000 Tennesseans 
     afford health care coverage.

  When the President was selling ObamaCare to Americans, he said again 
and again that people who had insurance they liked could keep it. 
Despite the President's promises, Tennesseeans enrolled with CoverTN 
are among the thousands of Americans who are being forced to buy new, 
more expensive plans with much higher premiums because of the 
``Unaffordable Care Act.''
