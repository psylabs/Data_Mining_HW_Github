             LET THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WORK FOR FAMILIES

  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I want to share a letter I received from a 
constituent of mine named Mary Ann from Milford, Connecticut. She is 
suffering from cancer, and she wrote to me during the recent Republican 
government shutdown. She wrote:

       I'm attaching a picture I snapped of the statement I 
     received from my insurance company regarding my chemotherapy 
     treatment of the month of July, which was one treatment.

  Over $110,000.

       I'm grateful I have insurance right now, but it's COBRA. It 
     is expensive, and it runs out in 18 months. If the Affordable 
     Care Act is not in place in 18 months, I will never be able 
     to get insurance or treatment.
       This is real for me. It is life or death for me, and I am 
     grateful that President Obama is not willing to negotiate 
     with my life as this Nation is held hostage by political 
     terrorists.

  Mr. Speaker, I receive calls and letters like this every single week. 
The Affordable Care Act is already making a profound difference for 
individuals and their families. Those on the other side of the aisle 
who talk about it is not necessary, they have health insurance. They 
have it.
  Why is it that this body goes on to say ``no'' to health insurance 
for millions of Americans who are out there? This body needs to stop 
partisan political games and let the Affordable Care Act work for 
families. It is a matter of life or death.
