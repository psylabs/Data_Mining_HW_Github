                   REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
urge my Republican colleagues to move beyond the attacks on health care 
for Americans and to move forward by getting our country back to work.
  The majority thinks that it's a badge of honor to claim that it will 
have had 31 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I completely 
disagree.
  They will have voted 31 times to strip patients of basic protections. 
They will have voted 31 times to reverse the progress made by the 
Affordable Care Act, including protecting up to 17 million children who 
now have coverage even if they have preexisting conditions. In fact, 
the 31st vote that we will take is nothing more than a reaction to 
Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion that the law is constitutional. Yet 
the GOP continues to dispute this. Let's move on.
  If they were serious, they would have presented us with a plan 31 
votes ago to help us fix any flaws that this law may have. So I plead 
for the 31st time: let's get back to work.
