                USE POWER OF THE PURSE TO STOP OBAMACARE

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, how do Yucca Mountain, Iran Contra, and 
the Vietnam War relate to the Affordable Care Act? All of those 
represent legislative limitations of funding to counter decisions made 
by the executive branch. In each instance, Congress used its authority 
provided under the Constitution to place limits on Presidential 
decisions. We need to use those constitutional powers again.
  The Affordable Care Act is lurching toward an uncertain start and is 
dramatically different than what was signed into law over 3 years ago. 
Gone are the CLASS Act and the 1099 business activity reporting 
requirement. What about the Federal preexisting program? It hasn't 
accepted a new patient since February of this year.
  How unfair is it that the large corporations in this country received 
an 11th-hour Presidential exemption and Members of Congress receive a 
subsidy? None of this is available to the average American.
  I look at all of this and I ask: What tools are available to prevent 
this disaster? And the answer is provided in the historical record when 
previous Congresses used the one trump card they have available. All 
that is required is the courage and the clarity of vision to alter 
history.
