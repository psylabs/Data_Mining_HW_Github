                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORIES

  (Ms. LEE of California asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is 
already improving access to quality affordable health care for 
millions, including my constituents.
  In my home State, for example, Covered California is a shining 
example of how the Affordable Care Act, when implemented fully, will be 
a success. California's exchange is now enrolling thousands of 
Californians into health care coverage every day.
  Residents in my district, ranging from young adults, to seniors, to 
children with preexisting conditions and those who cannot afford health 
insurance, have been receiving critical protections and savings because 
of the Affordable Care Act.
  In fact, one constituent wrote me recently after receiving a letter 
from his insurance company. After looking at the plans offered through 
Covered California, he was able to find coverage that was both more 
affordable and better for him. He told me that he does not want to put 
insurance companies back in charge and pay higher premiums for less 
coverage.
  Every time Republicans vote to repeal or dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act, they make it perfectly clear that charging women more for 
being a woman is okay, that denying victims of domestic violence 
coverage is okay, and allowing insurance companies to increase premiums 
to increase profits is okay.
