                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. McCAUL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Affordable 
Care Act.
  As the American people know, Members of Congress now are covered by 
this law. And, rightly so, we should engage in the D.C. exchange. I 
want to tell you about my personal experience with the D.C. exchange.
  The President said you can keep your health care plan and that your 
premiums will go down. Mr. Speaker, I lost my health care plan. I have 
five children. My premiums have gone up significantly. I don't know if 
I can keep all the same doctors that treat my children.
  If this is such a great law, why isn't the President of the United 
States covered by this law? On day one, why didn't the President of the 
United States have a Rose Garden ceremony as customer number one under 
his law, ObamaCare, and sign up for this? The answer is that he hasn't 
signed up for it because maybe he doesn't think it is good enough for 
his family, but yet it is good enough for the American people.
  That is the height of hypocrisy and arrogance in Washington, and it 
needs to stop.
