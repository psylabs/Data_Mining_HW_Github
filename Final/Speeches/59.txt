  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the positive 
impact

the Affordable Care Act is having in my home State of California.
  A woman by the name of Melanie wrote the following letter to the L.A. 
Times:

       My daughter and I have been without health care for 3 years 
     following my loss of employer-provided insurance. In that 
     period, I have paid handsomely for those times when my 
     mother-ministrations were not sufficient and I had to seek 
     the care of a very expensive doctor. I've been waiting 
     eagerly for ObamaCare for the two of us since the law was 
     enacted in 2010.
       Did I run into problems when I first tried to sign up in 
     California? I did.
       Did I persevere? I did.
       Did I finally get through? I did.
       In January, I'll be able to take care of a condition I've 
     ignored for the last 2 years, and my college-age daughter 
     will be covered as well. Although the subsidy certainly 
     helps, I will be paying something for coverage we haven't had 
     for years. To those who cry foul, I say ``score.''

  Mr. Speaker, I couldn't have said it better. The reality is that 
because of ObamaCare, millions of vulnerable Americans now ``score.''
