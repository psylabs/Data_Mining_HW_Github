             THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. DENT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, the House will again vote to address the 
imprecisely named Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Critics 
say that we're tilting at windmills. Well, Mr. Speaker, let's review:
  Within the last month or so, we've heard from the Senator who 
authored the law refer to it as a coming ``train wreck''--that's right, 
he called it a ``train wreck'';
  We've heard the administration official responsible for helping set 
up the insurance exchanges worry that the public might be in for a 
``Third World experience'' as they try and find health care;
  Oh, and let us not forget some of the very same Members of Congress 
who voted to foist this massive overreach on Americans are now 
feverishly trying to find ways to exempt themselves and their staffs 
from its effects.
  Let's look at the checklist, shall we?
  Premiums shooting up, check;
  Small businesses hiring fewer workers and jobs being lost, check;
  Employees seeing their hours cut, check;
  Faulty cost projections, check.
  Everything that opponents of this law listed as a reason to vote 
against this example of government overreach is actually occurring and 
happening.
  Tilting at windmills, Mr. Speaker, hardly. Working to protect the 
American people from a horribly disruptive and ineffective law, 
certainly.
