                      AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind Americans today to hurry: 
they have 6 days left to sign up for the Affordable Care Act through 
their Federal and State exchanges and marketplaces. Don't believe the 
hype from the Republicans. The Affordable Care Act is working to 
improve the lives of millions of Americans. More than 5 million 
Americans have signed up so far through the marketplace, and they will 
continue to do so.
  This weekend, I hosted two enrollment events in my district, both in 
Dallas and Fort Worth, and attended two additional ones to ensure that 
constituents in my district get the affordable health care they 
deserve. What I saw when I visited those events were rooms filled with 
men, women, and children looking to provide insurance for their 
families, looking to ensure that they are protected from unforeseen 
sickness and health issues.
  Let's stop playing politics with people's health care. Let's work 
together to get every American covered.
