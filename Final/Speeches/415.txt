                 H.R. 1549: A WIN-WIN FOR CONSERVATIVES

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, tomorrow on the floor of this House, we 
will consider H.R. 1549, the Helping Sick Americans Now Act.
  This bill is a win-win for our constituents. It's compassionate 
towards the most vulnerable.
  Unlike other parts of the Affordable Care Act, which only expand 
broken government-run programs, this program will provide private 
health insurance to sick Americans.
  The bill is fiscally responsible. It reduces the country's deficit 
while redirecting funds from a slush fund while the administration uses 
the Prevention and Public Health Fund money to prop up their train 
wreck of implementation for the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives 
actually want to use it to help sick Americans.
  This bill helps those with preexisting conditions that have no other 
options and provides a fiscally conservative policy that reduces the 
deficit.
  I urge Members of the House to support and pass H.R. 1549 when it's 
on the floor tomorrow.
