                ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Instead of approving the Senate-
passed funding bill, House Republicans have placed politics before 
people while important decisions on government funding and the debt 
ceiling await votes.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with excitement to express my support for 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has already 
significantly improved health care for Americans. In my State of Texas, 
families have saved $46.3 million in insurance company refunds. 
Medicare beneficiaries in the doughnut hole have saved $420.7 million 
in prescription drugs. More than 40,000 Americans and 17 million 
American children with preexisting conditions gained insurance coverage 
through the Affordable Care Act. Because of the health insurance 
marketplaces, in my district, about 204,000 individuals will have 
access to quality, affordable health care coverage.
  The Affordable Care Act will grow stronger and expand access to 
quality care for all Americans.
