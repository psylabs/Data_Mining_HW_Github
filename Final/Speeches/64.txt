                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice 
the concerns of a small business in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional 
District, whose economic security is in jeopardy due to the Affordable 
Care Act.
  The is the story of a sixth-generation, family-run business that has 
been marginally profitable over the years. The business has grown 
through tough times, while staying committed to always providing health 
care insurance through policies that allow their employees the choice 
and the flexibility to have the doctor that they want.
  Since the ACA has taken effect, this business is now facing drastic 
increases in costs, which threaten their profitability and, in turn, 
this threatens jobs in our community.
  The President has offered the American public little assurance that 
he can save the plans, plans that he originally said we could keep. The 
public doesn't need another press conference or PR fix. They need real 
solutions moving forward.
  I commend my 39 Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who joined us in passing the Keep Your Health Plan Act today. These 
Members realize there needs to be accountability in government. The 
American people deserve as much.
