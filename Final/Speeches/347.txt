         H.R. 3590, THE SERVICE MEMBERS HOME OWNERSHIP TAX ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. IKE SKELTON

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 12, 2010

  Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, on August 17, 2009, I became a cosponsor 
of H.R. 3590, the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act. This 
legislation, which passed the House of Representatives on October 8, 
2009, by a vote of 416 to 0, was designed to make certain changes in 
the tax code to assist members of the military in becoming homeowners. 
Thankfully, the legal changes envisioned in H.R. 3590 were included in 
a different bill to extend the first-time homebuyer tax credit that 
received bipartisan support and was signed into law by the President.
  After the military tax issue was resolved, the Senate Majority Leader 
used H.R. 3590 as the legislative vehicle to pass health care reform. 
On December 23, 2009, the Senate adopted a manager's amendment to H.R. 
3590 which removed the provisions of the bill as it passed the House 
and replaced them with provisions of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act. The amendment also changed the title of the bill.
  A public search of legislation I have cosponsored in the 111th 
Congress shows that I am a cosponsor of the original H.R. 3590. I take 
this opportunity to clarify that I cosponsored and voted for the 
Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act, not the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act.
