                   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORY

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I have risen before to talk about the fact 
that the congressional district that I represent has the highest 
uninsured rate out of any congressional district in the entire country.
  About 40 percent of the constituents that I represent don't have 
health care insurance, and I wanted to talk today about how the 
Affordable Care Act is already helping many of those constituents in 
the very district that I represent.
  Yesterday, I found out that a constituent who resides in the district 
I represent, Jason Roberts, had suffered from cancer and that he had 
been running out of options, but when the Affordable Care Act kicked 
in, he found out that his COBRA benefits would be saved.
  Because of the options offered through the Affordable Care Act, 
Jason, who, again, had suffered from cancer, he actually dropped his 
monthly premiums by $251 and his deductible by $1,500. That is an 
overall savings of about $4,500 a year for what Jason describes as 
``great coverage.''
  The simple fact that he and so many others are actually able to keep 
their insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition like Jason 
had with cancer, is a true testament to the benefits of the health care 
law.
  Let's work together to make sure that this health care law works for 
all of the uninsured like Jason and that it continues to work for all 
Americans.
