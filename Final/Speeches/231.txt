                              OBAMA CARES

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, I read my local paper this morning and 
read a reference by Richard Borreca, a reporter who said that the 
Affordable Care Act is known as ObamaCare. At first I cringed because 
that's the way Republicans refer to it. But then I thought about it, 
and you know what? You're absolutely right; Obama cares. That's why we 
have that law.
  Think about what he looked at in 2008 and 2009. There were 50 million 
people who were uninsured at a cost of $116 billion a year. That could 
bankrupt any family. But with the Affordable Care Act, think about what 
you have: women no longer have to be worried about being discriminated 
against as a preexisting condition; seniors don't have to worry, they 
can have preventative care and the doughnut hole will close; youth can 
be covered under their parents' plan to the age of 26; and small 
business can avail themselves of a tax credit.
  Yes, Madam Speaker, Obama cares, as do the Democrats.
