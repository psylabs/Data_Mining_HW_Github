                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this afternoon, I was supposed to be in 
Memphis with the head of the faith-based group from Washington. Because 
of the sequester, she wasn't able to travel. Because of the shutdown, 
I'm here.
  So we had 42 pastors come to my office with the navigators in 
Memphis, and we talked about the Affordable Care Act and how to sign up 
people in the community and what the Affordable Care Act did. It was a 
very beneficial program in telling people in the community how to sign 
people up for needed and important health care. I wish others would do 
the same thing. It would be constructive.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the 
land. We need to help our citizens get adjusted, get involved, and get 
the benefits.
