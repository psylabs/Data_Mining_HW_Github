                 PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE PLAN IS BROKEN

  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, the President's health care plan is broken. 
Let me read from some of the letters and communications my office is 
getting from around my district.

  Mike and Pat in Queen Anne's County write:

       Mr. Harris, my daughter's health care premium just rose 
     $648 a year thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Don't you or 
     other Republicans give up the fight.

  Cindy from Talbot County writes:

       I have just discovered that I can't keep the medical 
     insurance I have had for many years as it no longer exists 
     thanks to ObamaCare. Even though I am 58 years old, I must 
     pay for maternity benefits and pediatric dentistry when I 
     have no child under 19. I get an increased deductible and a 
     premium increase of $143 a month. What a mess that needs to 
     be fixed and in a hurry.

  Finally, Lorraine from Queen Anne's County writes that, in tears, she 
called our office. She was told by her insurer that her premium was 
just increased $256 a month. Her total payment that she and her husband 
now are going to pay is $956 a month, and her insurer told her that it 
went up because of ObamaCare.
  Mr. Speaker, the President's health care plan is broken.
