                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise to give voice to my constituents. 
While I would expect that ObamaCare's thousands of pages would help at 
least a handful of people, a sampling of mail coming into any office 
lets me know that help by the Affordable Care Act is rare.
  Steve from Greenfield says he and his wife are in good health with 
current insurance costing $485 a month. Under ObamaCare, that goes to 
roughly $1,150 a month, a 237 percent increase.
  June from Batavia received a letter from UnitedHealthcare. They are 
discontinuing coverage for most of her family's doctors. And while she 
says she can handle it, it will be a problem for her husband. He has 
stage 4 kidney disease and is on dialysis and will soon not have his 
doctors.
  Don from Loveland says:

       If the Affordable Care Act is allowed to stand, my family 
     will have to come up with an extra $6,600 next year. We can't 
     afford that.

  Mr. Speaker, from what I am seeing, stress and anxiety are becoming 
an increasingly common diagnosis, all due to ObamaCare. The Web site 
isn't the only problem, Mr. Speaker, the law is the problem.
