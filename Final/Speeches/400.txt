                         THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the House Republicans and 
Congressman Ryan released their budget, which, unfortunately, once 
again seeks to balance the budget on the backs of seniors, the middle 
class, and the most vulnerable among us. The GOP budget presents the 
same failed policies that Americans rejected last fall.
  This budget is full of false realities, fuzzy math, and the wrong 
priorities. Instead of closing the corporate jet loophole, the 
Republican budget ends Medicare as we know it, turning health care for 
seniors into a voucher program. Instead of ending billions in tax 
subsidies for Big Oil, the Republican budget slashes Medicaid for the 
most vulnerable among us, turning it into a block grant program. And 
instead of asking the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share, it 
wants to kick millions of people off health care plans by repealing the 
Affordable Care Act--well, actually, repealing the parts of the 
Affordable Care Act that provide care for people but somehow preserving 
the cost savings and the revenues that it delivers.
  Instead of targeting the most vulnerable communities and placing the 
burden entirely on the middle class, Republicans should work with 
Democrats to put in place a balanced and bipartisan budget that puts 
Americans back to work.
