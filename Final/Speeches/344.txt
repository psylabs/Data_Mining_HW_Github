  (Mr. MEEKS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, really I felt compelled to come because let's 
really talk about what this is. This is the 44th time to try to deny 
people access to health care. That is what it is.
  If you listened to some of my colleagues, you would think that all 
Americans are being denied health care coverage. Number one, we are 
talking about 5 percent, and 5 percent is too much. So what the 
President did today was to say that we are going to make sure that 
those individuals who have lost their coverage, if the insurance 
companies will stand up, they will do the right thing.
  What this says is that what we know is that there are 36 States, most 
of them headed by Republicans, that have already decided they didn't 
want to get involved; they didn't want State exchanges. So they wanted 
to make sure to deny individuals who have preexisting diseases.
  You could come and talk about the people who are saying, Thank you, 
Mr. President, for the Affordable Care Act. Because of my preexisting 
condition, I had been turned down by insurance companies. With 
Affordable Care, that won't happen.
  Young people who don't have insurance, up to age 26, they will still 
be covered because of the Affordable Care Act.
  What this is is a process and an attempt to try to end the Affordable 
Care Act for the 44th time. Let's not do that. Let's give the people 
the right to health care.
