At the base I get the idea and the goal which is to provide affordable healthcare to everyone, however, like most legislation it leaves huge gaps that actually harm a big piece of the citizens it is supposed to help.  The issue comes in how you qualify for the discounts for the healthcare.  Qualifying is based on your poverty level, and if you are currently provided healthcare through work.  That second statement disqualifies a huge number of people.  For instance, say there is a family with only a single income.  The working person is provided healthcare through their job, however, it is very expensive for them to add their children and spouse to their insurance.  Previously they went out and purchased their own insurance which was much cheaper.  Now with ObamaCare that insurance is going away and they must purchase the healthcare through the new legislation.  They fall under the poverty level stipulation, however, since one of them is provided healthcare through their job and they do not pay more than 20% of their income for this healthcare the rest of the family is disqualified from receiving the discounts.  So they must still purchase the healthcare through the ObamaCare system but at the much higher price which is way higher than what they currently pay anyways.  In effect this legislation just harmed a big portion of the lower middle class who have one working member of the family.  This bill helps the very poor and does not really affect the rich and those who have two working family members where healthcare is provided.
