                   SUPPORTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
express my strong support for the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act. In the past, no group has been more negatively impacted by 
rising health care costs than seniors.
  Because of the Affordable Care Act, some of the financial burdens 
have been alleviated. The Affordable Care Act has already helped to 
close the Medicare part D doughnut hole by saving 6.6 million seniors 
more than $7 billion on prescription drugs. It also provides a free 
annual wellness visit and coverage for key preventive services that 
many seniors avoid because of high cost.
  As for waste and fraud in Medicare, the Affordable Care Act 
strengthens the system and gives more effective tools to identify and 
remove the unnecessary costs.
  The Affordable Care Act not only provides essential quality care; it 
does so while lowering costs for our aging population. I am proud to 
stand with my colleagues and the President to support the Affordable 
Care Act.

             OPPOSING THE REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, instead of 
taking steps to create jobs and grow the economy, Republicans yesterday 
voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 37th time.
  The Affordable Care Act is working, and its benefits are being felt 
throughout the country, especially in my home State. Almost 525,000 New 
Mexicans now have access to free preventative services, such as 
mammograms, flu shots and colonoscopy screenings. Almost 19,000 seniors 
have benefited from lower prescription drug costs, and over 26,000 
young adults in New Mexico can stay on their parents' insurance plans 
until they are 26.
  So why in the world would we want to hurt seniors, women and young 
people by repealing the Affordable Care Act?
  Let's not forget that the Affordable Care Act is a job creator. The 
Medicaid expansion alone will create 6,000 to 8,000 jobs in New Mexico 
and will pump more than $5 billion into our economy over the next 6 
years.
  Mr. Speaker, let's stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and 
let's get back to work on behalf of the American people.

                  THE UNAFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reserve, on 
Wednesday, March 6, released an edition of its so-called ``beige book'' 
that said that the President's Affordable Care Act is being cited as a 
reason for layoffs and a slowdown in the economy and a slowdown in 
hiring. The beige book examines economic conditions of the Federal 
Reserve districts across the country through interviews with key 
business contacts, economists, and market experts in each district.
  The Federal Reserve noted:

       Employers in several districts cited the unknown effects of 
     the Affordable Care Act as reasons for planned layoffs and 
     reluctance to hire more staff.

  Supporters of the Affordable Care Act refer to the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office, which noted the law will have only mildly 
negative employment effects. Such defenses are far cries from the 
claims used by supporters of the bill to force passage in 2009 and 
merely remind Americans of the countless broken promises that now 
define the so-called ``Affordable Care Act.''
  The writing is on the wall, Mr. Speaker. The reality is the 
Affordable Care Act is costing American jobs. As more of its 
regulations go into effect, the more employers are going to alter their 
hiring decisions to account for its unaffordable costs.

                       HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 18, 2012

  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, millions of 
Americans are anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the 
constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Many of these individuals 
await this decision in fear, as they stand to lose their sense of 
security if the law is struck down. Since the Affordable Care Act was 
signed into law on March 23, 2010, millions of Americans have already 
benefited from its sweeping reforms, and millions more stand to benefit 
once the law is fully implemented in 2014. Texas has the highest 
percentage of adults without health insurance, and striking down the 
Affordable Care Act will only worsen this predicament for Texans.
  If the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, there will 
be no winners. The Affordable Care Act forces insurance companies to 
play by the rules, giving Americans greater control over their own 
health care. Under the health care law, insurance companies are 
required to publicly justify their actions if they chose to raise rates 
by 10 percent or more, and can no longer impose lifetime dollar limits 
on health benefits. In a major show of support, several insurance 
companies, including UnitedHealthcare and Aetna, have even pledged to 
preserve certain provisions of the health care law no matter what the 
Supreme Court decides.
  A repeal of the Affordable Care Act would further exacerbate health 
disparities between minorities and non-minorities. Minorities suffer 
disproportionately from serious illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, and 
HIV/AIDS. Historically, minorities have faced considerable barriers to 
accessing affordable health insurance, and these barriers have 
contributed to significant health disparities. Under the Affordable 
Care Act, an estimated 3.8 million African Americans and roughly 5.4 
million Latinos who would otherwise be uninsured will gain coverage by 
2016. If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, millions of minorities 
will be forced to seek primary care in our Nation's overcrowded 
emergency rooms, and the costs of care will be shifted to taxpayers.
  Mr. Speaker, while the Republicans have introduced numerous measures 
to undermine and repeal the Affordable Care Act, they have not yet 
offered one piece of legislation which would reduce health care costs 
for young adults and seniors or address the growing health disparities 
between minorities and non-minorities. As we await this monumental 
court decision, I, along with my Democratic colleagues, will continue 
to advocate for access to affordable, quality health care for all 
Americans.

                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORIES

  (Ms. LEE of California asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is 
already improving access to quality affordable health care for 
millions, including my constituents.
  In my home State, for example, Covered California is a shining 
example of how the Affordable Care Act, when implemented fully, will be 
a success. California's exchange is now enrolling thousands of 
Californians into health care coverage every day.
  Residents in my district, ranging from young adults, to seniors, to 
children with preexisting conditions and those who cannot afford health 
insurance, have been receiving critical protections and savings because 
of the Affordable Care Act.
  In fact, one constituent wrote me recently after receiving a letter 
from his insurance company. After looking at the plans offered through 
Covered California, he was able to find coverage that was both more 
affordable and better for him. He told me that he does not want to put 
insurance companies back in charge and pay higher premiums for less 
coverage.
  Every time Republicans vote to repeal or dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act, they make it perfectly clear that charging women more for 
being a woman is okay, that denying victims of domestic violence 
coverage is okay, and allowing insurance companies to increase premiums 
to increase profits is okay.

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the chaplain of the day asked God to look 
over this Congress. I ask God and think the preacher should have asked 
for direction a little bit further, to look over the Supreme Court, 
because the Supreme Court has in its hands the Affordable Care Act.
  A report was just issued yesterday that said in my home city of 
Memphis, African American women are twice as likely to die of breast 
cancer than Caucasian women. That's unacceptable.
  Part of that is because they don't get the health care they need. The 
Affordable Care Act will see to it that everybody gets access to 
affordable health care, that there won't be a disparity of twice as 
much for the cost of insurance for women than men, and that mammograms 
will be offered to people, ladies, without a co-pay.
  If the Affordable Care Act passes, that disparity in health between 
white women and black women in my city and in America will end. That is 
wrong.
  Part of what's happened in my city is a vestige of Jim Crow, and even 
though those laws have been repealed, we still suffer from them, and 
there is a lot in the Affordable Care Act that will end those. I hope 
the Supreme Court rules on the side of life.

                         Thursday, May 16, 2013

  Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 45--To 
Repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and health care-
related provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
of 2010. This legislation would completely repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, which was signed into law in 2010 and was declared 
constitutionally sound by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The 
Affordable Care Act extends healthcare coverage to all Americans 
regardless of their gender, health condition or ability to pay.
  It is a disgrace that this country, which is the wealthiest country 
in the world, denies universal healthcare coverage to its citizens. 
Repealing the Affordable Care Act will allow this disgrace to continue.
  The Affordable Care Act is a good law. Because of the Affordable Care 
Act, Americans now have access to a wide variety of free preventive 
services; insurers can no longer drop women from coverage when they 
become pregnant; Medicare is stronger due to some of the cost savings 
and other provisions in the act; Seniors are paying less for 
prescription drugs; Americans no longer face lifetime limits on care; 
and families are receiving rebates from insurance companies, when they 
unfairly inflate their costs.
  In fact, thousands of people in my district, the 9th Congressional 
District of Brooklyn, New York, are already benefiting from the 
Affordable Care Act. An analysis done in March of 2012 showed that the 
health care reform law had already:
  Provided 390 small businesses in my district with tax credits to help 
maintain or expand health care coverage for their employees;
  Provided 5,100 young adults in my district with access to health 
insurance coverage under their parents' insurance plan;
  Provided Medicare preventive services, at no costs to the patient, 
for 46,000 seniors in the district;
  And, provided $2.5 million in public health grants for community 
health centers, hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers in 
the district to improve the community's health.
  I have always believed that healthcare is a fundamental right, not a 
privilege. And this is why I vehemently oppose H.R. 45--To Repeal the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It is wrong, and it is a 
step backwards for our country.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Jeffries) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, later on this afternoon, the House will 
vote for the 37th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The Speaker of the House of Representatives has already been on 
record saying that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. So 
it's just not clear to me why we are wasting the time and the treasure 
of the American people on another futile legislative fantasy.
  In fact, it's a legislative fantasy that has cost the American people 
more than $50 million. If, in fact, the Affordable Care Act were to be 
repealed, it would do even more damage, as independent economists have 
estimated that a repeal would add to the Federal deficit by more than 
$100 billion.
  It's often been said that the classic definition of ``insanity'' is 
doing the same thing over and over and over again but somehow expecting 
a different result.
  Barack Obama was elected President in 2008. The Affordable Care Act 
was signed into law in 2010. The Supreme Court, with the Chief Justice 
voting in the majority, held that the Affordable Care Act was 
constitutional in 2012. A few months later, President Barack Obama was 
reelected in an electoral college landslide. Yet, later on this 
afternoon, we're voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 37th 
time--over and over and over again. It's a classic definition of 
legislative insanity, as if the 37th vote is going to be any different, 
will yield any different results than the previous 36 where we've 
wasted the taxpayer dollars of the American people.
  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, and that's a good 
thing. It's a good thing because over the next decade more than 30 
million Americans who otherwise would not have had health care 
insurance will be insured. It seems to me that that's a good thing.
  The Affordable Care Act makes sure that insurance companies cannot 
deny medical coverage for preexisting conditions. It seems to me that 
that's a good thing.
  The Affordable Care Act provides small businesses with a 35 percent 
tax credit, which will enable these small businesses to continue to 
grow and to flourish. It seems to me that that's a good thing.
  The Affordable Care Act allows young Americans who are just starting 
out to remain on the insurance plan of their parents until the age of 
26, giving them a real chance to get themselves started in their 
pursuit of the American Dream. I'm new, but it seems to me that that's 
a good thing.
  Yet later on this afternoon, for the 37th time, we're engaging in 
another futile legislative fantasy.
  There are a couple of other things that we could be doing. We could 
be dealing with the sequester, $85 billion in random cuts that are 
costing the economy more than 500,000 jobs, but we're not.
  We could be debating the American Jobs Act, trying to put the people 
of this great country back to work and stimulate the economy, but we're 
not.
  We could be trying to get a budget, go to conference, create some 
certainty for industry and the American people, but we're not.
  Madam Speaker, I'm hopeful that after this vote is taken, we can 
finally come to the reality that the Affordable Care Act is the law of 
the land, it's good for the American people, and we should get back to 
doing things that will advance prosperity in this great country.

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, this week I introduced legislation that 
will amend the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare, to 
prohibit a bailout for the insurance industry that is currently 
authorized under section 1341 and section 1342 of the Affordable Care 
Act.
  The American people have had enough of bailouts for Big Business. It 
is time for this culture of corporate cronyism that has become a 
dominant part of Washington, D.C., to stop. My legislation, No Bailouts 
for the Insurance Industry Act of 2014, would amend the Affordable Care 
Act to repeal section 1341, the ``reinsurance'' fund, and section 1342, 
the ``risk corridor'' provision.
  Together, both can provide for a massive taxpayer bailout to cover 
the insurance industry losses. The taxpayers should not be on the hook 
for the failures of ObamaCare. Any reasonable person can see that this 
scheme isn't going to work, and the American people should not be 
forced to bail it out once it fails.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of the No Bailouts for the Insurance 
Industry Act of 2014.

  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to tell the story of the 
Montez Family, who live in my congressional district in Colorado.
  They live in Arvada, Colorado, and because of the Affordable Care 
Act, they will now be able to afford health insurance. This is a 
success story of the Affordable Care Act and of its improving access to 
quality, affordable health care.
  Both Joaquin and Rosalee Montez are employed, but neither of their 
employers provides coverage to their employees. They have a daughter in 
college, a 13-year-old son, and a 4-year-old daughter. With rates 
ranging from $450 to $600 per month, purchasing private insurance was 
too expensive for the Montez Family, especially with three kids, a 
house payment, and a car payment. Due to a constrained budget, the only 
time the kids were receiving health care was when they were ``really, 
really, really sick,'' and always at an urgent care center. One time 
after their daughter got E. coli, the Montez Family was stuck with a 
$17,000 hospital bill.
  Thanks to the help of a navigator, they were able to get insurance 
through the Affordable Care Act, which is a success for this Nation.

  First, as a woman, let me say for women, the Affordable Care Act will 
take away forever this dastardly assessment that pregnancy was a 
preexisting disease. The lifetime caps will be removed for women. The 
costs are going down for women. In fact, a small business owner 
indicated that she was going to save $10,000 on her insurance.
  This creates jobs, scholarships for medical professionals, doctors, 
nurses, and expands the federally-qualified clinics.
  The Affordable Care Act is here to stay, with consumer protection 
that will provide for the right kind of health care for the American 
people.
  Don't be fooled. It is going to be the civil rights legislation of 
the 21st century: women given dignity, children provided health care, 
seniors not denied health care.
  I am delighted that this particular legislation is going to be what 
we desired it to be: civil rights and health care for all Americans.

  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is more than a Web 
site; it is affordable, quality health insurance made available to 
everyone.
  While my friends on the other side of the aisle like to keep talking 
about bad stories, there are some good stories about the Affordable 
Care Act, and I have one of them. It is Sarah and Joe, parents of two 
small children from Los Angeles, who have been working very hard every 
day to provide for their family while they were paying a high health 
care premium every month.
  Just last month, they were paying $1,259 a month for COBRA. Last 
week, they got on the exchange, and they enrolled in a Blue Cross 
Silver 70 plan and are now paying more than $400 less a month--less a 
month. Sarah shared with us:

       We are a family of four with two young kids. Regular access 
     to doctors is a must for us.

  This plan does that.
  The recent problems people have encountered on the Web site are 
unacceptable, and they are being fixed. Let's not allow these temporary 
glitches to overshadow the life-changing benefits that the Affordable 
Care Act is bringing to millions of American families like Sarah and 
Joe.

  (Ms. CLARKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, at the time that President Obama was first 
inaugurated, it was clear to most Americans that we had a crisis in the 
health care system: the cost of premiums was skyrocketing every year, 
millions of American families did not have health insurance, and many 
of the health insurance plans that existed were inadequate, providing 
coverage that was essentially useless when someone had a serious health 
problem or a preexisting condition. Our seniors enrolled in Medicare 
were, in many instances, paying hundreds of dollars each month for 
drugs.
  Now the Affordable Care Act in immediate effect addresses this 
crisis. Already, the Affordable Care Act has permitted millions of 
Americans to visit a primary care physician without copayments, 
prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against people with 
preexisting conditions, and now parents are keeping their children on 
their health insurance plans until they're 26 years of age.
  As of Tuesday, across our great Nation, people without health 
insurance at long last have the ability to enroll in health care 
exchanges. The Affordable Care Act, it's the law of the land.

   WOMEN'S HEALTH WEDNESDAY: AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S BENEFITS FOR WOMEN

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, for decades, women 
in this country have unfairly borne the burden of excessive health care 
costs. Fortunately, through the Affordable Care Act, millions of women 
no longer have to worry about going bankrupt if they get sick.
  The Affordable Care Act ensures that being a woman will no longer be 
treated as a preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act bans 
insurance companies from requiring women to obtain a referral for 
access to necessary OB/GYN care and bans insurance companies from 
dropping women when they get sick or pregnant.
  Despite these accomplishments in women's health, the war on women 
continues in Texas. Governor Perry's political decision to forgo nearly 
$40 million in Federal funding for the Texas Medicaid Women's Health 
Program will leave 130,000 women without access to preventative health 
services.
  Despite these obstacles, I will continue to fight for the increased 
access to quality health care for women in Texas.

between the years of 2019 and 2022, with as many as 20 million 
Americans losing their current insurance plans.
  Now, as we approach the second anniversary of the Affordable Care 
Act, the full impact of this law remains unknown. However, a few things 
are quite clear. Supporters said it would lower costs. It hasn't. They 
said it would improve quality. It hasn't. The President said you can 
keep your current plan if you like it. This clearly is not the case.
  By the administration's own estimates, the new health care 
regulations will force most firms, and up to 80 percent of small 
businesses, to give up their current plans by 2013.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people can't afford another year of the so-
called Affordable Care Act.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. HORSFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, it is past time for this Congress to 
work together to improve the Affordable Care Act. This law can be 
improved, but it is also helping people throughout this country and in 
my home State of Nevada.
  One example that I would like to share with you today is that of 
Michelle, a constituent from Pahrump, Nevada. Michelle enrolled in a 
plan on the exchange that will save her $200 per month and allow her 
access to OB-GYN services closer to home. She called her enrollment in 
the program an overwhelmingly positive experience.
  Michelle is currently on a HIPAA-guaranteed plan that costs her $565 
a month. If she gets sick and needs an urgent visit, mammogram or other 
OB-GYN services, she has to drive to Las Vegas from Pahrump.
  After enrolling in the Affordable Care Act, she will save more than 
$200 a month and have access to local urgent visit and OB-GYN services 
in Pahrump.
  Madam Speaker, now is not the time to turn back the clock or leave 
constituents like Michelle behind. If Republicans are successful in 
defunding or even delaying the Affordable Care Act, Michelle will lack 
insurance. She will have to go back to the predatory plan that offered 
her no real coverage and costs even more.
  I ask my colleagues on the other side, let's work together to make 
the Affordable Care Act work for the American people.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND 
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. LAURA RICHARDSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, March 21, 2012

  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the second 
anniversary of the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act. In the two years since its enactment, the Affordable Care Act 
has been good for seniors, good for women, good for small businesses, 
and good for all Americans.
  As the Affordable Care Act is implemented, it will continue to expand 
access to affordable, quality health care for over 30 million Americans 
and will work to reign in the ever-escalating costs of health care. 
Passage of the Affordable Care Act was a major step toward fulfilling 
the promise all Americans were pledged: the promise of unalienable 
rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness which quality 
healthcare embodies.
  For the people I represent in the 37th District of California, the 
Affordable Care Act will improve coverage for 299,000 residents who 
already have insurance. It will give tax credits and other assistance 
to up to 146,000 families and 15,100 small businesses to help them 
afford coverage. Health care reform will also improve Medicare for 
63,000 beneficiaries in my district, including closing the prescription 
drug ``donut hole'' once and for all.
  In 2010, the Affordable Care Act made it possible for 354,592 
Medicare beneficiaries in California to receive a $250 rebate to help 
cover the cost of their prescription drugs when they hit the donut 
hole. In 2011, 319,429 Medicare beneficiaries received a 50 percent 
discount--an average savings of $538 per person--on brand-name 
prescription drugs when they hit the coverage gap. That's a total 
savings of over $171 million for seniors in California alone! In my 
district, 3,200 seniors received prescription drug discounts worth $1.5 
million, an average discount of $460 per senior.
  The Affordable Care Act extends coverage to 92,500 uninsured 
residents of the 37th District and will guarantee that 17,500 residents 
with pre-existing conditions can obtain the health insurance they need. 
Since enactment, health care reform has extended insurance coverage to 
5,599 Californians through the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance 
Plan.
  The Affordable Care Act protects 1,100 families from bankruptcy due 
to unaffordable health care costs and currently allows 59,000 young 
adults to obtain coverage on their parents' insurance plans. The new 
law provides millions of dollars in new funding for 11 community health 
centers in my district. And finally, it will reduce the cost of 
uncompensated care for hospitals and other health care providers by 
$125 million annually.
  Mr. Speaker, as we approach the two year anniversary of the enactment 
of the Affordable Care Act, an attack on women's access to affordable, 
quality, and necessary healthcare services is underway. From the 
comments made by Rush Limbaugh about Georgetown Law Student Sandra 
Fluke, to Republican attempts to roll back coverage and restrict access 
to birth control, the GOP's war on women stands in stark contrast 
to the Administration's goal of ensuring that women have access to the 
healthcare services they need to remain healthy.

  As a female Member of Congress, I understand that women have unique 
health care needs, and are often the ones who make health care 
decisions for their families. I voted for and strongly support the 
Affordable Care Act because it provides important benefits for women 
and their families. The Affordable Care Act helps women by eliminating 
the discriminatory gender rating system, making sure that insurance 
companies do not consider pregnancy grounds for denying coverage, and 
doing away with all pre-existing conditions.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all Americans joining new 
insurance plans have the freedom to choose from any primary care 
provider, OB-GYN, or pediatrician in their health plan's network, or 
emergency care outside of the plan's network, without a referral. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, women joining a new health care plan can 
receive recommended preventive services, like mammograms, new baby care 
and well-child visits, and an annual wellness visit with no out-of-
pocket costs. In 2011, over 6 million people with private insurance 
coverage in California gained preventative service coverage with no 
cost sharing as a result of the Affordable Care Act.
  Before enactment of the Affordable Care Act, women could be charged 
more for individual insurance policies simply because of their gender. 
A 22-year-old woman could be charged 150 percent the premium that a 22-
year-old man paid. In 2014, insurers will not be able to charge women 
higher premiums than they charge men. The law takes strong action to 
control health care costs, including helping states crack down on 
excessive premium increases and making sure most of your premium 
dollars go toward your health care.
  The Affordable Care Act also allows young adults under the age of 26 
to stay on their parents' health insurance plan. This provision has 
expanded access to health insurance coverage for 2.5 million young 
people nationwide. In my district, 7,000 young adults have taken 
advantage of this provision and are now covered under their parents' 
plan.

[[Page E405]]

  This week, the House will consider a bill to repeal the Independent 
Payment Advisory Board established under the Affordable Care Act. 
Having previously garnered bipartisan support, the majority's decision 
to attach a medical liability provision to the underlying piece of 
legislation amounts to nothing short of a partisan ploy to score points 
with their base.
  The language attached to the bill would place caps on medical 
malpractice awards for pain and suffering at $250,000 and would 
override most state tort laws. Unfortunately, the majority's decision 
to include tort reform language on a completely unrelated measure 
demonstrates their refusal to work with Members across the aisle in 
order to further strengthen the Affordable Care Act.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act provides American families with 
stability and peace of mind. Never again will they have to choose 
between their health and their livelihood. As a result of the 
Affordable Care Act, 23,000 children and 90,000 adults in my district 
now have health insurance that covers preventive services without 
paying any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles.
  I am proud to be a part of this historic health care policy change, 
and to be part of the days ahead in which we will work to further 
strengthen it.

                     THANK YOU, AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. BROWN of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, my fellow Americans, the results 
are in with the closing of the Affordable Care Act's first-time open 
enrollment period: over 7 million Americans have now secured quality, 
affordable health care coverage for themselves and their families.
  I want to congratulate everyone who signed up. I personally called 
over 30,000 people to encourage them to sign up, and worked at one of 
the sign-up sites over the weekend.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no American could ever again be 
denied coverage for a preexisting condition; no woman can ever again be 
charged a higher premium just because she is a woman; 3 million young 
Americans age 26 and under can stay on their family plan; no American 
ever again will have to worry that one major illness will bankrupt 
their family; no senior will ever have to pay a copayment for key 
preventative services such as cancer screening.
  I want to thank everyone for signing up and not going for the 
okeydoke.

             AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office, CBO, issued a report stating the 
Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare, will slow economic 
growth over the next decade substantially more than previously 
predicted. According to yesterday's report, the Affordable Care Act 
could lead to 2 million fewer workers in the workforce between now and 
2017, which is nearly three times as high as CBO's earlier predictions. 
What is even worse, this number is supposed to rise in later years to 
the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs by 2024.
  According to The Hill newspaper:

       The agency, CBO, also said employer penalties in the law 
     would decrease wages, and part-year workers would be slower 
     to return to the workforce because they would seek to retain 
     ObamaCare insurance subsidies.

  We cannot afford more blows to jobs. We cannot afford more blows to 
the American workforce. We cannot afford more blows to our economy. We 
as policymakers should be focused on breaking down barriers to 
employment in order to increase wages.
  Mr. Speaker, the administration better get better at explaining this 
law to the American people or start working with this body to repeal 
and fix it. The American people deserve better. The American people 
deserve jobs.

            AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STANDS ON A SAND FOUNDATION

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, even the White House's best ObamaCare damage 
control efforts, waivers, delays, penalty deadline, adjustments, and 
temporary fixes sadly leave the so-called Affordable Care Act's sand 
foundation untouched.
  Math undergirding the entire law remains structurally unsound and 
threatens the broader insurance market in this country. That is a shame 
for each and every American.
  As someone who wants to see greater access and affordability in 
health care, and more options for Americans in the individual insurance 
market, it is my hope that the country moves toward a competitive, 
patient-centered system like the one outlined by the House Republican 
Study Committee in the American Health Care Reform Act.
  Something as transformative as health care policy should never be 
forced on the American people on an embarrassingly unstudied and purely 
partisan basis, the way President Obama chose to proceed with the 
Affordable Care Act.

                 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WEB SITE PROBLEMS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, earlier this fall the President said the 
Affordable Care Act is more than just a Web site and that the problems 
with the Web site will soon be fixed. While I don't disagree with 
either of those two statements, I don't understand the timeline 
involved because yesterday in the Oversight and Investigation 
Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the deputy chief 
information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
told us that the Web site was launched, but it wasn't finished upon 
launch.
  I have to ask: Why in the world would they proceed with this if they 
knew it wasn't finished? When asked to give a percentage completion, it 
was confusing. His answer was either 40 or 60 percent; no one really 
knows, and here is the kicker. When you get to January and providers, 
doctors, and hospitals are seeing patients who think they have coverage 
under the Affordable Care Act, part of the problem with the unfinished 
Web site is there may be difficulty in delivering provider payments. 
That is an intolerable situation that must be resolved and must be 
resolved quickly. It could start with the administration being honest 
with the committee about where they are in the development of the Web 
site.

  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that the robust 
provisions passed in the House were significantly reduced in the 
Senate, the people of the Virgin Islands are benefiting in many ways 
from the Affordable Care Act.
  As an example, a physician related to me that the insured 21- to 25-
year-olds and the preventive care without copay kept her practice 
afloat, and the insurance rebate and tax credits for small businesses 
enabled her to provide insurance for her employees without requiring 
contributions from them.
  In addition, seniors and people with disabilities saved an average of 
$647 on medicines. Health centers in my district were able to expand 
space and services; children with sickle cell, asthma, and diabetes 
could be insured; every newborn will get an important home visit; and 
the new Medicaid dollars will enable us to provide coverage for up to 
half of our now uninsured.
  We still have work to do to ensure full access in the Virgin Islands 
and the Nation, but the Affordable Care Act has already made a positive 
difference in the lives of many of our constituents. The ACA is helping 
Americans in all of the States and territories, and we will continue to 
build on its successes, not yield to Republican opportunism and 
obstructionism.

  Mr. LaMALFA Mr. Speaker, again, on the front of the Affordable Care 
Act we have yet another business--this one in northern California, in 
Paradise, California--called California Vocations.
  This is a nonprofit group that helps people with developmental 
disabilities to find employment. This organization has had to drop for 
90 employees its health care coverage because it cannot afford it under 
the Affordable Care Act.
  This week, we will be taking up legislation to give people the 
opportunity, if they like their health insurance, to be able to keep 
it, as was promised by the President. We need to move on this measure 
in order to help the President to keep the promise that he said or 
implied, but more importantly, the promise to the American people that 
they have choice, that they have freedom in this country to make their 
own decisions, not have the heavyhanded government deciding for them 
something that doesn't work or they cannot afford.

         IMPACT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES

  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, during a hearing on the 
Education and Workforce Committee, Secretary Sebelius dismissed 
concerns regarding the impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on 
small businesses as ``speculation.''
  But in my district--and all across this country--the negative impact 
of this law is a sad reality. I've held field hearings in Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, and most recently North Carolina to hear directly from 
job creators about how they will have to cut hours or hire fewer 
employees because of the Affordable Care Act.
  Just this past Sunday, my hometown paper, the Johnson City Press, ran 
an advertisement from a Burger King franchisee owner announcing he was 
being forced to close one of his stores as a result of, among other 
things, ``a law so unfriendly to business and workers it forces the 
business to limit hardworking Americans to less hours and lower pay at 
a time of high unemployment and less opportunity for people to 
prevail.''
  This entrepreneur wants to grow his business, not shrink it. But 
instead, we are limiting his opportunities and those of Tennesseans 
that he would employ. Speculation? I hardly think so. We can--and 
must--do better.

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, 2013, brand-new year, brand-new Congress. 
But what's this year also bringing? How about some brand-new taxes 
under the Affordable Care Act.
  There is a medical device tax that started on January 1 of 2.3 
percent on gross sales. This means some of our smallest companies, 
medical start-up companies, are going to pay a tax not on profits but 
their gross receipts.
  The flexible spending account that many families rely upon to pay for 
recurring expenses with pre-tax dollars, especially those families with 
special needs children, those are now capped at $2,500.
  Investment income, a surtax of 3.8 percent for people who earn above 
a certain level.
  Taxes on medical deductions, it rises from a 7.5 percent reduction to 
10 percent on adjusted gross income. That means our sickest 
constituents are going to be paying more taxes.
  And then, finally, the Medicare payroll tax hike. For the first time, 
individuals who earn investment income are going to be paying a payroll 
tax of .9 percent. There will be an additional .9 percent on other 
income as well.
  Let's be honest, the Affordable Care Act benefits are still over a 
year away, but boy, you got a big tax bill January 1.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 16, 2013

  Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, the GOP needs to reorder its priorities. 
The American people want us to focus on jobs and strengthening our 
economy, instead of relitigating the past. Today is the 37th time the 
majority has taken up repealing patient protections for the American 
people. This is a very bad idea.
   Since January 2011, the House has been in session and held votes on 
only 281 days. Forty-three of those days have been spent on repealing 
the Affordable Care Act alone. That's 15 percent of the American 
people's time spent solely on failed attempts to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act.
   For the party that's seeking to cut their way to prosperity, 
consider this: based on the cost per day to run Congress, the 
Congressional Research Service calculated that the time spent 
attempting to repeal the health law has come with a $52.4 million price 
tag for taxpayers. This money could restore the estimated $41 million 
cut under sequestration to Meals on Wheels nutrition programs across 
the country. Or it could pay for nearly 7,000 children to participate 
in the Head Start program for a year.
   Now, consider the benefits the American people have enjoyed since 
the Affordable Care Act became law: children no longer face 
discrimination due to pre-existing conditions; students and young 
adults are gaining coverage through their parents' plans; Medicare is 
stronger, and seniors are paying less for prescription drugs and 
getting better treatment at lower cost; Americans no longer face 
lifetime limits; families are receiving rebates from insurance 
companies; and women have access to a wide range of free preventive 
services.
  Since the law was enacted in March 2010, over 800,000 jobs have been 
created in the health care industry. So when the GOP says the 
Affordable Care Act is ``killing jobs,'' it's flat out wrong.
   Repealing the Affordable Care Act would leave millions of Americans 
without vital patient protections and has cost the American people 
precious time and money. We should instead vote for legislation to 
create jobs, expand our economy, and strengthen the middle class.

  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to

  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
urge my Republican colleagues to move beyond the attacks on health care 
for Americans and to move forward by getting our country back to work.
  The majority thinks that it's a badge of honor to claim that it will 
have had 31 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I completely 
disagree.
  They will have voted 31 times to strip patients of basic protections. 
They will have voted 31 times to reverse the progress made by the 
Affordable Care Act, including protecting up to 17 million children who 
now have coverage even if they have preexisting conditions. In fact, 
the 31st vote that we will take is nothing more than a reaction to 
Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion that the law is constitutional. Yet 
the GOP continues to dispute this. Let's move on.
  If they were serious, they would have presented us with a plan 31 
votes ago to help us fix any flaws that this law may have. So I plead 
for the 31st time: let's get back to work.

LET'S NOT PLAY POLITICS WITH THE PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, on June 28 the United States Supreme 
Court ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was 
constitutional. It is now the law of the land, thanks in most part to 
Republican-appointed Chief Justice Roberts.
  Tomorrow, this House is expected to vote on the repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act. Vote again--remember H.R. 2 on January 19 and now 
H.R. 6079. It is, unfortunately, expected that, due to the Republican 
vote, that it will be repealed again.
  How sad, Madam Speaker. How can you face the seniors, the students, 
the women and children and small businesses with this level of 
uncertainty by trying to repeal it again? They are the primary 
beneficiaries.
  Can you explain why? Can you especially explain how this is going to 
add to the deficit? The CBO says so. $100 billion in 10 years, and $1 
trillion in 20 years.
  Madam Speaker, let's not play politics with one of the most important 
pieces of legislation that we have passed.

        HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I stood here 2 days ago addressing the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and reviewing its benefits. 
I stand here today after the landmark Supreme Court decision to make 
people aware of the Republicans' efforts to repeal this historic piece 
of legislation.
  The stakeholders must remember: seniors, the benefits with the 
prescription drugs already benefiting with $3.7 billion in savings; 
young adults who stay on their parents' plan until the age of 26, 6.6 
million of you; small businesses who will experience tax credits of up 
to 50 percent by the year 2014; and women, women who suffered 
discrimination in premiums and on preexisting conditions like 
pregnancy. Imagine being defined a preexisting condition. 2014 they 
will stop.
  These are just highlights, and this is why we need to, again, focus 
behind the Affordable Care Act and remember, it's the largest part of 
our GDP that keeps growing; and we need to have it under control in

                      AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DECISION

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, as a former judge of the North Carolina 
State Supreme Court, I've come to the well today to applaud the United 
States Supreme Court for its courage and for ruling on the side of 
constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. This is a win, Mr. 
Speaker, for 48 million Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, who 
will receive stable, secure, and affordable health coverage forever.
  I believe that much of the public confusion surrounding the bill was 
because Americans outside of the Washington Beltway simply did not 
understand what the Affordable Care Act means for them. So to put it 
plainly, Americans can now enjoy coverage without worry or jeopardy, 
regardless of preexisting conditions. Uninsured young people up to age 
26 will be able to receive coverage. If you become gravely ill, there 
are no limits on your benefits. If you are a woman, you can't be 
charged higher premiums. If you need preventive care, you won't have a 
copay or deductible. If you lose your job, you won't lose your 
coverage. And if your employer doesn't provide coverage, you will be 
able to buy it at affordable prices.
  The political theater Republicans orchestrated around health care is 
over. Congress debated, the Court decided. This is done.

            RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, tomorrow the United States Supreme Court 
is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care 
Act.
  Let us all step back and recognize those portions that people like. 
These are the highlights: For seniors, it closes the infamous doughnut 
hole for prescription drugs. This means, to date, about 5.3 million 
seniors have experienced savings of $3.7 billion. That doughnut hole 
will close completely by the year 2020.
  For women, we no longer are going to suffer the discrimination 
against us. Ninety percent of the plans today charge more for women 
than they do for men for the same process. In 2014, this stops. Women 
can no longer be discriminated against for what they call preexisting 
conditions. Do you know what these preexisting conditions are? Breast 
cancer, C-section and childbirth, pregnancy, victims of domestic abuse.
  And there will be a ban on maximum coverage in your lifetime for 
medical care. You will no longer need to have a referral to go see an 
OB/GYN. Children will also benefit.
  Madam Speaker, let's all recognize the value of the Affordable Care 
Act.

               WOMEN'S HEALTH AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, among the many beneficial reforms for 
women in the Affordable Care Act passed 2 years ago this week is an end 
to the discriminatory practice of gender rating in which individual 
women are charged more than men for the same coverage. We know for a 
fact that these sorts of discriminatory policies are not something that 
insurers would just change on their own.
  According to a report that the National Women's Law Center released 
earlier this week, over 90 percent of the best-selling plans in States 
that have not already banned gender rating still charge women more than 
men for the very same coverage. This costs women and their families 
approximately $1 billion a year. Because we fought--and we fought hard 
2 years ago--gender rating will be a thing of the past in 2014. At long 
last, a woman's health will be put on equal footing with that of her 
spouse, her son, or her brother.
  This is just one of the many benefits for women in the Affordable 
Care Act. I could not be more proud to have helped pass this piece of 
legislation, which will transform women's health in this country.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. PINGREE of Maine asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PINGREE of Maine. Madam Speaker, in the 2 years since its 
enactment, the Affordable Care Act has truly improved health care for 
families in Maine:
  It has given 190,000 seniors access to free preventative care and 
saved them over $5 million in prescription drug costs; it has allowed 
7,000 young adults to stay on their parents' insurance; and, in Maine, 
it has helped 1,300 small businesses provide their employees with 
health coverage.
  More critical benefits are on the way, including banning insurance 
companies from charging women more simply because of their gender.
  Yet here we are again, debating how to undo these successes, debating 
how to block women's access to contraceptives, and, this week, 
considering proposals to dismantle Medicare and shift the cost back to 
seniors.
  This must stop. We can't afford to go back to the status quo--denying 
women equal access to care, or telling seniors they're on their own, or 
letting families go bankrupt just because someone got sick.
  We must let the Affordable Care Act stand so more Americans have the 
chance to reap the benefits of true health care reform.

               THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S IMPACT ON WOMEN

  (Ms. FUDGE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, the National Women's Law Center recently 
reported that 90 percent of the best selling health plans charge women 
more than men for the same coverage. In addition, insurers have 
classified millions of women as having preexisting conditions because 
of a previous cesarean section or having been pregnant, even for being 
a victim of domestic violence.
  For decades, women have unfairly been charged excessive costs for 
their health care. Well, that changes now. Because of the Affordable 
Care Act, the discriminatory practice known as ``gender rating,'' or 
charging women more than men for care, will be prohibited starting in 
2014; and women in private plans can obtain free lifesaving procedures, 
such as mammograms and colonoscopies.
  The Affordable Care Act bans insurance companies from imposing 
lifetime limits on care, so Americans will not go bankrupt simply 
because they are trying to be healthy.
  And in 2014, because of health care reform, women cannot be denied 
access because of a preexisting condition.
  There is no better time than today to stand up and demand quality, 
accessible health care for women.

                REJECTING REPEAL OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my 
constituent, David Zoltan-Breiger, 33 years old, who now has coverage 
under Illinois' Pre-Existing Condition Plan thanks to the Affordable 
Care Act.
  David has diabetes. Because of his preexisting condition, he couldn't 
get insurance for over 2 years after losing his job. David is 
absolutely elated that he no longer has to wait for hours in the 
emergency room to get lifesaving insulin. Without coverage, the ER was 
his only option. Instead, he now has regular visits with the doctor and 
can avoid the medical crises that had become a frequent nightmare.
  What happens to David under repeal of the bill? He, like so many 
others, would lose coverage and once again be at the mercy of insurance 
companies.
  We cannot go back. We must reject the Republican call for repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act.

                   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORY

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I have risen before to talk about the fact 
that the congressional district that I represent has the highest 
uninsured rate out of any congressional district in the entire country.
  About 40 percent of the constituents that I represent don't have 
health care insurance, and I wanted to talk today about how the 
Affordable Care Act is already helping many of those constituents in 
the very district that I represent.
  Yesterday, I found out that a constituent who resides in the district 
I represent, Jason Roberts, had suffered from cancer and that he had 
been running out of options, but when the Affordable Care Act kicked 
in, he found out that his COBRA benefits would be saved.
  Because of the options offered through the Affordable Care Act, 
Jason, who, again, had suffered from cancer, he actually dropped his 
monthly premiums by $251 and his deductible by $1,500. That is an 
overall savings of about $4,500 a year for what Jason describes as 
``great coverage.''
  The simple fact that he and so many others are actually able to keep 
their insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition like Jason 
had with cancer, is a true testament to the benefits of the health care 
law.
  Let's work together to make sure that this health care law works for 
all of the uninsured like Jason and that it continues to work for all 
Americans.

  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I want to share a letter I received from a 
constituent of mine named Mary Ann from Milford, Connecticut. She is 
suffering from cancer, and she wrote to me during the recent Republican 
government shutdown. She wrote:

       I'm attaching a picture I snapped of the statement I 
     received from my insurance company regarding my chemotherapy 
     treatment of the month of July, which was one treatment.

  Over $110,000.

       I'm grateful I have insurance right now, but it's COBRA. It 
     is expensive, and it runs out in 18 months. If the Affordable 
     Care Act is not in place in 18 months, I will never be able 
     to get insurance or treatment.
       This is real for me. It is life or death for me, and I am 
     grateful that President Obama is not willing to negotiate 
     with my life as this Nation is held hostage by political 
     terrorists.

  Mr. Speaker, I receive calls and letters like this every single week. 
The Affordable Care Act is already making a profound difference for 
individuals and their families. Those on the other side of the aisle 
who talk about it is not necessary, they have health insurance. They 
have it.
  Why is it that this body goes on to say ``no'' to health insurance 
for millions of Americans who are out there? This body needs to stop 
partisan political games and let the Affordable Care Act work for 
families. It is a matter of life or death.

               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the signing of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act was historic. In addition to providing coverage and 
lowering health insurance costs for millions of Americans, the 
legislation will truly transform how care is delivered in the United 
States. As part of this new law, we are improving Medicare for the 
seniors and people with disabilities who depend on the program, 
extending the solvency of the program, and closing the prescription 
drug doughnut hole.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act creates the 
Independent Payment Advisory Board, IPAB. The Finance Committee, led by 
Chairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller, devised the board to provide 
reason and expertise to Medicare payment policy. Experts have concluded 
that the board will in fact bend the cost curve, achieving key goals of 
health reform: lowering costs overall and increasing Medicare's 
longevity.
  Built into the IPAB are protections for beneficiaries from limits on 
care and increased costs. The Senate will ensure that the new board 
operates in a transparent way with input from patients, providers, and 
experts to guarantee the best outcomes and continued access to care. 
Moreover, we in the Senate will oversee Medicare and the IPAB to 
protect the seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare is one of 
our most treasured programs, and the IPAB will only improve the program 
for beneficiaries in the future.

  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, after two years battling in the courts I 
am proud to announce today that the Supreme Court has upheld the 
Affordable Care Act. This has been a long and difficult fight, but I 
can say without a doubt it has been worth it.
  This landmark ruling will allow millions of Americans to rest easy, 
knowing that they will not be driven into debt from medical bills if 
they get sick. Children will no longer be denied possibly life saving 
healthcare because of

[[Page E1180]]

pre-existing conditions, and millions of young Americans will be able 
to stay on their parent's healthcare plans until they are 26.
  The function of government is to make life better for all Americans, 
regardless of socioeconomic background. The Affordable Care Act will 
improve the quality of life for working families, children and seniors. 
It will also strengthen our economy.
  President Obama is to be congratulated for his indispensable 
leadership in achieving the goal of affordable quality healthcare for 
all Americans, a goal we Democrats have been fighting for more than 75 
years.
  It is a fact of life that individuals do not have a choice in 
participating in the health care market. Eventually we will all get 
sick, and need medical attention. This bill requires every American to 
take control of their own coverage, and be responsible for themselves.
  I am proud to have voted in favor of this legislation two years ago, 
and prouder still to have stood on the steps of the Supreme Court today 
to celebrate the success of having the Affordable Care Act upheld. 
Today's ruling is a momentous occasion and a true victory for Americans 
across the nation.

  Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, on this two year ``check up'' of the 
Affordable Care Act, I'd like to share with you some real life examples 
of how this important legislation is helping Missourians not only stay 
healthier personally, but improve the health of their small businesses 
as well.
  Last week I took part in a workshop for small businesses, to help arm 
them with solid information on how the Act can help their bottom line. 
Lew Prince is a co-owner of Vintage Vinyl, a St. Louis record store. 
It's a landmark. He's been in business for some 30 years and he's 
always provided health insurance for his employees. BUT, he said for 
the first time EVER, his health care costs went down, went DOWN to the 
tune of 25 percent. With the money he saved, he was actually able to 
give out a few raises, and he's hired a couple of new people.
  The Act has also made a difference for the Wells Family. Sharon Wells 
and her husband Russell have dealt with inordinate expense for his 
medicine for Parkinson's disease for years. Thanks to the donut hole 
coverage provided in the Affordable Care Act, Sharon tells me they have 
more money in the household budget now for groceries and gas, maybe 
even a movie from time to time.
  Even though these are just two small examples, they contribute to the 
overall ripple effect of the profound difference this law is making in 
real people's lives all over the country. In closing, when it comes to 
helping Americans be more healthy, the Affordable Care Act is precisely 
what Americans needed. Let's not do anything to interrupt this healthy 
course of action.

SELECT COMMITTEE NEEDS TO PUT PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, every household in America knows this: The 
easiest money to save is money you haven't yet spent. That seems like 
common sense.

[[Page H5942]]

  We could reduce the deficit by eliminating spending that is to begin 
in the future, spending Americans simply cannot afford. This new select 
committee could easily achieve almost their entire target of reducing 
the Nation's deficit, and, most surprisingly, almost every dollar would 
come from benefits that do not yet exist.
  New mandates in the Affordable Care Act give the Federal Government 
far too much control, and taxpayers far too much responsibility, for 
financing health care in this country. Given our deteriorating debt, 
the simple truth is we simply cannot afford this new spending.
  The select committee will look to strengthen existing entitlement 
programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--but also these 
existing entitlements are on the table. So why shouldn't new 
entitlements created by the Affordable Care Act be as well?
  We have this choice moving forward: We can make the select committee 
negotiations as painful as possible or we can have a logical discussion 
about cutting back on spending that we simply cannot afford.
  The select committee is getting to work, and I encourage both 
parties, all 12 members, to put the Affordable Care Act on the table 
alongside other entitlements in need of reform. Failure to stop will 
simply threaten the very fabric of our Republic.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are here once 
again talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act, a bill that 
passed almost 2 years ago and that, as we all know, was recently upheld 
by the United States Supreme Court. We should be focusing on jobs and 
the economy. The repeal bill we are about to vote on isn't going to go 
anywhere, and we all know that. It won't pass the Senate, and it won't 
be signed into law. We could be doing real things to help Americans and 
the economy right now. Yet here we are, for the 31st time, voting on 
the same thing. So, instead of repeal, let's talk about the benefits to 
Americans as the Affordable Care Act is implemented.
  Because it will result in more people having access to health care, 
the Affordable Care Act will change the lives of millions of people. It 
will prevent more of the heart-wrenching stories like those we all hear 
about with regard to the consequences of a lack of access to health 
care. I know someone whose life would have been changed by the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Bob, in Oregon, lost his job. Because he lost his job, he lost his 
health insurance, so he got on to COBRA. He had that expensive option 
for a while, and at least it gave him coverage, but then his COBRA ran 
out for him, just as it does for so many other people, and he was 
forced to live without health insurance. It was quite a risk that he 
had to take, and it didn't work out so well for him. Like many people 
without insurance, he had medical troubles, but he put off treatment, 
hoping for the best. In the end, though, he ended up in the emergency 
room, which is exactly what the Affordable Care Act is designed to 
prevent. He had surgery, and was then in the hospital for almost a 
month. Because of the sky-high medical bills, he almost lost his home.
  Fortunately, he is doing okay today, but it was a very close call. 
This would not have happened under the Affordable Care Act, and it will 
not happen under the Affordable Care Act. Bob would have had access to 
affordable health care coverage, and he would not have put off 
preventative care, which is covered under the Affordable Care Act. He 
would have seen his doctor at the first sign of a problem, and he would 
not have ended up in the emergency room, which raises health care costs 
for everyone--a cost shift that the Affordable Care Act is designed to 
prevent--and he would not have come so close to losing his home.
  The benefits of the Affordable Care Act are undeniable: Already in my 
home State of Oregon, 43,000 young people have taken advantage of the 
opportunity to stay on their parents' health plans; children can't be 
denied insurance because of preexisting conditions; and 54 million 
Americans now receive free preventative care, and that's just after 2 
years.
  There are more and more benefits that will be implemented over the 
next several years: Insurers will no longer be able to discriminate 
against women; insurance marketplaces, called ``exchanges,'' will be 
created to make sure that everyone has access to affordable health 
insurance options; and starting just next month, women will have access 
to free preventative health care and contraception. All of these will 
be put into place, and as they are, more people will see how the 
Affordable Care Act positively affects their health and their wallets.
  Repealing the Affordable Care Act has no benefits. In fact, doing so 
would take away every single benefit I just mentioned and more. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal would increase 
the deficit--increase the deficit--by $210 billion over the next 10 
years. We can all agree that such an increase is unacceptable and 
fiscally irresponsible. So this will mark the 31st time that the House 
has voted on some form of repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I hope 
it's the last so that we can focus more on the things that really 
matter.

            OPPOSITION TO REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, this is day 2 of the misguided 
Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We have been down 
this road 31 times with the same arguments and the same often 
misleading rhetoric that does not reflect the true benefits of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Those who argue against it are not speaking for my 167,000 uninsured 
constituents who for the first time will receive health insurance 
coverage when the law is fully implemented. They are not speaking for 
the 7,000 young adults who can now stay on their parents' insurance 
plans until they are aged 26, or for the 510 small businesses in my 
district that are receiving tax credits to help maintain or expand 
health care coverage for their employees.
  Colleagues who support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act are also 
disregarding the needs of minority communities in which millions suffer 
from persistent and life-shortening health disparities. In my largely 
Latino district, for example, thousands more of my constituents will 
have access to health care through the expansion of Medicaid, the 
creation of health insurance exchanges, and through the law's expansion 
of community health centers.
  Mr. Speaker, my constituents do not want the Affordable Care Act 
repealed nor do the millions of Americans across our country for which 
the ACA has brought lifesaving benefits. This is most certainly true 
for women, seniors and people with disabilities.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, being female can no longer be 
considered a preexisting condition. Women will no longer have to pay 
higher premiums than men, and prenatal care will finally be covered for 
all women in this country.
  Never again will our sisters, mothers and daughters have to choose 
between a mammogram or putting food on the table because these 
lifesaving preventative health services will no longer require 
copayments.
  As for seniors, last year, as a result of health reform, over 32 
million of them received free preventative health services, and over 5 
million seniors are saving close to $4 billion on Medicare prescription 
drug costs as the doughnut hole closes.
  Because Obama cares, our families and neighbors with disabilities 
will no longer live in fear of reaching lifetime limits on their 
insurance or of being excluded from coverage due to having preexisting 
conditions.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is already working for my 
constituents--for women, for minority communities, for seniors, and for 
people with disabilities. It is time for my Republican colleagues to 
listen to these Americans who do not want to lose their new health 
benefits. The Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act. Let's 
stop wasting time and taxpayers' money and find solutions to the other 
complex issues facing our country today.

                    SUPPORT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Richardson) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the latest 
Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to block 
meaningful health care reform. The Affordable Care Act has been upheld 
by the highest court, the United States Supreme Court, who found that 
this legislation was constitutional.
  I rise today to stress my support of the Affordable Care Act and my 
opposition to the legislation brought before us today.
  This legislation addresses the Affordable Health Care Act, millions 
of uninsured Americans, and it strengthens the Medicare system. It 
relieves all Americans of the growing financial burden and medical 
costs of insurance that many find tough to bear.
  Let me talk a little bit about my district in California. In the 37th 
Congressional District, the benefits of this bill are already 
undisputable. There are now 23,000 children and 90,000 adults who have 
health care insurance that covers preventive services with no copays, 
co-insurance, or deductible. There will be 501 small businesses that 
will receive tax credits that will help them maintain or expand their 
health care coverage for their employees. Health care providers in my 
district have received $3.4 million in affordable care grants since 
2010 to support community health centers, to develop innovative and 
cost-saving health care delivery systems, and to train new health care 
professionals. These statistics are not unique to my district. There 
are similar success stories emerging all over the country.
  Let me speak a little bit about some of those general things that are 
happening. If you're a senior, based upon the Affordable Care Act now, 
you are receiving a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs when you 
are in Medicare and you experience the doughnut hole coverage gap. You 
have free key preventive services such as mammograms, colonoscopies, 
and a free annual well-visit with your physician. If you're a woman, 
you now have free coverage of lifesaving preventive services such as 
mammograms. Beginning in August, free coverage will also include 
additional comprehensive women-preventive services, including breast 
feeding support, contraception, and domestic violence screening.
  If you're a parent and you have a child who is under the age of 19, 
they can't be denied coverage by an insurance company because of a 
preexisting condition. If you're an adult, you can now join or stay on 
your parents' health plan until you're 26 years old. Those are for our 
young adults. If you're a small business owner, you will be one of the 
millions who will be eligible as a small business owner to receive tax 
credits if you choose to offer coverage to your employees.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act was a long-overdue bill that 
corrects deep injustices and access to health care. The Affordable Care 
Act should be an act that is respected and upheld by this House. It has 
gone through the proper channels of legislation and now has been 
validated by the United States Supreme Court.
  Mr. Speaker, all Americans--young, old, rich, and poor--have an 
inalienable right to health care and to be able to prosper. To be able 
to prosper, you need to be healthy.
  I ask my colleagues to support the Affordable Care Act and to join me 
in fierce opposition to repealing the advances in health care that we 
already won. When we look forward, we must focus on implementing the 
affordable health care bill and focus on getting Americans back to 
work.

 THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT: KEEPING SENIORS HEALTHY AND REDUCING HEALTH 
                               CARE COSTS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) is 
recognized for 38 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I don't plan to use the entire time, but I 
come to the floor this evening basically to talk about the Affordable 
Care Act. Some call it the health care reform.
  This Friday will be the second anniversary of the President's signing 
of the Affordable Care Act, or health care reform, and I'd like to talk 
a little bit about how it's helping so many people with patient 
protections and added benefits, whether you're talking about seniors or 
young people or women or just the general public.
  The main thing that is heralded, if you will, by the Affordable Care 
Act is the opportunity over the next few years to expand health 
insurance to so many Americans who do not have health insurance now. We 
estimate there are variously between 40, maybe 45 million Americans 
that simply have no health insurance; and what that means is they 
either don't go to a doctor or they don't get any kind of health care 
unless they get very sick and end up going to the emergency room. The 
consequences of that is that they take no preventative care. They end 
up in the emergency room. Oftentimes, they can't afford to pay the cost 
of the emergency room, and that cost simply gets passed on to the 
hospital or, ultimately, to everyone else who is paying for health 
insurance.
  So basically, what the Affordable Care Act does over the next few 
years is try to expand insurance coverage to something like 98, 99 
percent of all Americans, taking up those 45 million people and, for 
the most part, making sure that they have health insurance. It does 
that in two basic ways:
  First of all, it expands Medicaid, which is the health insurance 
program for people below a certain income. About 15 million Americans 
who have no health insurance now would be eligible for Medicaid under 
the Affordable Care Act over the next few years when it kicks in.
  In addition to that, for the rest of the Americans who have no health 
insurance, most of them are people that either don't get it on their 
job, they're not eligible, or they're not offered health insurance by 
their employer, or they may be individuals who are employed on their 
own or at home or not employed in some capacity. They have a very hard 
time buying a health insurance policy on what we call the individual 
market. So what the Affordable Care Act does, it sets up exchanges in 
every State, or throughout the country, where you can get a very good 
package for a reasonable price, a very low-cost price, and, at the same 
time, it provides a subsidy through tax credits to many Americans, 
depending upon their income.
  We estimate for a family of four making up to $70,000 or $80,000 a 
year would be eligible for some sort of subsidy or tax credit that 
would make their health insurance policy more affordable. So 
essentially, what we do is, between expansion of Medicaid and the 
subsidies, if you will, and the low-cost insurances offered now on 
these exchanges around the country, most people would end up with 
health insurance.
  Now, what I wanted to talk about today are some of the benefits, if 
you will, that have already kicked in for various groups of people, 
particularly seniors. I wanted to start with seniors because many 
seniors, as you know, because they're on a fixed income, have a hard 
time making ends meet. Oftentimes, they can't afford their rent, they 
can't afford food, and for them to take extra money out of pocket to 
pay for health care costs is oftentimes very difficult, and they have 
to make choices between heat or food as opposed to health care.
  One of the things that I really want to stress today, because I 
listened in the last few nights, because of the anniversary of the 
Affordable Care Act coming up on Friday, I've heard some of my 
colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle actually suggest that 
somehow the Affordable Care Act was going to negatively impact 
Medicare. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the 
Affordable Care Act expands benefits for seniors under Medicare in many 
significant ways.
  But it's particularly interesting that I hear that from the other 
side of the aisle, from the Republican side of the aisle this week 
because, on Tuesday, the Republicans unveiled their budget for the next 
fiscal year.

                              {time}  2050

  Once again as they did last year in last year's budget, the 
Republican budget this year essentially gets rid of Medicare, or what I 
would say ends traditional Medicare. So it's kind of strange to hear 
the Republicans talk about Medicare and the Affordable Care Act since 
the Affordable Care Act actually expands benefits for seniors under 
Medicare, whereas they unveiled their budget this week that actually 
abolishes, for all practical purposes, Medicare as we know it.
  What the Republican budget does, once again, is say to seniors, Well, 
we're going to give you a voucher. We're going to give you a certain 
amount of money through a voucher, if you will, and you can take that 
and go out and buy private insurance instead of getting the guaranteed 
benefit under Medicare that seniors now have.
  The problem with a voucher is that it's a fixed amount of money, and 
it's not all clear that seniors can buy health insurance with a 
voucher. But even if they could, because it's a fixed amount of money 
and it doesn't increase significantly over the years, what you'll find 
with that voucher is that more and more seniors would have to pay out 
of pocket either to purchase the insurance because the voucher is not 
enough or because they probably can't get a decent package equivalent 
to the Medicare guarantee, and therefore would have to pay out of 
pocket for certain costs that are not covered by the health care plan 
that they purchased with the voucher.
  So it's sort of ironic to hear the Republicans talk about the 
Affordable Care Act and suggest that the Affordable Care Act should be 
repealed because of its impact on Medicare when in fact they're doing 
their best under the budget to basically end Medicare as we know it.
  Let me talk a little bit about some of the benefits.
  I want to talk about how the Affordable Care Act helps seniors, and 
then a little bit about how it helps women, and then a little bit about 
how it helps young people.
  Of course, it helps everybody by simply expanding health care 
coverage for those who don't have health insurance.
  But the benefits, in particular, I want to talk about and start with 
seniors.
  I mentioned before that no group has been hit harder by soaring 
health care costs than seniors. With the economy struggling over the 
last several years, seniors have suffered even more as they've watched 
many of their pensions and investments dwindle, making

[[Page H1491]]

the cost of addressing their health care needs even more challenging.
  Now, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, some of the financial 
burdens plaguing seniors trying to manage their health care needs have 
been alleviated.
  For example, all Medicare beneficiaries now have access to 
preventative care and services without any copay, coinsurance, or 
deductible. Many times you will find that seniors won't even access 
health care because of the copay, which is about 20 percent in most 
cases.
  So now services like annual wellness visits, cholesterol and other 
cardiovascular screenings, mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, 
prostate cancer screenings are completely free of charge to seniors. No 
copay. The fact of the matter is that the Affordable Care Act expands 
benefits for seniors, makes it so seniors pay less.
  More than 32.5 million seniors nationwide have received one or more 
free preventative services, and 2.3 million seniors have already 
received a free annual wellness visit to their doctor, which again is a 
critical step in preventing a more serious illness because if the 
senior citizen goes for the annual checkup or has some of these 
preventative services free of charge, then that avoids them having to 
get sicker, ending up in a nursing home or ending up in a hospital.
  The most important thing, though, in terms of expansion of benefits 
under the Affordable Care Act for seniors is the closing of the 
Medicare part D doughnut hole.
  Seniors before the Affordable Care Act would run out of their part D 
benefits on the average by September of the year. In other words, if 
they spent more than $2,500 approximately on drugs, they wouldn't get 
any help under Medicare part D until they got to a higher catastrophic 
level of $5,000. So that was the doughnut hole, that gap when they 
weren't getting any money to help pay for their prescription drugs.
  What the Affordable Care Act does is it closes the Medicare part D 
doughnut hole and provides a 50 percent discount on brand name drugs. 
3.6 million seniors have already received the discount, saving a total 
of $2.1 billion, with each senior saving an average of $604.
  Now, by 2020 that doughnut hole is closed completely. Now it's a 50 
percent discount, but gradually that will close by 2020 when all their 
drugs are covered and the doughnut hole ceases to exist.
  I also want to stress that the Affordable Care Act has cracked down 
on fraud in Medicare. In fiscal year 2011, a joint anti-Medicare fraud 
task force of the Health and Human Services Department, Department of 
Justice, recovered more than $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare 
payments on behalf of taxpayers.
  A lot of times, my senior citizens will say to me well, there's a lot 
of fraud in Medicare. There is. But the Affordable Care Act has 
significantly cracked down on a lot of that fraud, $4.1 billion in 
fiscal year 2011.
  Now, I mention this again by way of contrast. Here we are in the 
Affordable Care Act expanding benefits, making it so seniors don't have 
to pay more, and what are the Republicans doing with their budget? They 
have a budget that basically says we'll give you a voucher. You go out 
and buy your health insurance. If you can't afford it, you have to pay 
the difference. The basic guarantee of Medicare and a good benefit 
package simply won't be there, and seniors will just end up paying more 
out of pocket.
  Now, I wanted to talk a little bit about how the Affordable Care Act 
levels the field for women's health care because we know that 
traditionally in health care there has been a huge gender gap.
  A report issued this week from the National Women's Law Center shows 
that more than 90 percent of the best selling health plans still charge 
women more than men for the same coverage just because women use more 
health services. The health care law, the Affordable Care Act, will 
prohibit this discriminatory practice, which we call gender rating, 
beginning in 2014. So that when the Affordable Care Act fully kicks in, 
this gender gap will simply disappear.

  Now, you might say to yourself, well, how is that possible? It's 
mainly because insurers have considered millions of women as having 
what we call preexisting conditions. In other words, they were denied 
coverage or they were charged more for having had breast cancers, 
Cesarean-section childbirth, having even been pregnant. Some policies 
would charge women more because they were pregnant or consider that a 
preexisting condition. Or for being victims of domestic abuse, for 
example.
  So denying women insurance on these grounds is unconscionable, and 
thanks to the Affordable Care Act, beginning in 2014, women will no 
longer be denied coverage by any insurers based on these preexisting 
conditions, and they can't be charged more because of the preexisting 
conditions.
  Now, we've seen again by contrast, what have the Republicans been 
doing? They say repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would let these 
preexisting conditions and this gender gap continue. But beyond that, 
over the last year or so, we've seen the Republicans essentially 
declare war on women, and I just want to give you an example.
  One of the ones that has received the most attention lately are these 
attempts by the Republicans to block access to contraception. I don't 
know how far they're going to go in terms of denying women coverage, 
but that's one of the things that we've seen in the headlines for the 
last few months or so.
  Let me give you some other examples under the Affordable Care Act. 
Insurance companies are now prohibited from requiring women to obtain a 
pre-authorization or referral for access to OB GYN care. Health care 
reform also requires insurance plans to cover important preventative 
services, including critical immunizations, numerous health screenings, 
and counseling services, with no cash cost-sharing by women.
  Women in new private plans under the Affordable Care Act, they 
provide free coverage of important lifesaving preventative services.
  But the other thing that would often happen is that many health 
insurance plans have what they call lifetime dollar limits on health 
benefits so that if a woman--this would be true for anyone if they have 
that lifetime dollar limit in it--but oftentimes it was applied to 
women in particular; that if you spent a certain amount of money on 
your health care over your lifetime, that was it. You didn't get any 
more coverage under your plan. So that is also prohibited under the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Now, I just mentioned those few things that apply to women because 
there really continues to exist a gender gap but that will be closed 
and eliminated under the Affordable Care Act when it completely kicks 
in.
  Now, the last group I wanted to mention just because I always felt 
that many times in Congress we don't pay a lot of attention to kids, 
and I felt that it's very important for us to recognize the fact that 
policies and the practices and the laws don't necessarily help 
children, and children are very vulnerable. It's like, the seniors are 
vulnerable, the children are vulnerable.
  One of the things that's significant about the Affordable Care Act, 
it really makes a difference for children in terms of keeping them 
healthy and also keeping them insured.

                              {time}  2100

  And a lot of times Americans have to make choices with regard to 
their kids about whether they can afford health care services because 
of the prohibitive cost of insuring children.
  Under the old system, before the Affordable Care Act, sick children 
were often denied health coverage if their parents were forced to 
change insurance because they either switched or lost their jobs. 
Insurance companies declined or dropped coverage for children when 
young adults got sick or had an accident. That's no longer the case. 
Under the Affordable Care Act, basically there is a prohibition on 
insurers denying coverage of children under age 19 for having a 
preexisting children.
  Up to 17 million children with preexisting conditions are now 
protected from that type of discrimination. Currently, there are 7.3 
million American children without any health insurance. Beginning in 
2014, the law will provide access to quality coverage. That's 
accomplished again by expanding Medicaid coverage and also by providing 
affordable insurance on these exchanges with a tax credit or some kind 
of help

[[Page H1492]]

from the Federal Government to pay for the insurance.
  The other thing I wanted to point out, though--and this is really 
significant because, again, it has kicked in and I've had many of my 
constituents come up to me and mention it--is that the Affordable Care 
Act requires health plans to allow parents to keep children under age 
26 without job-based coverage on their family's coverage and give 
millions of parents and young adults the peace of mind that they can 
start their lives and careers without being crippled by health care 
expenses.
  What happens is that because of the economy and the difficulties 
we've had with the economy over the last few years, a lot of kids or 
young adults, when they graduate high school, when they graduate 
college, are not able to find a job, or while they are in college they 
can't afford health insurance on their own because they have to go out 
and buy it on the individual market. What the Affordable Care Act says 
is you can be kept on your parents' policy and the insurance company 
has to provide that option up to the age of 26. That's very 
significant. Millions of young people that did not have coverage are 
now covered by that under their parents' policy.
  I just wanted to take a couple more minutes. I wanted to give some 
examples of the numbers of people in my district, the Sixth 
Congressional District in New Jersey, that have been impacted in a 
positive way by the Affordable Care Act.
  These statistics come from my committee that I serve on, the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce. And just to give you some idea, in my 
district, in the Sixth District of New Jersey:
  6,800 young adults in the district now have health insurance that 
didn't have it before;
  9,100 seniors in the district received prescription drug discounts 
worth $6.9 million, an average discount of $760 per senior. This is for 
their prescription drug coverage;
  There were 63,000 seniors in the Sixth District in New Jersey that 
received Medicare preventive services without paying any copays, 
coinsurance, or deductibles;
  31,000 children and 130,000 adults now have health insurance that 
covers preventive services without paying any copays, coinsurance, or 
deductibles;
  There are 620 small businesses in the Sixth District that received 
tax credits to help maintain or expand health insurance coverage for 
their employees;
  There have been $1.8 million in public health grants that have been 
given to community health centers, hospitals, doctors, and other health 
care providers to improve the community's health. Community health 
centers have really expanded in the district because of the Affordable 
Care Act; and
  There are 8,000 to 35,000 children with preexisting health conditions 
who can no longer be denied coverage by health insurers.
  I can give you more statistics, but I just want to point out that 
these benefits under the Affordable Care Act are impacting constituents 
in every district in the country, not just mine. Not only the thousands 
of people in my district, but all over the country, millions of people.
  I just wanted to talk a little bit about the cost issue, because I 
always hear the Republicans say, Oh, your costs are going to go up 
because of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, costs for health insurance 
now without the Affordable Care Act have gone up, but the Affordable 
Care Act actually is reducing costs for health insurance. Whatever cost 
increases that are being exhibited now are because the Affordable Care 
Act hasn't gone into effect completely. It kicks in gradually over the 
next few years.
  I also hear some of my Republican colleagues say, Oh, your health 
insurance went up. That's because it hasn't kicked in yet. Once it 
kicks in, there are a lot of positive impacts on costs that will make a 
difference.
  Let me just talk about some of the statistics in terms of costs that 
I think are significant.
  Since enactment of the health care law, the reform, the ACA, premiums 
are generally lower or stable. Average premiums for Medicare Advantage 
enrollees are 7 percent lower in 2012 than they were in 2011. Since the 
health care law was enacted, these premiums have fallen by 16 percent. 
Average premiums for Medicare part D, the prescription drug program, in 
2012, have seen no increase from the 2011 level. The Medicare part B 
deductible has fallen by $22 to $144 in 2012, the first time in 
Medicare history that the deductible has actually fallen. For most 
Medicare part B enrollees, the standard part B premium in 2012 is quite 
stable. It's 3.6 percent higher than the premium they paid in 2011, 
matching the 3.6 percent COLA increase seniors are receiving in their 
Social Security checks.
  The growth in private plan premiums has also slowed. In September 
2011, Mercer, an independent benefits consulting firm, released a 
survey of employers showing that health insurance premium increases 
will average 5.4 percent in 2012, the smallest increase measured since 
1997. Despite Republican claims, the health care law has played 
essentially no role in recent private plan premium increases. In fact, 
the premium increases have taken effect only because the ACA has not 
fully kicked in at this point.
  There are two provisions that I wanted to mention that deal with cost 
and that address cost in the Affordable Care Act that I think are 
significant and that put downward pressure on premiums.
  One is the rate review, and that is, under the health care law, there 
is a new transparency and accountability for insurers, with insurers 
being required to publicly justify on the Internet any premium 
increases they are seeking that are over 10 percent. And the Department 
of Health and Human Services has rate review authority to publicly deem 
these increases to be unreasonable, and they've done that in a number 
of States. The health care law also provides $250 million in health 
care insurance rate review grants to the States to make them enforce 
and keep premiums down.
  Finally, under the health care law, insurers must spend at least 80 
percent of premiums on medical care and quality improvement rather than 
CEO pay, profits, and administrative costs. If insurers don't meet 
these standards, they have to pay rebates to their consumers starting 
this summer. These are significant ways of cutting back on costs.
  What do we see from the other side of the aisle? Again, repeal the 
Affordable Care Act. If the Affordable Care Act were repealed, all the 
things that I talked about would disappear. Costs would climb. More and 
more people would have no insurance. All the benefits for seniors--the 
fact that you can have your children on the policy until 26, the gender 
gap for women, all these things, all the benefits would disappear and 
only the bad impacts from insurance companies being able to do whatever 
they want would remain.
  The Republicans talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act. They 
don't say what they would substitute for it. What we do know--and I'm 
going to close with this, Mr. Speaker--this week we heard from the 
Republicans in terms of what they want to do with their budget. Again, 
what does their budget do? It essentially privatizes Medicare. It makes 
it into a voucher program, causing seniors to spend more money out of 
pocket for the type of guaranteed benefits they receive now under 
Medicare. It even goes and impacts Medicaid.
  A lot of people are not aware of the fact that Medicaid, which most 
people see as a program for poor people, actually pays most of the 
costs for nursing home care in this country. What happens is that if 
you have to go to a nursing home, you have to spend all your assets 
essentially--with few exceptions--on paying for that nursing home care; 
and then after you have no assets left, the Medicaid kicks in and pays 
for your nursing home care.
  What do the Republicans do in their budget? They basically slash 
Medicaid. They block-grant it to the States. They slash it from 20 
percent to 30 percent based on different accounts. That's a 20 percent 
to 30 percent slash, and that money goes back to the States because the 
States have to match Medicaid. They also abolish the expansion of 
Medicaid, that I mentioned before, under the Affordable Care Act 
because they assume under the budget that the Affordable Care Act is 
going to be repealed.
  So not only is there a negative impact on Medicare because it becomes 
a voucher and essentially traditional Medicare disappears and seniors 
pay

[[Page H1493]]

more out of pocket, but with regard to Medicaid, which pays for nursing 
home care, the States are going to get so much less money that the 
quality of nursing home care will seriously diminish.

                              {time}  2110

  I remember back in the seventies when you would go to many nursing 
homes, and they were terrible places. Because we upgraded them and we 
provided money to the States to pay for Medicaid, which they matched, 
the quality of nursing homes improved significantly. Well, what 
happened--and I'm not just telling this. The nursing home industry has 
said this--with these types of cuts that are being proposed in the 
Republican budget, a lot of nursing homes will close, and their quality 
of care will diminish. They won't have as many nurses on staff. They 
won't be able to do a lot of the things they do now to make people's 
lives in nursing homes more comfortable.
  And the budget assumes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which 
means that the expansion of Medicaid, the subsidy to pay for health 
insurance, all the things that I have talked about before would simply 
disappear.
  So I know I make a stark contrast between what the Republicans are 
proposing and what we're doing with the Affordable Care Act and trying, 
on the Democratic side, to shore up and expand Medicare benefits. But 
the fact of the matter is that it is a stark contrast, a very stark 
contrast in terms of a world view of what we are going to do in terms 
of health insurance coverage and what we're going to do to protect 
seniors in Medicare. And I think it's very important for my colleagues 
to understand these differences as we proceed over the next few weeks.
  So I am very proud of the fact that on Friday, we will be celebrating 
the second anniversary of President Obama signing the Affordable Care 
Act. And I am also proud of the fact that, as a Democrat, we are going 
to oppose the Republican budget. When the Republican budget was 
proposed last year, it passed the House, but it didn't pass the Senate; 
and we heard nothing more about it.
  And that's exactly what we plan on doing this year because we can't 
allow Medicare to be destroyed. We can't allow the Medicare guarantee 
to disappear. We can't allow Medicare to basically wither on the vine, 
as former Speaker Gingrich said, as it's vouchered and as it's 
privatized, as the Republicans suggest in their budget.
  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2013

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that many of our 
colleagues across the aisle are hoping and betting that the Affordable 
Care Act will fail.
  But every day it becomes clearer that they are losing that bet and 
their hope for failure is not shared by the American people, 105 
million of whom already have received coverage for one or more free 
preventive health care services like screenings for breast cancer and 
diabetes.
  In my state of Texas, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 
5,198,00 individuals with private insurance who have received coverage 
for one or more free preventive services due to the Affordable Care 
Act.
  Children have received free vision and hearing screenings and 
recommended immunizations.
  Adults have received free immunizations and cancer screenings such as 
colonoscopies for cancer, cholesterol and high blood pressure 
screening; and HIV.
  Women have received preventive services such as recommended 
mammograms and Pap smears; screenings for gestational diabetes; and 
domestic violence counseling.
  Our Republican friends like to tell themselves that Obamacare is an 
unmitigated disaster. But to millions of Americans living in the real 
world, Obamacare is an unqualified success.


                       TEXAS--ACA SUCCESS STORIES

  Take Mark and Lucy for example,
  After comparing plans, Mark Sullivan, a new business owner, settled 
on a bronze option and added dental insurance. He will receive an $82 
per month subsidy, which will halve the monthly premium he will pay 
down to $78.
  Lucy is another Texan who is thankful for the Affordable Care Act, 
which is enabling her to save $2,300 a year on her premium and $4,000 
on her deductible.
  Lucy writes: ``I signed up at Healthcare.gov and I'm going to save 
$2,300 a year on my premium alone--and more, because my deductible will 
drop from $7,500 a year to $3,000 a year. It's still Blue Cross 
insurance, and I don't have to change doctors, either. I had a choice 
of over 30 plans and several different companies.''
  Mr. Speaker, my constituents in the i8th Congressional District of 
Texas favor the Affordable Care Act because they understand the 
insecurity and feeling of helplessness of being uninsured or 
underinsured. My home state of Texas has the highest percentage of 
uninsured, 27.6 percent in the nation, 4 percent more than Louisiana, 
the next state on the list.
  Mr. Speaker, health care coverage not only must be available and 
affordable but also adequate for consumers to have the health security 
and financial protection they need and deserve. The Affordable Care Act 
satisfies these criteria.
  Of course we should not be surprised by the House Republicans. After 
all, it is was the House Republicans who shut down the federal 
government for 16 days and cost the economy $24 billion while refusing 
to consider any legislation that would create jobs or address the real 
needs of the American people.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to reflect with my 
colleagues and say that we celebrate today the 1-year anniversary of 
the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and to reflect how much 
happened to improve health care in America since the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  We have reason to celebrate. If you are a senior in the Medicare 
Program, and you now know that you can see your primary care doctor 
every year for an annual wellness exam, and that wellness exam will now 
be covered under Medicare, and you will have an opportunity to meet 
with your doctor and take charge of your own health, you have a reason 
to celebrate passage of the Affordable Care Act.
  If you are a senior who happens to fall within the coverage gap under 
the prescription drug benefits in Medicare, the so-called doughnut 
hole, and you have been forced at times to leave prescriptions on the 
counter of a drugstore because you could not afford to pay the cost of 
the prescription, and you now know that there is coverage in Medicare 
if you fall within that gap--for last year, 3.2 million seniors who 
fell within the gap received a $250 check. This year, the seniors who 
fall within this coverage gap will receive a 50-percent discount on 
their brandname drugs. Next year, their benefit will be worth as much 
as $2,400 and, by 2020, we will close the gap entirely, all as a result 
of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. So you have reason to 
celebrate that Congress finally got the job done.
  If you are an American family, like many, and you celebrate your 
child's graduation from college, only to find that your child could no 
longer be covered under your health insurance policy because of the age 
restriction, and now you learn that Congress has changed that age to 
26, so you can keep your youngster under your family insurance program, 
and that child now has health insurance, and you are one of 1.2 million 
people who benefit from this provision that was in the Affordable Care 
Act, you have reason to celebrate the passage of the Affordable Care 
Act.
  If you are a small business owner who can now afford to cover your 
employees because of the small business tax credit that was included in 
the Affordable Care Act--4 million eligible institutions will be 
eligible for that tax credit, and soon you will be able to get 
competitive rates. Small businesses today pay 20 percent more for the 
same coverage large companies have. Congress took action last year to 
eliminate that disparity. If you are one of those small business owners 
now benefiting from that tax credit or who will benefit from more 
competitive rates and better choice, you have reason to celebrate the 
passage of the Affordable Care Act.
  If you happen to be a consumer of health insurance, as almost all of 
us are, and you want value for your premium dollar, you now know that 
with passage of the Affordable Care Act, the lion's share of your 
health premiums must go for health benefits, reining in the excessive 
administrative costs of private insurance companies, and you know now 
that Congress has taken action to prevent the abusive practices of 
private insurance companies, you have reason to celebrate the passage 
of the Affordable Care Act.
  If you happen to be the woman in Maryland, who was hiking in the 
mountains of West Virginia and fell off a cliff, was unconscious, and 
was flown to the closest emergency room to receive care and was denied 
coverage because she did not call ahead for preauthorization, you have 
a reason to celebrate the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.
  Yes, insurance companies have denied coverage for emergency care 
because of requirements for preauthorization or have denied coverage 
because the ultimate diagnosis did not meet their standard for 
reimbursement, even though your symptoms indicated you should seek 
emergency care. I started working on that issue in 1995, known as the 
prudent layperson's standards for requiring insurance companies to 
reimburse their policyholders for visits to emergency rooms, where 
their symptoms indicated they should go to the emergency room.
  In 1997, Medicare and Medicaid were changed in order to provide for 
the prudent layperson's standard for reimbursement. Now all insurance 
companies must comply with that standard because of the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  If you are a parent who has a child who has asthma or you have been 
told that the insurance company won't provide full coverage because of 
your child's preexisting condition, and now you can get full coverage 
for your child, you too have a reason to celebrate the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  If you are an adult and have been told you cannot get insurance 
because of a preexisting condition, such as high blood pressure, or you 
happen to be like a couple from Montgomery County, MD, who had to get 
two separate insurance policies because of preexisting conditions, 
paying two separate premiums and two separate deductibles, and now you 
know you can get one insurance plan that will cover your family, you 
have a reason to celebrate, because that too was corrected by the 
Affordable Care Act that was passed by Congress 1 year ago.
  If you happen to be a taxpayer who is concerned about the fiscal 
soundness of Medicare or the budget deficit, you too have a reason to 
celebrate enactment of the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable 
Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare system by 12 years, 
putting it on a safer basis, making it less vulnerable for our budget.
  The enactment of the Affordable Care Act reduced the Federal budget 
deficit by over $100 billion during the first 10 years, and over $1.5 
trillion during the first 20 years. This is because, quite frankly, 
this bill manages illness much more cost effectively. It uses health 
information technology more effectively and it invests in wellness, and 
it brings down the cost. That is not what this

[[Page S1711]]

Senator is saying has been established; it is what the CBO has told us 
will bring in savings on our budget deficit. Taxpayers have a reason to 
celebrate the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.

  There is one other reason to celebrate the year's anniversary of the 
enactment of this legislation. Let me give one more example. A couple 
of weeks ago I was at the Greater Baden Health Center located about 7 
or 8 miles from where we are today. They are doing something about the 
infant mortality rate in our community. We have too high of an infant 
mortality rate because of low birth weight babies. Some do not survive 
and become part of our infant mortality numbers in America where we are 
much higher than we should be. Others survive and have complications 
that need to be addressed by our health care system, making it 
challenging for the infant and expensive for our society.
  At the Greater Baden Health Center, they are doing something about 
that situation. They are expanding their qualified health center to 
include prenatal care so pregnant women can get the type of attention 
they need to have healthy babies. That money comes from the Affordable 
Care Act because of the expansion of our qualified health centers.
  We all celebrate what we are able to accomplish. It will keep our 
children healthier and save us money and have less use of the emergency 
rooms by expanding care at our qualified centers.
  Madam President, if you are concerned about health disparities in 
America--and you have reason to be--minorities are two times more 
likely to suffer from diabetes and 33 percent more likely to die from 
heart disease. In the African-American community, the infant mortality 
rate is 2.3 times higher than the White community. When we look at the 
number of people who have access to health care and health insurance, 
the minority population represents one-third. Yet they are one-half of 
the people who do not have health insurance.
  I think we all agree that we need to do something about that 
situation. That is not right in our sense of fairness. But let me give 
one more reason it will save us money.
  A study done at Johns Hopkins University and the University of 
Maryland points out that we can save $260 billion in excess direct 
medical care costs if we can deal with the minority health disparities. 
We had done something about that in the Affordable Care Act. An 
amendment that I was proud to offer established the Institute for 
Minority Health and Health Disparities within the National Institutes 
of Health. We have developed minority health and disparity offices in 
each of our agencies that deal with health care to do something about 
health disparities in America. We can all celebrate that we are able to 
move that forward in the Affordable Care Act.
  We should all take pride that America at long last, after decades of 
unsuccessful attempts, has acted. Health care is a right, not a 
privilege. As our dear friend, the late Senator Kennedy, said: We no 
longer have a sick care system. We have taken action to include all 
under health care in America.
  I understand the Republicans in the House want to repeal each and 
every one of these improvements and accomplishments. They offer no hope 
of taking up these issues in a serious manner during this Congress. 
Speaking on behalf of our seniors, speaking on behalf of our small 
business owners, speaking on behalf of the consumers of health 
insurance in America, speaking on behalf of what is right, as far as 
covering and making sure everyone has access to affordable care, we do 
not want to see that happen. We do not want to move backwards. We have 
reason to celebrate the accomplishments of moving forward with health 
care. We want to move forward, not back, and continue to build on an 
American health care system that provides affordable quality care to 
all Americans.
  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, opponents of the Affordable Care Act in 
Congress have spent the past few weeks reveling in the problems of the 
Federal exchange Web site, healthcare.gov.
  In my State of Kentucky, where we have created our own exchange, we 
have had tremendous success. As of last week, nearly 415,000 people had 
explored the Web site and assessed their options. More than 42,000 are 
now enrolled in health plans, many of them for the first time; and 843 
small businesses have begun applying for coverage for their employees, 
with 309 of them already able to offer coverage to their workers.
  We are 6 weeks into a 6-month open enrollment period, and while the 
failures of the Federal health care Web site are frustrating, they are 
far from fatal. The true danger to the more than 42,000 Kentuckians who 
have gained coverage under the law--and the hundreds of thousands more 
who will--is what opponents of the law are proposing in its place: a 
return to the broken system that failed tens of millions of Americans 
each year.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues and the American people to 
keep a healthy perspective. We did not enact the Affordable Care Act to 
launch a Web site. We did it to ensure that every American has access 
to affordable, quality care, and we should all work together to 
accomplish that goal.

[Pages S2320-S2321]
                    AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ANNIVERSARY

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, three years ago tomorrow, President Obama 
signed into law the Affordable Care Act. This landmark law will extend 
health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans when the 
reforms are fully implemented next year. Getting to this point has been 
an arduous process. But in the end, this achievement proved that real 
reform is possible, and that the voices of so many Americans who over 
the years have called on their leaders to act have finally been heard.
  Since its passage, Americans have seen the immediate benefits of the 
Affordable Care Act and 3 years later, those improvements continue. 
Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions are continuing to 
receive help when trapped within the coverage gap known as the doughnut 
hole. The Affordable Care Act completely closes the coverage gap by 
2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to afford 
prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7,000 Vermonters 
received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their prescription 
drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year alone, nearly 6,400 
Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their 
covered brand-name prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of 
$765 per person. Since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, 
more than 5,000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance 
coverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their 
parents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are 
seeing in Vermont go on and on: in 2011 and 2012, 71 million Americans 
and 151,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and 
received preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay, 
including more than 80,000 Medicare beneficiaries. These are just a few 
of the dozens of consumer protections included in the law that are 
benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day, and in many ways.
  The law goes into full swing next year as even more consumer 
protections are implemented and millions more Americans gain access to 
health insurance coverage. Beginning in January, insurance companies 
will no longer be allowed to deny coverage to individuals with 
preexisting health conditions or to charge higher premiums based on 
health status or gender. Unfortunately, estimates show that 44,000 
Vermonters currently do not have health insurance, but with the 
Medicaid expansion contained in the Affordable Care Act, 84 percent of 
these Vermonters will qualify for Medicaid or a premium tax credit. 
Also important to Vermonters, to assist Vermont with our State's work 
on implementing Vermont's State-based health insurance exchange--or 
marketplace--Vermont has received more than $125,000,000 in grants for 
research and for information technology development, as well as almost 
$3,480,000 for maternal health programs. These tangible initiatives 
help at-risk families gain the support they need to improve their 
children's health and ability to learn, and they help prevent child 
abuse.
  I was proud as well to work with Senator Grassley and others to 
include strong anti-fraud provisions in the law that already have 
helped prevent and detect fraudulent activities that in the past have 
cost American taxpayers multiple millions of dollars each year. Thanks 
in part to these efforts, $4.2 billion was returned to taxpayers last 
year alone.
  In only 3 years, Vermonters across our State have seen the many 
benefits of health care reform unfold in their lives. I see and hear 
about these improvements and pocketbook savings in visits to every 
corner of our State. At home in Middlesex and throughout Vermont, 
whether I am in the grocery store, at the gas pump, or at church, I am 
constantly reminded of how important access to quality affordable 
health care is to individuals and families. I applaud Vermont's efforts 
to expand the Affordable Care Act's reach even further to help every 
resident secure health insurance. I am proud that the Affordable Care 
Act offers Vermont the foundation it needs to reach this goal, and I 
look forward to working to see that it is met.
  Regrettably, opponents of the Affordable Care Act continue to 
misleadingly attack the law in an attempt to undermine its 
implementation. The moment President Obama signed this bill into law, 
opponents sought to continue their political battle by challenging the 
landmark legislation in the courts. With the legal challenges now 
nearly resolved, we are now seeing amendments filed to every bill we 
consider on the floor, aimed at repealing or gutting the Affordable 
Care Act. In fact, on the budget resolution we are considering today, 
dozens of amendments have been filed in an effort to block the 
Affordable Care Act's implementation, to undermine its success in 
making lives better across the land, or to repeal the law completely. 
This is unfortunate, it is shortsighted, and it is cynical. Even more 
shameful is the budget resolution considered and passed by the House 
this week. The House-passed budget would make drastic changes to the 
Medicaid Program causing 14 to 20 million Americans to lose health 
coverage; it would replace Medicare with a voucher scheme costing 
seniors at least $6000 more per year; and would completely repeal all 
the consumer protections included in the Affordable Care Act.
  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but in the true interests of 
the

[[Page S2321]]

people we represent we should be working together to ensure its 
success. We can make improvements where necessary, but we must allow 
full implementation to continue. Already the Affordable Care Act has 
changed so many lives for the better, and we must not turn our backs on 
the millions more who will have access to health care next year because 
of these reforms.
  The Affordable Care Act is a tremendous achievement that will improve 
the lives of Americans for generations to come. This anniversary is a 
time to renew our commitment to completing this important work on 
behalf of the American people, who are counting on us to do the right 
thing. With each year that we move forward to implement the features of 
this landmark health care reform law, the stories of families not being 
able to gain access to affordable coverage are becoming fewer and fewer 
and are being replaced by stories of the success of these reforms, one 
family at a time, all across Vermont and all across America. I look 
forward to continuing to work with Vermont and with the administration 
as the law moves forward in its fourth year.

             MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act was passed now 
almost 3 years ago, and the Affordable Care Act was going to lower 
costs. And why wouldn't you like it? You get free stuff.
  Well, how do you pay for that free stuff?
  It turns out five new taxes were started on January of this year. 
What are they, and who do they affect?
  Well, there's a big tax on medical devices. Now everyone talks about 
wanting to encourage American investment, encourage American 
manufacturing. But with this tax we're encouraging manufacturers to go 
offshore.
  Flexible spending accounts are now limited. Who's affected by 
flexible spending accounts? Well, people with predictable recurrent 
medical expenses who might want to set some of those dollars aside and 
pay for them with pretax dollars. Those amounts are now limited, so 
people with chronic illnesses, families with special needs children are 
going to be affected.
  There's a surtax on investment income. The economy's trying to 
recover. Why would we tax investment income?
  Itemized deductions are now going to be limited for people who 
itemize their deductions. So who is affected by that? People with the 
highest medical expenses.
  And then finally, the Medicare payroll tax hike. Might sound like a 
good idea. Medicare might need more money, but this money doesn't go to 
Medicare. This money goes to fund new programs.
  Look, 3 years ago we were all told, if you like what you have, you 
can keep it. If you like your insurance, you can keep it. If you like 
your doctor, you can keep him or her.
  Turns out, what we should have been hearing is, you're going to pay a 
lot more to get a lot less.

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2014

  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I rise today to applaud the 
Affordable Care Act's historic first open enrollment along with the 8 
million people who now have the health security they deserve.
  And I am proud of the immense contribution California has been to 
these surging numbers. More than 3 million California consumers 
enrolled in health insurance plans or in Medi-Cal.
  Moreover, after connecting my district to over 20 events and 
enrolling over 2,300 residents through my ``Enroll OC'' initiative, 
Orange County alone represented 10 percent of all California 
enrollments.
  These final enrollment numbers are promising and although we have 
surpassed our goals, enrollment is only the first step.
  We must now shift our focus to educating these new consumers about 
the services available to them through their health insurance 
providers.
  Therefore, as an effort to educate new consumers in my district, I 
will be initiating a new campaign and hosting ``Know Your Benefits'' 
events throughout Orange County.
  And I urge my colleagues to go beyond the kind of work necessary to 
reach those who the law was meant to help.

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, with the deadline to sign up for the 
Affordable Care Act approaching, I want to encourage everyone, 
especially young people and people in my district, to sign up for 
health insurance.
  For those who think the process is too cumbersome or you won't get an 
affordable rate, listen to this story from a 29-year-old woman from New 
Jersey, Fawziah Qadir. She said: My employer agreed to provide $300 a 
month towards any health plan I could find.
  Unfortunately, trying to find an affordable insurance plan on her own 
in New Jersey where she lives, she said, was insane. One quote was over 
$700; others provided flimsy coverage.
  Full of frustration, Fawziah's mother told her about the health care 
insurance marketplace. She says that when she logged onto 
healthcare.gov, she was surprised to find out how easy it was to 
enroll.
  With her employer's contribution, she has a comprehensive plan that 
costs just $63 a month. That is less than a cell phone bill or a cable 
bill, and we are talking about something much more important--our 
Nation's health.
  Don't wait. Go to healthcare.gov and find a plan that works for you.

            HIDDEN TAXES INCLUDED IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, you wouldn't know it by the weather, but it 
will soon be April, and tax day is right around the corner. As 
Americans scramble to gather their W-2s and other important tax 
documents, many are unaware of the extra hidden taxes included in the 
Affordable Care Act that will ultimately fall on them.
  These hidden taxes will surprise and catch hardworking families and 
small businesses off guard and put a strain on family budgets that are 
already stretched thin.
  A 3.5 percent tax on insurance premiums, a 2.3 percent medical device 
tax--raising the cost of pacemakers, prosthetics, stents, and more--a 
tanning tax, an investment income and Medicare payroll surtax, the list 
goes on and on; and all these costs are passed on to Americans and 
families in our communities.
  That is hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars leaving our 
communities, out of the pockets of hardworking families in States like 
Kansas and heading to Washington, D.C.
  Mr. Speaker, with the many challenges Americans face today, the last 
thing they need this tax season is to carry a heavier government tax 
burden on their backs.

             GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, when we needed 
bipartisan action to lower costs and improve health care, Congress 
passed the Affordable Care Act on a party-line vote.
  Given the growing number of failures that have been revealed since 
the law's implementation began, it is time for Congress to work 
together to address the unworkable provisions for the good of the 
American people.
  Fortunately, opposition to the ACA's flawed policy is moving beyond 
party labels. Last year, the Democratic-led Senate voted 79-20 to 
repeal the law's medical device tax. Since then, more and more Members 
of Congress recognize there are bigger problems.
  Earlier in January, despite the Obama administration's vocal 
opposition to the efforts to boost consumer protections under the law, 
a veto-proof majority of Republicans and Democrats in the House voted 
to pass H.R. 3811, which would help secure personal information on the 
online exchanges.
  Madam Speaker, the American people deserve bipartisan solutions.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mrs. NEGRETE McLEOD asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. NEGRETE McLEOD. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is moving 
in the right direction and delivering what the law was intended to do: 
delivering a wider range of medical services to all Americans, 
including improved access to mental health services.
  The administration announced that $100 million of additional funding 
would be made available to expand and improve the way Americans receive 
mental health services.
  According to the California HealthCare Foundation, nearly one in six 
Californian adults has a mental health need and approximately one in 20 
suffers from a serious mental illness that makes it difficult to carry 
out major life activities. The rate among children is higher where one 
in 13 suffers from a mental illness that limits participation in daily 
activities.
  While most mental illnesses are treatable, those with mental illness 
often struggle to get needed treatment if they do not have health 
insurance that covers mental health services. Starting next year, 
insurers would not be able to deny coverage or charge an individual 
more due to preexisting health conditions, including mental illnesses. 
The health care law would also require most health plans to cover 
recommended preventive services like depression screening for adults 
and behavior assessment for children.

[[Page H7460]]

the Affordable Care Act is having in my home State of California.
  A woman by the name of Melanie wrote the following letter to the L.A. 
Times:

       My daughter and I have been without health care for 3 years 
     following my loss of employer-provided insurance. In that 
     period, I have paid handsomely for those times when my 
     mother-ministrations were not sufficient and I had to seek 
     the care of a very expensive doctor. I've been waiting 
     eagerly for ObamaCare for the two of us since the law was 
     enacted in 2010.
       Did I run into problems when I first tried to sign up in 
     California? I did.
       Did I persevere? I did.
       Did I finally get through? I did.
       In January, I'll be able to take care of a condition I've 
     ignored for the last 2 years, and my college-age daughter 
     will be covered as well. Although the subsidy certainly 
     helps, I will be paying something for coverage we haven't had 
     for years. To those who cry foul, I say ``score.''

  Mr. Speaker, I couldn't have said it better. The reality is that 
because of ObamaCare, millions of vulnerable Americans now ``score.''

  (Mr. McCAUL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Affordable 
Care Act.
  As the American people know, Members of Congress now are covered by 
this law. And, rightly so, we should engage in the D.C. exchange. I 
want to tell you about my personal experience with the D.C. exchange.
  The President said you can keep your health care plan and that your 
premiums will go down. Mr. Speaker, I lost my health care plan. I have 
five children. My premiums have gone up significantly. I don't know if 
I can keep all the same doctors that treat my children.
  If this is such a great law, why isn't the President of the United 
States covered by this law? On day one, why didn't the President of the 
United States have a Rose Garden ceremony as customer number one under 
his law, ObamaCare, and sign up for this? The answer is that he hasn't 
signed up for it because maybe he doesn't think it is good enough for 
his family, but yet it is good enough for the American people.
  That is the height of hypocrisy and arrogance in Washington, and it 
needs to stop.

                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS UNAFFORDABLE

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, some are trying to create the 
impression that the only problem with ObamaCare is the Web site, and 
the experts will soon fix that. Actually, the biggest problem with the 
so-called Affordable Care Act is that it is unaffordable.
  We are already having trouble paying for all of the Federal medical 
programs we have now. The cost of all of our Federal medical programs 
have been greatly underestimated at the start.
  Now with many millions more losing their coverage than the 
administration predicted, added to the millions previously uninsured, 
the cost of ObamaCare is already estimated at possibly four times more 
than when it was passed, and it is not even fully in place.
  Since it took 3\1/2\ years to even get a screwed-up Web site 
partially ready, most people don't believe the Federal Government can 
run our health care system efficiently in the first place. More 
bureaucratic, less-humane medical care, and all at much greater cost to 
taxpayers at both the Federal and State levels.
  This plan is a mess that will ultimately lead to shortages, waiting 
periods, and a great decline in the quality of American medical care.

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues have highlighted the 
challenges of implementing the Affordable Care Act at the Federal 
level. While these must be addressed, I would like to take a minute to 
highlight the successes we have seen at the State level in Rhode 
Island. Although a majority of States opted not to operate an exchange 
of their own, Rhode Island chose to be a leader in creating a State-
driven, integrated marketplace to provide quality, affordable health 
insurance for its citizens.
  On October 1, Health Source RI, the Ocean State's online portal and 
health insurance marketplace, opened for business. It has successfully 
enrolled over 5,000 residents to date without many of the issues 
plaguing the Federal Web site. Of course, we are still at the beginning 
stages of this process, and efforts are under way to improve and expand 
the successful rollout with many of our State partners.
  This has been a highly collaborative effort, and I look forward to 
continuing our work together so that individuals, families, and small 
businesses can shop for insurance that meets their needs based on 
transparent, competitive pricing and robust coverage.

  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, even with the difficulties of the health care 
Web site, we are seeing great things coming out of this Affordable Care 
Act. Across the country, millions of people who lacked affordable 
health care options yesterday are checking out their new options today. 
This law is working.
  I continue to hear scores of success stories from California. 
Marilynn, who is a breast cancer survivor, was paying nearly $1,300 a 
month for her Anthem Blue Cross policy. Through Covered California, she 
is saving now more than $500 a month.
  Although the healthcare.gov Web site has had its problems--that we 
are fixing--know that the California exchange has become a model for 
the rest of the country. Early enrollment results demonstrate that 
Covered California is working and people are signing up. We led the 
Nation in our readiness for this new law, and newly released numbers 
show that 131,000 Californians have already enrolled in new quality 
health plans on Covered California, more than any other State exchange.
  Rather than rooting for its failure, let's work together to make this 
a reality for all Americans.

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice 
the concerns of a small business in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional 
District, whose economic security is in jeopardy due to the Affordable 
Care Act.
  The is the story of a sixth-generation, family-run business that has 
been marginally profitable over the years. The business has grown 
through tough times, while staying committed to always providing health 
care insurance through policies that allow their employees the choice 
and the flexibility to have the doctor that they want.
  Since the ACA has taken effect, this business is now facing drastic 
increases in costs, which threaten their profitability and, in turn, 
this threatens jobs in our community.
  The President has offered the American public little assurance that 
he can save the plans, plans that he originally said we could keep. The 
public doesn't need another press conference or PR fix. They need real 
solutions moving forward.
  I commend my 39 Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who joined us in passing the Keep Your Health Plan Act today. These 
Members realize there needs to be accountability in government. The 
American people deserve as much.

             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT--A WINNER FOR SENIORS

  (Mr. COURTNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, the government announced yesterday good 
news for seniors: their Medicare part B premiums for 2014 will go up 
zero dollars and zero cents. It will stay at $104 per month. This is 
now the third year in a row that CMS Medicare part B premiums have 
defied the trustees' predictions and have come in lower than projected. 
It also defies the relentless campaign of misinformation that seniors 
have been subjected to that their Medicare part B premiums are going to 
go up.
  Just on Friday, I was at a senior fair where a woman showed me a 
chain email that read that Medicare part B premiums for 2014 were going 
up to $247 a month--just a viral infection that has been out there and 
that I have been confronted with at senior centers over and over again. 
The facts are that they are going up zero. Medicare Advantage premiums 
have stabilized. Medicare part B premiums have stabilized. Prescription 
drug costs have gone down because of closing the doughnut hole.
  In every respect, the Affordable Care Act since it passed in 2010 has 
been a winner for seniors, and it has helped strengthen the solvency of 
the program. Again, Medicare part B premiums are going up zero for 
2014.

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that there is plenty to 
disagree about in Washington, D.C. The House majority continues to 
believe that funding special treatment for Members of Congress in the 
Affordable Care Act is wrong. The House majority continues to believe 
that the American people need a reprieve from the new government 
insurance mandate for 1 year--the same reprieve that has been given to 
businesses, unions, Congress, and other groups. We should all be 
treated equally and fairly under the law, and Congress should have to 
follow the same laws it dictates to the rest of America.
  But as we continue to negotiate over this divide, let's start funding 
the things we agree on. Let's fund veterans programs. Let's fund the 
NIH clinical trials. Let's fund Head Start, WIC programs. Let's open up 
the World War II Memorial. Surely, even in the divided times we live 
in, we could set aside our differences and start reopening the doors of 
government. This shutdown is wrong and the American people are hurting.
  Let's please start working together, getting past our differences, 
finding points of agreement, and let's forge ahead together united as 
Americans.

  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acquaint you and my 
colleagues with Mr. Butch Matthews, a 61-year-old former small 
businessman from Little Rock, Arkansas, who used to wake up every 
morning at 4 a.m. to deliver canned beverages to retailers before 
retiring in 2010.
  A lifelong Republican, he was heavily skeptical of the Affordable 
Care Act when it first passed. ``I did not think ObamaCare was going to 
be a good plan; I did not think it would help me at all'' is what he 
said. But after a little research, he has now found out that he can get 
a better plan than he already had and at the same time save $13,000 a 
year.
  When he was asked what would he say to people who are skeptical about 
the plan, Mr. Matthews says this: ``I would tell them to learn more 
about it before they start talking bad about it.''
  Mr. Speaker, he is still a real strong Republican, but he says: I'm 
very happy this came along.

                  BENEFITS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, western New York has long distinguished 
itself as a leader in innovation and cutting-edge medical research. 
Buffalo gave the world cancer research when the New York Cancer 
Laboratory was first established by Dr. Roswell Park in 1897. Today, 
the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus continues to grow and thrive with 
the expansion of Roswell Park, plans for the University of Buffalo 
Medical School, and construction of a new women and children's 
hospital.
  I'm pleased to say that today western New Yorkers continue to receive 
good news about the availability and accessibility of health care. 
Yesterday, The New York Times reported that New York State health 
insurance purchased through the State exchanges will reduce insurance 
rates by at least 50 percent. Additionally, thanks to the Affordable 
Care Act, 37,000 kids with preexisting conditions will not be denied 
coverage because by law they can't be denied coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, health care should be affordable and accessible to all 
Americans. The progress we have already seen is promising, and we must 
keep moving forward.

  (Ms. MENG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this 
38th attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Our country needs affordable care. My constituents in Queens, New 
York, need affordable health care. Right now, only 17,000 New Yorkers 
buy their own health insurance because the insurance premium rates are 
too high, and 2.6 million New Yorkers do not have health insurance. 
Nationwide, 13 million people are uninsured.
  The most exciting part is that ObamaCare is already working. As of 
this morning, the new, approved health care premiums available in the 
New York State health care exchanges for 2014 are, on average, 50 
percent lower than this year's insurance premiums. That is not even 
taking into account individuals who can take advantage of other Federal 
subsidies and that everyone with a health insurance plan will be able 
to gain access to basic, free preventative health care services.
  I want to thank New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State 
Legislature for their leadership on this issue.
  With all the partisan sniping across the aisle about health care, we 
cannot lose sight of why our country needs ObamaCare. Better access to 
affordable, preventative health care is essential to reining in health 
care costs; and more importantly, it's essential for a healthy America.

  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, the House will again vote to address the 
imprecisely named Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Critics

  Within the last month or so, we've heard from the Senator who 
authored the law refer to it as a coming ``train wreck''--that's right, 
he called it a ``train wreck'';
  We've heard the administration official responsible for helping set 
up the insurance exchanges worry that the public might be in for a 
``Third World experience'' as they try and find health care;
  Oh, and let us not forget some of the very same Members of Congress 
who voted to foist this massive overreach on Americans are now 
feverishly trying to find ways to exempt themselves and their staffs 
from its effects.
  Let's look at the checklist, shall we?
  Premiums shooting up, check;
  Small businesses hiring fewer workers and jobs being lost, check;
  Employees seeing their hours cut, check;
  Faulty cost projections, check.
  Everything that opponents of this law listed as a reason to vote 
against this example of government overreach is actually occurring and 
happening.
  Tilting at windmills, Mr. Speaker, hardly. Working to protect the 
American people from a horribly disruptive and ineffective law,

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Americans want and need 
greater access to health care, and they deserve reforms that will lower 
costs and expand access, but without undermining quality and 
innovation.
  These were the promises of the President's health care reform law. 
They were worthy goals. Unfortunately, they are not reality.
  To the contrary, over the past 3 years, families and businesses have 
seen a 400 percent premium increase for health care. Patients are being 
denied coverage that physicians will not accept. Employers have slowed 
hiring under new costs and the fear of what is ahead.
  This Congress has rescinded funding for or completely repealed eight 
separate provisions of ObamaCare. Key provisions of the act are 
beginning to collapse under the weight of their own irreparable flaws. 
And even my Democratic colleagues have warned of the law's looming 
``train wreck.''
  Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. Full repeal of this 
flawed policy is the first step to enacting commonsense reforms to 
actually lower costs and expand access. Only then can we enact a law 
that can be truly called the ``Affordable Care Act.''

  Mr. BARBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about commonsense

in March of 2010 and I didn't vote for the Affordable Care Act, but I'm 
here today to ensure that it meets the needs of small businesses and 
middle class families.
  That's why I've spent a lot of time listening to small business 
owners and staff, to seniors, and to hospital employees and physicians 
in Arizona about their concerns. That is why I have cosponsored 
legislation to repeal the medical device tax, the annual tax on health 
insurance, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board. These actions 
will protect families and small businesses from premium hikes, and 
protect access to health care for seniors and all Americans. This is 
why I'm working with the citizens of Green Valley in my district to 
keep health care affordable by protecting the tax deduction for medical 
expenses.
  These are but a few examples of how we can come together to fix this 
law. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the

  Mr. JOYCE. I rise in support of repealing the Affordable Care Act and 
preventing Ohioans from having to deal with higher health costs, $1.1 
trillion in tax hikes, and more government intrusion in their health 
care. As we near the full implementation of the health care law, it 
seems as though every day we receive more evidence that this law will 
increase health costs for ordinary Ohioans, place an enormous burden on 
Ohio small businesses owners--making it harder for those businesses to 
hire new workers--and insert more big government in between Ohioans and 
their doctors.
  My district in northeastern Ohio is home to several medical device 
manufacturing companies which will be especially hurt by the health 
care law's onerous medical device tax. It's crucial we repeal this law 
and replace it with commonsense health care legislation. Jobs and 
affordable health care are at stake.

  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this year the Supreme Court agreed to 
hear and issue a decision on the Affordable Care Act. Of course, I'm 
eager to see what happens, and I'll be following the case very 
carefully, as will millions of Americans. But important steps will need 
to be taken depending upon how the Court rules. Right now, we do not 
know if the Court will rule solely on the individual mandate or say 
that the entire law is unconstitutional. Either way, this House must be 
prepared.
  Now, House conservatives have been working for at least the past 3 
years, well before the Affordable Care Act was even passed, to craft 
policies that focused on patients instead of payments, that focused on 
quality instead of quantity, innovation instead of stagnation, and 
affordability as opposed to just being cheap.
  I'm fully committed to continuing this work and producing alternative 
legislation that will benefit the American people without putting an 
undue burden on the economy.
  The Congressional Health Care Caucus discussed this issue today at a 
briefing. James Capretta and Thomas Miller discussed and shared ways on 
which we can prepare in the coming months with specific policy ideas. 
Although no one has a clear idea of how the Court will rule, we do know 
that we need to work together to consider ideas and craft policies to 
take care of the American people when their decision is rendered.

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Now that it's the law of the land, it's time for 
everyone in the country to take a deep breath and look at what really 
is in the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare.
  If you're a senior citizen, you're now receiving a 50 percent 
discount on brand name drugs if you fall into what is called the 
doughnut hole, the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap.
  If you're a woman, you now have free coverage of lifesaving 
preventive services such as mammograms; and beginning on August 1, free 
coverage is going to include many additional preventive care services, 
so take a good look at that.
  If you're a parent, if you have children under age 19, they cannot be 
denied coverage by an insurance company because they have a preexisting 
condition.
  And if you're a young adult, you can now stay on your parents' health 
care plan until your 26th birthday, which is really important if you 
don't have a job that has health insurance coverage.
  And if you're a small business owner, like my son is, there are 
millions now of eligible small business owners that are receiving tax 
credits if you choose to offer coverage to your employees.
  So take a look. It's really good for most Americans.

  6.2 million Texans, including 1.2 million children, lack health

expansion would drastically decrease Texas' uninsured rate from an 
astonishing 25 percent to just 9 percent.
  Without the Affordable Care Act, millions of uninsured Americans will 
continue to seek primary care in our Nation's overcrowded emergency 
rooms, leaving taxpayers, property owners, to foot the bill. As a

                    DON'T REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Madam Speaker, I think it's worthwhile to remember why 
Congress passed health care reform in the first place. It's because our 
system was broken; it wasn't working.
  But just this morning, Speaker Boehner said that we needed to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act because we didn't need it because we had the 
best health care system the world has ever seen. Well, I don't think 
that was true for 17 million children who were being denied health 
insurance for preexisting conditions. I don't think that was true for 
about 3.1 million young adults who were denied coverage because they 
were kicked off their parents' insurance plans. And I don't think that 
was true for 40 million Americans who couldn't get coverage and for 
every family threatened with losing their coverage because of rising 
costs.
  If we need to tweak the law, let's work together to fix it, but let's 
not repeal it. I think that would be bad for our health.

                 GOP REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, today the House will consider a repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act for the 31st time. We will spend at least 6 
hours debating this, but not 1 minute considering a Republican 
replacement. That's because there isn't one.
  The American people are now experiencing the benefits of the law: 
allowing young people to stay on their parents' policies until the 
young people are 26; requiring insurance companies to cover children 
regardless of preexisting conditions. The Republican leadership had the 
choice to include those provisions and others in this bill. Yet, once 
again, they are choosing to deny care to millions of Americans instead.
  With this bill, the Republicans are choosing to cut young people off 
of their parents' coverage. They are choosing to end the guaranteed 
coverage for children with juvenile diabetes, autism, asthma, and other 
illnesses. They are choosing to raise prescription drug costs for 
seniors, and they are choosing to allow insurance companies to charge 
women more for the same policies as men.
  Madam Speaker, I invite any Republican in this body to come to the 
floor and to explain to my constituents and theirs why they've made the 
choice to repeal all of these patient protections while offering the 
American people nothing in return.

             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I rise today because this is a great 
country. In fact, I would call it the greatest country in the world.
  Throughout my life's history, although we have traveled mountains and 
low valleys, I have been equal and unequal in this Nation. Yet today I 
feel as tall as the pine trees because our Supreme Court shed itself of 
diverse and sometimes divisive bickering and upheld the Constitution of 
the United States.
  It granted to the American people affordable health care. It granted 
to the sickest of the sick the opportunity to be covered by insurance. 
It granted to seniors who fall into doughnut holes and who have to 
choose prescription drugs over food a relief line. It granted to 
hospitals that take in indigent patients who may otherwise die on 
sidewalks in America an opportunity to take care of those patients. It 
gave children with preexisting diseases an opportunity to live fully in 
this country.
  So now the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. We have been 
vindicated. Every single, single vote of those Members who have lost 
and of those who have won, we've been vindicated. Thank God for the 
United States Supreme Court.

      THE FATE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AWAITS THE SUPREME COURT

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, here we are, 32 hours away from the Supreme

what their decision will be. We've worked hard in preparing for any 
decision that might come from the Supreme Court,

[[Page H3984]]

and their announcement will certainly be watched by all.
  As the chairman of the Congressional Health Caucus, I've held a 
series of policy forums to discuss the future of health care in this 
country. Today we heard from Dr. John Goodman, president and CEO of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas. Dr. Goodman has put a 
considerable amount of time into how to craft health care policy that 
will be beneficial to all Americans without the burdensome law that we 
currently have.
  Additionally, doctors in Dallas convened with four Members of 
Congress earlier this month. They produced a set of principles that I 
will provide for the Record. I encourage people to spend some time and 
look at those, and understand that we have to have health care in this 
country that's patient-centered, doctor-led, and most of all, we keep 
the government out of the way.

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as the 2-year anniversary 
of the President's so-called Affordable Care Act approaches, we're 
reminded of the unkept promises. It almost seems like yesterday when we 
heard the line, ``We have to pass the bill so we can find out what's in 
it.'' That prediction

[[Page H1525]]

today stands as one of the few justifications for passage of the law to 
still hold much truth or credibility.
  Then supporters said it wouldn't cost a dime; yet last week, the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated they now expect the law 
to cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years. That's nearly double the $940 
billion originally claimed.
  Supporters said it would bring down costs; yet these new mandates 
have helped result in premium increases of up to 9 percent in my home 
State of Pennsylvania.
  Today we remain committed to repealing and replacing this costly and 
dangerous law, piece by piece, if necessary. We take a great step today 
by repealing a provision that would otherwise cede the responsibility 
of Congress to an unelected and unaccountable Medicare rationing board. 
This measure is yet another facet of that commitment.

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the ways that young 
people in my congressional district and around the country are 
benefiting from the Affordable Care Act.
  Before health reform, young adults were the age group most likely to 
be uninsured, losing their coverage right after they left home and 
entered the workforce; but thanks to the health reform law, 2\1/2\ 
million young people, including nearly 10,000 in my communities, now 
have health insurance. And some of them have reached out to tell us how 
the law is working for them and for their families.
  Jamie from Santa Barbara wrote:

       I got back on my parents' insurance and was finally able to 
     visit the dentist and get a new prescription for eyeglasses 
     that I desperately needed.

  Maria from Oxnard says:

       As a recent graduate. I felt completely vulnerable. With 
     health care reform, I am now able to stay with my parents' 
     health insurance, which has given me peace of mind while I 
     search for employment.

  Madam Speaker, health reform is working for young people on 
California's central coast. We must ensure the law stays strong to keep 
them and their families healthy, and I'll say the same for this entire 
Nation.

  (Mr. MILLER of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support 
the provisions in the Affordable Care Act that close the gender gap in 
health care. Beginning in 2014, health insurers cannot charge women 
more just because of their gender. Health insurers cannot deny coverage 
because of preexisting conditions like having survived cancer or having 
been pregnant or having been a victim of domestic violence, a condition 
that is almost as disproportionately experienced by women as pregnancy. 
And health care will have to cover preventive services like mammograms, 
screening for cervical cancer and, yes, contraception.
  Republicans in Congress are trying to block these and other reforms 
so that health insurers or employers or Members of Congress can make 
women's health and reproduction decisions rather than trust those 
decisions to women. Madam Speaker, women can make those decisions. They 
really don't need help from insurers or employers or politicians or 
radio talk-show hosts. Women want to make those important personal 
decisions for themselves, and they should.

           OPPOSING REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. CARNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this 
counterproductive effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Instead, we 
ought to focus on how we can move forward together, Democrats and 
Republicans, to address the very serious challenge of rising health 
care costs. Among developed nations, the United States spends twice as 
much as a share of GDP on health care; yet we rank near the bottom in 
health outcomes.
  Insurance premiums more than doubled in the last decade. Absent 
reform, they are on pace to double again by 2020. These costs are 
unsustainable for Delaware families and for the Federal budget. There 
can't be serious conversation about deficit reduction without talking 
about health care cost containment. Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP alone 
consume one-quarter of the Federal budget. The Affordable Care Act will 
curb health care cost growth, but there is a lot more that needs to be 
done.
  I came to Congress to make the tough, thoughtful decisions necessary 
to improve the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it. And I look forward 
to working with my colleagues to do just that.

                    AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CANCELATIONS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Capps) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the Affordable Care 
Act. The Affordable Care Act is working for many of my constituents on 
the central coast of California, like Danna in San Luis Obispo County, 
who tells me she will be saving 40 percent on her family's premiums. It 
is working for the Pacelas in Solvang, who tell me they now have better 
coverage while saving $8,000 a year on their premiums. It is working 
for the thousands of families whose young adult children can continue 
on their parents' plans, and for everyone who has a preexisting 
condition who now cannot be turned down for coverage.
  I know that this is not the case for all central coast residents, 
especially those who may have received cancelation notices this year, 
either because their insurer is only selling in the exchanges, or 
because the insurance companies have stopped offering plans in our area 
all together. Cancelation of these plans has caused real pain and 
confusion for our constituents in California who are faced with Covered 
California marketplace options that have different provider networks or 
different premium costs.
  After hearing numerous stories from the families I represent, it is 
clear we must address this problem with the implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act so we can protect all California families and 
businesses. The President has offered an administrative fix to this 
issue to allow insurance companies to offer plans to those already 
enrolled for the next year, but States will be the final 
decisionmakers.
  That is why I led a letter, with Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and 22 of 
our California colleagues, to Covered California's leadership asking 
them to implement this administrative fix without delay.
  Covered California has led the way in bringing new, quality health 
care opportunities to millions of Californians. The Web site is 
working, and enrollment is steadily increasing. But with over 1 million 
Californians receiving cancelation notices of their current plans, we 
must and we will do more to ensure that no one is left without the 
opportunity for affordable coverage. These families were told that if 
they liked their plan they can keep it, and that is a promise we must 
keep for them.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, today, the President put forth some 
conversation about the Affordable Care Act that focuses especially on 
women's health. I am absolutely delighted to come to the floor to 
address that issue in that--and I hope every woman in America 
understands this--because of the Affordable Care Act, being a woman is 
no longer a preexisting medical condition. As the mother of five 
children--four daughters and one son--I am very excited about this.
  Over the break, I had the privilege of being at a meeting with some 
researchers on the subject of breast cancer in particular, and they 
spent a good deal of the time telling us what the possibilities were 
with research that should be funded--that is a budget issue, another 
subject, but one that is related here--and that we could remove this 
threat to women's health with proper research.
  They took time to say that one thing that was helping women with 
breast cancer more than anything was the Affordable Care Act--that they 
would have access to care without being discriminated against because 
of a preexisting medical condition, that no longer would they have 
annual or lifetime limits on the health insurance that they would 
receive. The relief of the stress from all of that is a very healthy 
thing for people who have a diagnosis.
  So whatever it is--whether it is mammograms as my colleague 
Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz so generously shared her story 
with us about her experience or, earlier, as Congresswoman DeLauro 
shared hers and as other Members shared the stories of their 
constituents--this is really very important. Moms are the hubs of 
families. Many of them fear this diagnosis. Many families in America 
have been affected by it.
  With our investments in research and with the Affordable Care Act, 
women have reason to be very, very hopeful that this can be prevented 
with early detection--and not only with early detection but with 
regular detection. Then, on top of that, if they have that feared 
diagnosis, they will receive the care that they deserve.
  There is one other point I want to make about it because we all 
worship at the altar of biomedical research and what it means for our 
country and the thought that we could be rid of breast cancer in a 
handful of years: we want to make sure every woman in America and every 
person in America benefits from that research. The vehicle for that is 
the Affordable Care Act. It stands right there with Social Security, 
with Medicare, with affordable--and that is the word, ``affordable''--
health care for all Americans as a pillar of health and economic 
security for the American people.
  Today, we focus on moms--we focus on women--and we say, Thank God. No 
longer will being a woman be a preexisting medical condition.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Carson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, this week the House is voting to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 37th time.
  In every congressional district, there are seniors, new mothers, 
young children, low-income families, and young adults just starting out 
on their own. Do my good Republican friends really want to take away 
their chance for better health?
  I would never do that to my constituents, which is why I'm here 
today, Mr. Speaker, to say again, I am proud of my vote for the 
Affordable Care Act.

                              {time}  1030

  Recently, I had a chance to spend some time with some Hoosiers across 
my district, and I heard again and again their worry about rising 
health care costs and their family's ability to access care. 
Fortunately, millions of Americans no longer have to worry about 
accessing care because of the Affordable Care Act. Instead, more than 
half a million Medicare beneficiaries in Indiana alone received free 
preventive services in 2012, avoiding more costly illnesses. More than 
17 million children with preexisting conditions nationwide are no 
longer being denied insurance coverage. More than 100 million Americans 
no longer face lifetime limits on coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, over 360,000 small businesses have already used tax 
credits to help insure 2 million workers. By the end of this year, 
health exchanges will be set up making it easier for people who don't 
have insurance to choose the coverage that best suits their needs. Next 
year, we will happily welcome even more consumer protections. Insurance 
companies will no longer be able to place lifetime limits on coverage. 
Discrimination against preexisting conditions will be banned for all 
Americans.
  This means that when a woman notices a lump under her arm, there is 
no reason for her to wait until she finds a job to schedule an 
appointment. And she doesn't have to wait to get sicker, costing more 
of her time off from work and away from her family. Under the 
Affordable Care Act, Mr. Speaker, she knows she can obtain potentially 
lifesaving care right away. The same goes for her spouse, her parents, 
and her children. Our health care system benefits us by allowing us to 
make investments in lower-cost treatments and prevention now rather 
than expensive therapies later.
  Of course, I know that times are tough right now and we have to be 
even more careful about the mandates we put on businesses. But my good 
Republican colleagues seem to forget that people have to be healthy to 
contribute to our economic growth. As a Representative of many 
hardworking families, Mr. Speaker, I have stood here time and time 
again over the past few years to extend a hand to anyone who wants to 
work with me and us to provide quality health care for all Americans.
  Today, I make that very same offer. I will work gladly with anyone 
who wants to improve our health care system and ensure that all 
Americans have access to quality and affordable health care.
  I call on my Republican colleagues to work with us to implement the 
Affordable Care Act and start improving it. It's time we all stand 
together, Mr. Speaker, and start looking out for the health of this 
great Nation. Without it, we have nothing.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, roughly 
17 million American children with preexisting medical conditions can no 
longer be discriminated against and be denied health insurance by 
insurance companies. And yet, rather than focus on the key tasks of 
creating jobs and strengthening the middle class in America, my 
Republican colleagues want to tear up the health care law. They want to 
rip up the independent decision by our Supreme Court, by Justices 
appointed by Presidents of both parties, finding the Affordable Care 
Act is on firm constitutional footing, and they want to start all over 
again, putting the coverage of those millions of children I just spoke 
about at risk.
  This vote is personal. Health care is personal. When I was 9, I had a 
serious childhood illness. I spent 3 months in the hospital. My 
grandparents, who were raising me, found out that their family 
insurance didn't cover me. They made great sacrifices to help pay for 
my care. But if that weren't enough, when my grandparents then looked 
for insurance that would cover me, they couldn't find coverage at any 
price. I was considered one of those kids with a preexisting medical 
condition, never mind that I had fully recovered from my illness. No 
child should ever be denied coverage for that reason.
  I grew up believing that no family should have to go through what 
ours did. Parents or grandparents shouldn't have to worry, shouldn't 
have to lay awake at night worrying about whether they can provide for 
a sick child or whether an illness might bankrupt their family.
  Families now know that insurance companies can't discriminate against 
their children based on a preexisting condition. Turning back the clock 
so insurance companies can, once again, deny children access to care is 
simply wrong.
  It is time that we all move forward. It is time that we work 
together. It is time to make this Affordable Care Act work for the 
American people.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, this week, we're marking the second 
anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. I wanted to take 
a few minutes to speak to a number of groups that have benefited from 
the health care reform, a reform which I strongly supported.
  If you think back to the time of the debate 2 years ago, it was at 
the height of hearing stories about people across the country, millions 
of people, who were struggling to access the health care system. So let 
me speak to the struggles of two or three particular groups.
  Many adults across the country had had the experience of trying to 
get health care coverage, health care insurance, and discovering that 
because they had a ``preexisting condition,'' as it's so called, that 
they would be denied that coverage. If you look at some of the policies 
even today, you can see that the list of preexisting conditions is a 
long one. You don't have to have some kind of exotic disease or 
condition. Diabetes, hypertension, other things that plague millions of 
Americans across the country could be the basis for an insurance 
company denying coverage to you.
  As difficult as that experience was for many adults to have when they 
went to try to purchase coverage because they had a preexisting 
condition, the most heart-wrenching stories we heard were of parents 
who had a child that suffered from a preexisting condition, and that 
child was unable to get health insurance coverage. It literally was 
tearing the hearts out of families across this country. One of the 
things that the Affordable Care Act put in place was a prohibition 
against denying coverage for children based on a preexisting condition. 
That is now law as a result of the Affordable Care Act.
  Those who argue that we should repeal the Affordable Care Act, I 
cannot believe that they want to go back to a time when a family would 
have to look at their child who had a preexisting condition and know 
that they couldn't get coverage, couldn't provide health care for that 
child. I can't believe that we want to go back to that.
  A second group that benefited are young people, many of whom after 
they graduated from college could no longer stay on the health 
insurance plan of their parents because it wasn't provided for. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, if you're a young person, you can now stay on 
your parents' health insurance plan until age 26.

                              {time}  1110

  This is making a huge difference for millions of Americans across the 
country. Already hundreds of thousands have taken advantage of the 
opportunity to stay on the insurance plan of their parents, which means 
that young people, many of whom think that they're invincible but then 
something happens to them and they need that health insurance coverage, 
now they'll have it. It's still in place because, under the Affordable 
Care Act, there's now a requirement that health insurance plans cover 
young people until age 26.
  I cannot believe that those who want to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act want to go back to a situation where millions of young people can't 
access that health insurance coverage.
  And let me talk about the third group, our seniors who, 2 years ago, 
were dealing with the situation of having to come out of pocket for 
prescription drugs because of the so-called doughnut hole under the 
prescription drug benefit program. Under the Affordable Care Act, we 
put in place the opportunity now to begin closing the doughnut hole and 
making sure that seniors who are in the doughnut hole have access to a 
50 percent discount on prescription drugs, brand-name prescription 
drugs.
  So now our seniors, many of whom before were having to make a choice 
between do I cover the cost of food, do I pay the rent, or do I cover 
the cost of my prescription drugs because they were having to come out 
of pocket, now, many of them don't have to make that terrible choice 
because of the assistance provided by the Affordable Care Act.
  I cannot believe that those who are urging the repeal of health care 
reform want to take our seniors back to a place where they have to make 
that terrible choice between whether to

[[Page H1437]]

cover the rent, buy food, or pay for their prescription drugs.
  Madam Speaker, there are so many good things already in place as a 
result of the health care reform, and I cannot believe that those who 
want to repeal it want to deny our children, want to deny our young

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, the centerpiece of President Obama's 
2008 Presidential campaign was the promise of health care reform. He 
told us, time and time again, that every President has seen the urgency 
of reform, that all of them had attempted reform, and none succeeded.

[[Page H4071]]

  President Obama reminded us of the fact that having more than 40 
million uninsured Americans is unacceptable. It is not only bad for the 
individual, but it is for the American economy. It is bad for hospitals 
who absorb the loss for these indigent patients or shift the costs to 
other patients.
  During the campaign, the President went on to painfully highlight the 
unfair practices of some insurance companies in making people think 
they have quality insurance policies, when, in fact, in many instances, 
it is not worth the paper it is written on.
  After fierce debate, and after the right-wing Tea Party instilled 
unfounded fear in the hearts of good Americans, the Congress passed the 
Affordable Care Act, and it is good policy for the American people. But 
there are those who have exploited the legitimacy of the Affordable 
Care Act, and now we await a ruling from the Supreme Court on the act's 
constitutionality.
  Should the Supreme Court decide to undermine the most vital provision 
of the law, the individual mandate, one thing will be clear: it would 
be an act of judicial activism and judicial overreach, placing the 
Court firmly in the role of Congress.
  Precedent for the Affordable Care Act already exists. Social Security 
is a program which all Americans are required to pay into and to 
participate. Car insurance is mandated in almost every State; yet the 
Supreme Court is on precipice of possible unfastening the linchpin that 
makes true health care reform attainable.
  Such a decision would confiscate benefits that the public and 
businesses largely support. Lifetime coverage limits could be re-
imposed on 100 million Americans. Seventeen million children with 
preexisting conditions could lose insurance coverage, and 6 million 
young adults may be forced off their parents' insurance plans.
  Preservation of this law means 40 million uninsured Americans will be 
insured. It creates state-run health exchanges to give consumers 
maximum choice when selecting a policy, and it contains skyrocketing 
costs in medical care. The Affordable Care Act will lower insurance 
premiums driven by uncompensated care for the uninsured, saving the 
average family in North Carolina $1,400 a year.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act has already paid great dividends 
in my district. Under the law, 94,000 seniors have received Medicare 
preventive services without paying a dime. More than 5,000 young adults 
have health insurance when they previously did not. About 400 small 
businesses received tax credits to expand care to their employees; 
34,000 children with preexisting health conditions can no longer be 
denied.
  As a policy-maker representing 700,000 people, I hope the act will 
remain intact. As a former judge, I hope the Supreme Court recognizes 
the impact an unfavorable decision will have on the role of Congress.
  We cannot let the perfect, Mr. Speaker, be the enemy of the good. We 
should explore ways to improve upon the law instead of ways to further 
deny Americans access to affordable health care.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I, along with most Americans, celebrated 
Mother's Day yesterday with my wife, my daughter, and my grandchildren, 
to express our appreciation for what mothers all over the world have 
done in order to help our communities. In America, we have taken action 
to help women in this country. I am referring to the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act, which has helped childbearing women and child 
rearing throughout the child's life, as well as the mother and the 
family.
  Let me give some examples because I think it is good to point out 
where we have made progress and to celebrate what we have done to help 
women in America. We have taken on the arbitrary practices of private 
insurance companies that discriminated against women, against pregnant 
women, and against mothers. A woman can now choose her own OB/GYN 
doctor as her primary care doctor, no longer having to wait for 
authorization or to get a referral in order to have OB/GYN care. Women 
now have the absolute right to choose their own primary care doctor, 
including an OB/GYN.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman in America is guaranteed 
an annual well-woman visit to be able to assess their health, including 
mammography screening, pap smears, diabetes screening, and other 
preventive screenings services at no cost. That is all provided in the 
Affordable Care Act, so a woman can take care of her own health care 
needs and, in many cases, avoiding much more costly and debilitating 
care. Again, this is at no cost. So there is no reason why a woman 
cannot take advantage of these services. HPV DNA testing is now 
available every 3 years under the Affordable Care Act to deal with the 
sexual health of women. STI counseling and HIV screening for sexually 
active women are now available under the Affordable Care Act. This is 
now guaranteed. Women don't have to go look at the fine print of an 
insurance policy to see whether they have coverage. Before, in most 
cases, they didn't have coverage. Women don't have to wait for 
authorization, having to show a need. These are given rights that are 
now available to every woman under the Affordable Care Act.
  No longer can pregnancy be considered a preexisting condition. Before 
the passage of the Affordable Care Act, if a woman wanted to get an 
insurance policy, insurers excluded childbirth during the first perhaps 
9 months or later. It was considered a preexisting condition. Now we 
have a seamless system, so women can get the type of care they need.
  Why does that become so important? So they can get the necessary 
prenatal care in order to keep their baby healthy, to get the type of 
tests that are necessary.
  Pregnant women can now get a gestational diabetes screening to see 
whether they are at high risk and, if so, they can get the type of 
treatment they need in order to make sure their baby is born as healthy 
as possible.
  Prenatal care is available and it is covered, and we now have, 
through the Affordable Care Act, a provision we added that provides 
support for qualified health centers. I have visited qualified health 
centers in Maryland that are now providing prenatal care that wasn't 
there before. It is not only that we are providing coverage; we are 
providing access to care, so we can reduce low birth weight babies in 
our community. Look at the numbers of infant survival. Look at the 
numbers of low birth weight babies. We are improving those numbers 
daily because of the Affordable Care Act. To be able to prevent and 
discover complications during pregnancy, including preterm outcomes--
all of that is now available.
  Women now have access to folic acid to make sure a woman has a 
healthier fetus and birth. All of that is now available under the 
Affordable Care Act.
  We help newborns and their mothers. Breast feeding has been proven to 
be a very strong part of a healthy infancy and for a baby. There are 
certain needs a mother has, including having the time to breast feed, 
and the cost of breast feeding, including breast pumps. That is now 
covered under the Affordable Care Act.
  We understand the need to keep people healthier, and that is why we 
call it

[[Page S2894]]

a wellness program. No longer is it insurance just to take care of an 
illness or injury; it is to keep people healthy and for women 
particularly. We didn't do a good job for many years. We are now making 
up for it in the Affordable Care Act, making a huge difference.
  We are giving peace of mind to women all over this country about 
having adequate third-party coverage so they can afford to take care of 
their own health and the health of their families.
  Adult children can remain on parents' insurance policies until age 
26. We have all received so many letters from our constituents saying: 
Thank goodness we have that provision. My 24-year-old never thought she 
would get ill. Now she has this insurance coverage so we can take care 
of her and keep her healthy, and when she needs health care, it is 
available, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.
  Today millions of Americans today who didn't have it before, now have 
quality, affordable health insurance as a result of the Affordable Care 
Act. It is peace of mind. They can now carry an insurance card. I got a 
letter from one of my constituents saying how it felt to have an 
insurance card in her possession, knowing that it worked as a ticket to 
take care of her health care and the health care of her family.
  No longer can an insurance company discriminate in ratings against 
women--a huge deal. The discriminatory rates were aimed against women, 
and we have eliminated that under the Affordable Care Act.
  We have eliminated preexisting condition restrictions. I already 
talked about pregnancy. But it was amazing how women particularly were 
discriminated against because of preexisting conditions, where they 
couldn't get full coverage to take care of all of their needs. That is 
over, including for their children. Many families told us they had a 
child with asthma and they couldn't get full coverage. Now they can get 
full coverage, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. They now have peace 
of mind and adequate coverage to take care of their needs.
  We had the end of the caps on health insurance. No longer do people 
have to worry: Should I do this or not? Will I hit my annual limit or 
my lifetime limit?
  They are gone. If they need insurance, it is there to protect them. 
That is what insurance should do: Protect families.
  So we have made a huge difference.
  I am particularly proud of the prudent layperson provision for 
emergency care. I can't tell my colleagues how many times we had 
circumstances where people needed to go to the emergency room because 
they thought they had a true emergency with chest pain and sweating, 
and they would go to the emergency room. The good news was they weren't 
having a heart attack. The bad news is they got a bill from their 
insurance company telling them that because they didn't have a heart 
attack they have to pay this bill. That is over. We have now legislated 
the prudent layperson standard so it is now right for a person to seek 
urgent care, and the insurance company must cover that visit for urgent 
care.
  I could continue to list so many ways we have helped all people in 
this country but particularly women. It is tough enough to give birth 
to a baby and to raise a child. We have made it easier by taking away 
some of the burdens regarding our health care system.
  So this past Sunday, when we celebrated Mother's Day, we could also 
point to a very tangible accomplishment this Congress has been able to 
deliver for all of our mothers in this country, and I was proud to be a 
part of making that a reality.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

[Pages S6138-S6139]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, 3 years ago Congress passed a massive 
health insurance law which didn't have a single Republican vote, and it 
had significant opposition by the public.
  In an administration proclaiming to be the most transparent ever, 
this 2,700-page bill was rammed through Congress in the early morning 
hours on Christmas Eve. Even then-Speaker of the House Pelosi said 
Congress had to pass this bill so that we could find out what was in 
it.
  Well, we did. It was passed, and the American people are not liking 
what they have discovered.
  While the President promised the Affordable Care Act would lower 
health care costs and strengthen our health care system, the law, 
instead, is increasing health insurance premiums, slowing economic 
recovery, and hindering job creation. We should not allow the 
administration to continue to ignore this reality. We must permanently 
delay the Affordable Care Act.

[[Page S6139]]

  Since its enactment in 2010, 18 components of the health care law 
have been changed, cancelled, or delayed. The President downplays the 
law's substantial defects by characterizing them as ``glitches and 
bumps'' that are to be expected. He also claims that the Affordable 
Care Act critics are responsible for the law's broken promises by 
arguing that the problem is with ``folks out there who are actively 
working to make this law fail.'' Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act is 
slowly unraveling.
  Every day brings new information about missed deadlines, funding 
shortfalls, soaring health insurance premium rates, and a technical 
implementation that is floundering. Is it any wonder that this law 
continues to be publicly unpopular?
  With the majority of mandates, fees, and taxes taking effect in 2014, 
we are already beginning to see the alarming effects of the law on 
individuals, families, employers, and on our economy. It is one broken 
promise after another.
  Promise No. 1. In attempting to convince the American people that the 
ACA was good, the President promised it would ``save families $2,500 in 
the coming years.'' But since 2008, the average American family has 
seen health insurance premiums rise more than $3,000. Nonpartisan 
actuaries estimate that national health spending will grow at an 
average rate of close to 6 percent annually between 2011 and 2021. As 
national spending ticks up, American families will continue to see 
their monthly premiums go up.
  States are beginning to release details on the rates consumers will 
pay for ACA-related health insurance starting on January 1. An 
unfortunate pattern is emerging--ACA-mandated insurance is going to 
increase costs for many Americans.
  Recently, the State of Indiana announced that insurance rates will 
increase 72 percent for consumers in the individual market. Consumers 
in Ohio, Florida, South Carolina, and Maryland have also announced they 
are expecting to see their premiums increase significantly. Just 
yesterday, the Georgia insurance commissioner asked the Department of 
Health and Human Services to extend the deadline to approve health 
plans in their State because some rates were expected in Georgia to 
rise by 198 percent.
  In my home State of Kansas, I consistently hear concerns from 
individuals, business owners, and even local government officials about 
the impending costs of the Affordable Care Act.
  For example, rural Kansas school districts and special education co-
ops, whose budgets are already stretched thin, will now be forced to 
cover the costs associated with the law. This has resulted in 
reductions in employees' hours and may trigger layoffs in order for the 
districts to avoid significant ACA-related penalties.
  It is sad to visit with the director of a special education co-op 
only to learn that less services are going to be provided to special 
needs students because of the costs associated with the Affordable Care 
Act.
  The American people were promised savings and security. Instead, we 
are experiencing less of both. The Affordable Care Act is leaving 
Americans with less options and simply unaffordable care.
  Promise No. 2. In 2009, the President said:

       No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this 
     promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep 
     your doctor, period.

  Reality has since whittled down this promise dramatically. If you go 
to the Affordable Care Act Web site today, you will find this far less 
confident statement:

       Depending on the plan you choose in the Marketplace, you 
     may be able to keep your current doctor.

  Even large labor unions have recently criticized the President and 
congressional Democrats for breaking this promise. Notably, the 
National Treasury Employees Union, the union that represents most IRS 
employees, is urging its members to write their elected officials to 
oppose any effort that would force them to participate in the health 
insurance exchanges.
  Further, several unions stated:

       When you and the President sought our support for the 
     Affordable Care Act (ACA), you pledged that if we liked the 
     health plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that 
     promise is under threat.

  And another statement:

       [A]pproximately 3 million laborers, retirees, and their 
     families now face the very real prospect of losing their 
     health benefits. This, I must remind you, was something that 
     you promised would not happen.

  Promise No. 3. The President indicated that the Affordable Care Act 
would ``lower costs for . . . the federal government, reducing our 
deficit by over $1 trillion in the next two decades. It is paid for. It 
is fiscally responsible.''
  The only way the Affordable Care Act will reduce deficits is by 
grossly increasing the taxes and fees associated with this law. One 
wonders how anyone believed at the time that the new entitlement 
program would ever save money.
  These broken promises are more than just words. The administration's 
false starts and early failures in implementing the Affordable Care Act 
are just the beginning. The harm this law will do to individuals, 
families, and businesses will continue to emerge. In less than 3 
months, individuals will be asked to start enrolling in a health 
insurance exchange when insurance rates, coverage requirements, and 
subsidy amounts are still largely unknown. And, increasingly, the 
question being asked is, What happens to individuals required to buy 
health insurance or face penalties if the exchanges are not ready on 
time?
  I am the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Labor, Health and Human Services. I offered two amendments to the 
fiscal year 2014 bill that would bring some certainty to this 
overarching issue.
  First, I offered an amendment to codify the administration's decision 
to delay the employer mandate. While many of my colleagues on the 
Democratic side issued press releases praising the administration's 
decision to delay, when asked to affirmatively vote in committee to 
delay for 1 year, they all voted no. The amendment failed on a straight 
party-line vote.
  The second amendment I offered delayed the implementation and 
enforcement of the individual mandate for 1 year. While I support the 
delay of the employer mandate, in that decision, like it or not, the 
administration undermined its own credibility in stating that the 
Affordable Care Act would be implemented on time, as promised. We 
should not, and cannot, require individuals to risk their health care 
coverage by signing up for an unworkable program with a dubious 
future. Unfortunately, my colleagues--again, on the Democratic side--
disagreed. They refused to extend the exemption the President granted 
to businesses to families and individuals--to all Americans.

  The evidence continues to show that the Affordable Care Act is so 
large and convoluted that it cannot be implemented into practice. 
Reports from State actuaries, the Congressional Budget Office, the 
Government Accountability Office, and nonpartisan think tanks have 
reached the same conclusion: Almost everything we were told about the 
Affordable Care Act is untrue.
  We were told 3 years ago that we need to pass the Affordable Care Act 
to find out what is in it. Now we know, and it is not good. We don't 
need to force American families to endure another 3 years just to see 
how bad it actually will be.
  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no one can dispute that Winston Churchill 
was a statesman and the most famous in the history of our world. This 
is what he said:


[[Page S2136]]


       Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between 
     the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the 
     future.

  Why do I say that? Even though those remarks were made more than 70 
years ago, I believe there are many in Congress who should focus on 
what Winston Churchill said because it is true. For far too long 
Republicans have obsessed over the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare. The 
Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It has been for more than 4 
years.
  From the very day this law was signed, Republicans have zealously 
worked to undermine it in so many different ways. Day in and day out 
they have clamored for repeal of this bill. House Republicans have 
voted more than 50 times trying desperately to cripple ObamaCare. They 
shut down the government trying to defund health care reform. And how 
has that worked? While they have obsessed over the past, the country 
has moved forward.
  Now Republicans have to face the fact that millions of their own 
constituents, millions of Republicans are benefiting from health care 
reform in record numbers. But my Republican friends still insist on 
nothing short of repeal. So I ask my Republican colleagues, what would 
they like to repeal? What would repeal look like?
  Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans can no 
longer be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. 
What are some of the preexisting conditions that caused so much trouble 
in the past? Diabetes. How about this one: You are a woman. Many 
insurance companies considered women having a preexisting disability 
because they were women. Millions of young adults are now able to stay 
on their parents' policies until age 26. That is more than 3 million. 
Millions of seniors are saving huge amounts of money on prescription 
drugs because we are in the process of filling the doughnut hole. This 
year alone millions of Americans will receive maternity coverage. 
Repealing the Affordable Care Act would be repealing many of these and 
many more. I could spend a long time talking about what would be 
repealed.
  My counterpart, the Senator from Kentucky, will probably address the 
Senate after I finish. In his home State of Kentucky, 360,000 people 
have signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky is 
not New York; it is not Texas; it is not California. It is a sparsely 
populated State, somewhat like Nevada. Yet 360,000 people have signed 
up for coverage. Of those, 75 percent were previously uninsured. That 
is approaching 300,000 people. Over a quarter million Kentuckians who 
did not have insurance now have health coverage under the Affordable 
Care Act. In other words, ObamaCare has reduced the uninsured 
population of Kentucky by 40 percent.
  I wonder when my friend from Kentucky will explain to the 270,000 
Kentuckians how he plans to repeal the law without stripping the new 
health benefits. How exactly will he and his Republican colleagues 
guarantee that their newly insured constituents have no lapses in 
coverage? Remember, they want to do away with 270,000 people who didn't 
have insurance. They want to do away with 360,000 people in Kentucky 
who are signed up for insurance. So I await their answer.
  In the meantime, Democrats will keep looking to the future, and the 
future of the Affordable Care Act is bright. Every day more and more 
Americans are getting health coverage under the law. On Monday we 
learned that 7,045,000 people had already signed up and about 1 million 
people on the State exchanges--370,000 in Kentucky, for example. We 
know there are more than 3 million young people on their parents' 
insurance because of that. We know there are millions of people who are 
now covered because of their ability to become part of Medicaid. So we 
are talking about a lot of people.
  Health reform is working, and the law is here to stay. The more 
Americans see the law is working, the more they want it to stay. The 
time of fighting over the past is over. Remember what Winston Churchill 
said:

       Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between 
     the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the 
     future.

  I say this very seriously: I invite my Republican friends to look to 
the future. Put this obstruction behind them. Work with us to make the 
Affordable Care Act even better for their constituents and our 
constituents and Americans generally. Together, we can help millions 
more Americans get the health coverage they deserve.

             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND PREVENTIVE HEALTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, 27 years ago, I was diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer. I was lucky. I had excellent doctors who detected the cancer by 
chance in stage 1. I underwent radiation treatment for 2\1/2\ months. 
Because of the grace of God and biomedical research, I stand here 
today, and I am fortunate to say that I have been cancer free ever 
since.
  I can tell you for a fact that access to preventive health care saved 
my life. If

[[Page H7455]]

my ovarian cancer had not been diagnosed and caught in stage 1, I might 
not be here today, but many women are not so lucky as over 15,000 die 
every year from ovarian cancer. While I survived by that off chance of 
luck in that diagnosis, no one should have to survive by luck, which is 
why my Democratic colleagues and I worked hard.
  We worked very hard to make sure that prevention and wellness are 
such a critical part of the Affordable Care Act. Before we passed this 
transformative piece of legislation, one in five women over age 50 had 
not had a mammogram in the past 2 years, mostly because she could not 
afford one. Now mammograms are covered--they are covered for all 
Americans--with no out-of-pocket costs. So are annual checkups, 
colonoscopies, diabetes, and other cancer screenings--at no cost. Let 
me repeat that. They are the beneficiaries of lifesaving treatments.
  Preventive care not only helps to keep Americans healthier; it also 
helps to drive down the cost of health care so that people can get 
access to the services that they need. Chronic and often preventable 
diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, cause seven out of 10 
deaths in the United States of America, and they account for 75 percent 
of our health spending. Preventive care can help Americans avoid these 
ailments or to catch them before it is too late.
  That is what the Affordable Care Act does. That is what the people of 
this country need to know. There are countless stories, after stories, 
after stories of people's lives being saved because they have the 
opportunity to get a treatment or something that says you may be at 
risk for a particular disease, and you can get that identification not 
by luck but as a routine checkup. No one in the United States of 
America should survive by luck. Now we have an opportunity through the 
Affordable Care Act, which is the law of the land today, to make sure 
that everyone--man and woman--can get those services.
  If you expand access to preventive health, it drives the costs down, 
but most importantly, it saves lives. Isn't that worth doing, to be 
able to save someone's life? That is what the Affordable Care Act is 
all about. It is just one of the many ways that it is good for men, for 
women, for families in this Nation, and it is good for America to move 
in this direction.

                   REPAIRING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, my son played basketball at Dillard 
University. I went down to see his games as often as I could. On one 
occasion, we were driving around in his car, we were at a busy 
intersection, and the car stops. I didn't know what was wrong, but 
eventually I realized that he simply didn't have gas in it. I was not 
happy, but I didn't stand outside of the car and just continue to talk 
to him about the fact that the car stopped running and needed gas.
  What we did is, we tried to get some gas to get the car out of the 
busy intersection because a lot of people were trying to get by. It 
would have been of no value for me to stand there and lecture him or 
talk about how horrible the situation was. We wanted to fix it.
  That is the same thing with the Affordable Care Act. There are some 
problems. I think it would be crazy for anybody to say there are not 
problems. The law has already been passed by Congress, signed by the 
President, and

[[Page H7201]]

upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States.
  We would be infinitely better off if we gave our time to repairing 
the problems that are there as opposed to standing in the intersection 
talking about how bad it is.

Affordable Care Act in the State of Connecticut. Despite the hysterical 
predictions on the other side, where you would have thought the Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse would be riding through the streets of New 
London, Norwich, and Hartford, instead, the headlines this morning 
were:

       Enrollment better than expected on exchange's first day.

  Forty-five thousand people contacted the Connecticut exchange. 
Hundreds enrolled. They didn't wait until January to begin the process 
of getting health coverage.
  One of them was a lady named Elly Banos, 48 years old, who said she's 
been without coverage for a year and half due to a layoff. She's been 
holding her breath and ``thanking God every day that I don't get sick 
or get into a car accident.'' She was excited to learn that she could 
get good individual coverage for a month or qualify for the expanded 
Medicaid coverage.
  Another, Babz Ivy, said that she has gone to bed ``with a prayer on 
my lips, asking God to keep me healthy and in no need of medical 
attention.''
  ``Today was amazing,'' Ivy said. ``I felt so empowered and in control 
of my health.''
  The fact of the matter is these are the targets of the shutdown 
effort. It's not President Obama or Democrats in Congress. It's people 
like Elly Banos and Babz Ivy that we need to protect by keeping this 
government open and allowing people to get access to health care for 
the first time in American history.

  FUNDING FOR THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MUST BE 
                                 DENIED

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today, I sent a letter to Kathleen 
Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services, asking, in light of 
Judge Vinson's ruling in Florida 2 weeks ago today where a declaratory 
judgment was issued that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
is indeed unconstitutional, that further implementation of this act not 
go forward.
  In fact, Judge Vinson stated that officials of the executive branch 
will adhere to the law as declared by the court. As a result, the 
declaratory judgment is the functional equivalent of an injunction. 
There is no reason to conclude that this presumption should not apply 
here.
  Now, I believe the judge is correct, that the administration should 
not proceed with implementation, and I've asked the Secretary for 
clarification that that is indeed her position and will be her position 
going forward.
  Of course we do have debate and a vote on the continuing resolution 
to fund the United States Government for the next 7 months. It is my 
expectation that funding for provisions of enacting the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act will not be funded in the continuing 
resolution.
  The American people have made it very clear, and even recently the 
Florida ruling confirmed that the health care law is unconstitutional, 
and Congress must do its job to make sure funding for this legislation 
is denied.

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2011.
     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,
     Secretary of Health and Human Services,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Secretary Sebelius: I write to inquire of the 
     Department of Health and Human Services your response to and 
     specifically subsequent implementation decisions made by the 
     Department in the wake of Judge Vinson's ruling in The State 
     of Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human 
     Services. As you are well aware, the plaintiff sought 
     declaratory judgment that the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional as well as an 
     injunction against its enforcement.
       In his opinion, Judge Vinson relied on precedent in 
     Committee on Judiciary of U.S. House of Representatives v. 
     Miers to determine that when a court issues a declaratory 
     judgment against federal officials, the ``declaratory 
     judgment is the functional equivalent of an injunction.'' He 
     quoted a previous United States Court of Appeals decision 
     which further addressed his point, ``that officials of the 
     Executive Branch will adhere to the law as declared by the 
     court. As a result, the declaratory judgment is the 
     functional equivalent of an injunction . . . There is no 
     reason to conclude that this presumption should not apply 
     here. Thus, the award of declaratory relief is adequate and 
     separate injunctive relief is not necessary.''
       I would like to request information on how, in light of the 
     declaratory relief issued by Judge Vinson, the Department 
     plans to proceed in its implementation of the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act.
       Thank you for your time and consideration on this issue and 
     I look forward to your response. Should you have any 
     questions, please contact me in my Washington office at (202) 
     225-7772.
           Sincerely,
                                         Michael C. Burgess, M.D.,
     Member of Congress.

                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORIES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, we have been in this huge debate around the 
Affordable Care Act for quite a while now. One of the things that I 
cannot ever forget is the health care nightmare stories that I listened 
to before we passed the Affordable Care Act. As I see so many of my 
Republican colleagues gleefully celebrate the difficulties with the Web 
site or cancelations and then think that that is going to somehow help 
them in an election, I can't think about any election. All I can think 
about are people like the people whom I want to share with you right 
now.
  Let me tell you about Marty Olson. Marty built a small business 
creating marble sinks and countertops. He poured everything he had into 
his business, and it flourished. He became a job creator, in the 
language of some people. I call him a ``small business person.'' I call 
his customers ``job creators.''
  Just a few years ago, he employed more than half a dozen employees. 
Recently, things changed drastically for him. Over the course of the 
last year, his 9-year-old daughter, Abby, was diagnosed with leukemia. 
She beat the odds and was in remission for 6 months until her cancer 
symptoms returned. She is now awaiting a bone marrow transplant. Mr. 
Olson spent time with his ailing daughter, and his business began to 
decrease.

                              {time}  1030

  He is now the sole employee of the marble business. Three months ago, 
he suffered a detached artery and had heart surgery. He is still 
recuperating from his surgery and losing his insurance on January 1 due 
to a divorce. He began to search for affordable health insurance, but 
most premium quotes were too much for him to afford. The implementation 
of the Affordable Care Act means he will not be denied insurance due to 
his preexisting heart condition. The health care exchange in Minnesota, 
mnsure.org, is allowing him to purchase a policy he can afford. Without 
the plans available on the Minnesota health care exchange, he likely 
would have to choose between health insurance or paying his other 
monthly bills.
  When his business was growing, he often trained employees who 
increased his production, but sometimes lost that employee because he 
was unable to provide them with an adequate health care insurance plan. 
The small business exchange is there for him to use when his business 
grows again in the future.
  Of course Marty is not by himself in this. Tracy Brock is another 
small business owner. She has presided over a small business for 21 
years. She is able to earn enough to support herself and hire several 
part-time employees. However, her health insurance premiums have forced 
her to work six to seven days a week. Those high premiums, around $650 
a month, prevent her from taking time to enjoy life and get some well-
deserved rest. Her insurance premiums were taking most of her marginal 
profits. The assets from her business disqualified her from receiving 
any assistance with her premiums.
  Tracy had the misfortune of being a cancer patient. She also needs 
knee replacement surgery, and Ms. Brock's business has not been as 
profitable recently so she continues to work every day despite her 
health condition. She began researching mnsure.org, the health care 
exchange available in Minnesota, and she found health plans with better 
coverage at prices that she can afford. Some plans she found were only 
50 percent of the cost of her current premium. The additional coverage 
will give her more options to treat her conditions, and the savings 
will allow her to work less and enjoy life more.
  I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't look at difficulties in 
the implementation of the Affordable Care Act as a political 
opportunity. We should never take our eye off the fact that we have 
citizens who desperately need something way better than we had before 
we had the Affordable Care Act. I wish Republicans would say, You know 
what, it is there. It is passed. The Supreme Court has said it is 
constitutional, and we are going to do everything we can to make it 
work even if we would do it different, and we will offer constructive 
improvements, but we are not going to sit back and just try to wreck it 
with poison pill bills like the Upton bill last week, or with the 47 
attempts to repeal it, or with the myriad of other tricks, sabotage, 
and devices that they have employed.
  It is time to help Americans like Marty Olson, like Tracy Brock, and 
like millions of other people, including

[[Page H7259]]

one of my own interns, Abby Schanfield. Abby is an awesome young woman. 
She has had numerous surgeries since she was 10 months old. Thanks to 
the Affordable Care Act, Abby is able to stay on her parents' insurance 
until she is 26, and her parents were able to pay premiums and copays 
that have given her access to the health care that she needs.
  So for that and for many other reasons, I urge support of the 
Affordable Care Act.

              THE 40TH VOTE TO REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 2, 2013

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, there is something extraordinary taking 
place. Not only are we implementing the Affordable Care Act across 50 
states benefitting hundreds of millions of people in our country, but 
there is simultaneously an effort in the House of Representatives to 
repeal the law for the 40th time.
  Imagine. . .this is not the fourth time, but the 40th time that 
Republicans are moving to take away rights to which Americans are 
legally entitled. These are the rights signed into law by the President 
and confirmed by the United States Supreme Court.
  There's never been such an effort in Congress in the history of our 
country where a measure has been taken up 40 times. I believe my 
friends on the other side of the aisle are on the wrong side of 
history.
  I would like to highlight this phenomenon through the lens of 
constituents and the rights they have and the rights that my Republican 
colleagues want to take away from them.
  They want to reopen the prescription drug donut hole that was created 
through the program that they supported, costing seniors thousands of 
out-of-pocket expenses a year.
  They want to take away from children the ability to stay on their 
parents' insurance policy up to the age of 26.
  They want to take away lifetime limit caps on insurance policies. How 
can anyone argue that lifetime limit caps were ever good policy?
  They want to take away preventive services from Americans like 
mammograms and colonoscopies.
  They want to take away health care premiums that are actually spent 
on medical care instead of advertising.
  They want to take away the right to plain language explanations of 
plan benefits.
  And most of all, they want to take away the rights of my constituents 
to health insurance for those with preexisting conditions.
  Thomas Jefferson said in 1808 that ``great innovations should not be 
forced on slender majorities.'' I think an overwhelming number of 
American people would say they are in favor of the rights they have 
under the Affordable Care Act, versus going back to a time of 
discriminatory practices of private insurers.

     THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CONTINUES TO HURT PATIENTS AND DOCTORS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today The Dallas Morning News and the Fort 
Worth Star-Telegram carried stories that only 31 percent of Texas 
doctors are accepting new patients who rely on Medicaid. In 2010, the 
last time the survey was taken, it was 42 percent. In the year 2000, it 
was 67 percent.
  The Texas Medical Association conducted the survey and attributes the 
dropping numbers to a low reimbursement rate for physicians and 
increasing red tape. Doctors appear to be losing patience with 
government-funded health plans and government-run health care in 
general.
  You know, shortly after the Supreme Court decision, all of the cable 
talk shows talked about it's free riders that are driving up the cost 
of health care in this country. No, it's not. The biggest freeloader is 
the Federal Government.
  The Federal Government, with its Medicare and Medicaid programs being 
structured the way they are, is actually causing the cost of health 
care to skyrocket in this country, and that's something that needs to 
stop. They're freeloading on an underfunded program, and it's costing 
us money. And more importantly, it's inexcusably hurting patients.
  The Affordable Care Act is a bad law. We all knew it was bad law when 
it passed. It was written by lobbyists in secret down at the White 
House. It was a rough draft passed by the Senate that got forced to the 
House.
  This House is going to hold a repeal vote this week. I suspect it 
will pass. I urge the Senate to take up and pass this repeal vote so we 
can get on to the important business of reforming the system in this 
country.

                     AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND WOMEN

  (Ms. SLAUGHTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, I was really honored to 
serve as the chair of the House Committee on Rules and bring this 
historic Affordable Care Act to the House floor. It was one of my 
proudest moments. I'm standing here today, equally proud to defend that 
law from the ongoing war on women.
  When it comes to health care, women are classified as a preexisting 
condition. For decades, women have been routinely charged more for 
health insurance than a man who seeks the very same coverage.
  Did you know that if a business employs more women than men, it can 
choose to raise everybody's premiums, regardless of gender, to cover 
the higher cost, which is, in their mind, of insuring women?
  Women not only pay for standard insurance coverage, but they also pay 
a separate cost for maternity coverage. In Illinois, a 30-year-old 
woman must pay $278 a month and an additional $270 a month for 
maternity coverage in case she needs it.
  Insurance companies claim that these added costs are because women 
are more likely to visit doctors, get checkups, take prescription 
drugs, and have illnesses. Everyone knows that preventative care--
everyone but the insurance companies, apparently--saves us money in the 
long run. We women in the majority of the United States are tired of 
being second-class citizens.

              AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DESTROYS PATIENT ACCESS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to bring your attention to the 
front page of USA Today. The story is titled, ``Medicaid Payments Go 
Under the Knife.'' This is an issue that, unfortunately, is going to 
continue to get worse. Medicaid isn't just going under the knife; it's 
being slashed.
  The simple truth is that Medicaid has become a coverage without 
access and only an empty promise for the people who arguably may 
legitimately need its services. And the Affordable Care Act is only 
going to exacerbate the problem with patient access to physicians. The 
new health care law has changed what was a program that was designed 
for the poorest of the poor, pregnant women, children, and the elderly, 
and turned it into a one-size-fits-all government program. States will 
add 16 million new people to the program, millions of younger adults, 
putting an even greater strain on the State budgets.
  The health care law never addressed the root problem. We need to 
ensure that Medicaid spending is directed in a fashion that provides an 
actual safety net for those in need and allows States to create a range 
of products to give Medicaid patients access to their physicians and 
better care. We actually need to get back to the basics. And it is 
essential that we examine Medicaid and realize the ramifications before 
our States sink even deeper into a budgetary crisis.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 18, 2011

  Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today, I am honored to introduce a 
bill that repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and 
the accompanying Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, 
and replaces it with four specific health care reform policies which 
will improve the challenges facing our country's health care financing.
  Americans desire true health care reform that lowers premium costs, 
meets their medical needs regardless of what job they currently have or 
which state they live in, strengthens the doctor-patient relationship, 
and provides an affordable approach for medical insurance coverage for 
those uninsured or with pre-existing medical conditions. Many Members 
in Congress have expressed support for the ideas listed above and for 
the following specific solutions to these issues:
  (1) Individuals should be afforded the same tax advantages that 
businesses have by being able to deduct their 100 percent of all of 
their health care expenses from their taxes, including insurance.
  (2) Strengthen and expand new avenues for affordable health care for 
sick Americans through high-risk pools.
  (3) Expand choice and competition by allowing consumers to shop for 
health insurance across state lines.
  (4) Create association health plans, which would allow small 
businesses and other entities to form pools that will increase 
availability and allow their sheer size to negotiate lower costs for 
their employees or members.
  While it's understood that these concepts do not make up a complete 
solution to our nation's health care financing problems, they would be 
a strong foundation to start to address the inequities inherent in the 
health care financing system, while still allowing for future 
additional reforms.

            AFFORDABLE CARE ACT--FISCAL CALAMITY IN WAITING

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, almost a month after the Supreme Court has 
issued its decision on the so-called Affordable Care Act, we have all 
had time to think and dissect their opinion and start to predict how 
this landmark ruling will affect each and every one of us.
  I respect the role of the Court and the decision of the Justices, but 
I can't help but tell you I was disappointed the entire law was upheld. 
I do believe the Affordable Care Act is detrimental to our Nation. 
Certainly it has been a wet blanket on our economy, and it is a real 
threat to the future of medicine in America. Since the passing of the 
law over 2 years ago, we have seen the strain it has placed on our 
economy. The pricetag continues to increase, sometimes staggeringly so. 
There are provisions which discourage small businesses from hiring, not 
to mention the commensurate government regulations.
  Today, the Congressional Health Care Caucus held a panel discussion 
on what was one of its many panel discussions on the current state of 
health care. Karen Ignagni, president and chief executive officer of 
America's Health Insurance Plans, has said that the health care law 
won't work unless it is changed or delayed. I couldn't agree more. Dan 
Danner from the National Federation of Independent Businesses was also 
present, and he said there has got to be a way to get price signals to 
people so they can participate in the cost of their care.
  The structure of this law, through the combination of new fees 
coupled with weak penalties for those who choose to not purchase will 
force the young and healthy to shoulder the majority of the financial 
burden of expansion. Mr. Speaker, we must do away with this thing.

             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is styled 
such for a reason. Let us look back to 2009, at the time we embarked 
upon passing the Affordable Care Act. At that time in 2009, we were 
spending $2.5 trillion per year on health care--$2.5 trillion. That is 
a lot of money, and it

[[Page H1397]]

is very difficult to understand $2.5 trillion. Well, $2.5 trillion is 
$79,000 per second. That's what we were spending on health care, 
$79,000 per second. I'll be quite candid with you: these numbers are so 
huge that sometimes I do confuse them myself. That's $79,000 per 
second.
  We were spending 17.6 percent of GDP on health care. It was projected 
that by 2018, we would be spending $4.4 trillion per year on health 
care. That would be $139,000 per second. As I said, big numbers. It's 
hard to always get them correct because they are so huge and they can 
be confusing. That's $139,000 per second.
  We had 45,000 persons per year dying because they didn't have proper 
health care. We had 21 million people who were working full time and 
did not have insurance. That is 21 million people. In my State of 
Texas, 6 million people were uninsured. Twenty percent of the State's 
children were uninsured. In Harris County in my State of Texas, 1.1 
million people were uninsured.
  It was time for this Congress to act, and act we did. By passing the 
Affordable Care Act, we have reduced the cost of health care over the 
long term. It doesn't happen immediately, because the rising cost, as 
I've explained to you, was exponentially huge. It was almost 
unimaginable. To bring it down doesn't mean it comes down instantly, 
but over the next 20 years we will save a trillion dollars.
  Here's what we've done. Aside from lowering the cost, which is 
important, we also impact lives. Preventive care is there. We also do 
away with preexisting conditions. For those who did not know, pregnancy 
is a preexisting condition. We also make sure that women are not 
discriminated against. Women won't be charged more simply because they 
are females, because they are women. We equalize health care as it 
relates to the genders. We close the doughnut hole as it relates to 
senior citizens. I might also add that in '09, we were spending about 
$100 billion a year on uninsured persons, much of that in emergency 
rooms where persons had to go to the emergency room to get the care 
that they did not have by virtue of not having insurance. They were 
getting their primary care in emergency rooms. They were also getting 
their pharmaceuticals through emergency rooms. It was a time to act, 
and act we did. We passed the Affordable Care Act.
  I will close with this. We live in the richest country in the world. 
One out of every 100 persons is a millionaire. In this country, if you 
are an enemy combatant and we should capture you and wound you in the 
process, we will give you aid and comfort. In this country, if you are 
a bank robber and you're robbing the bank and on the way out we should 
harm you, when we capture you, we will give you aid and comfort. In 
this country, if you're on death row and scheduled to meet your Maker 
next week and you get sick this week, we give you aid and comfort this 
week and we send you to meet your Maker next week. In this country, if 
we can give aid and comfort to the enemy combatant, if we can give aid 
and comfort to the criminal who robs the bank, if we can give aid and 
comfort to the person on death row, surely we can give aid and comfort 
to hardworking Americans who do not earn enough to afford insurance.
  The Affordable Care Act does this. It does not require people who 
cannot afford insurance to buy it, but it does say that every person 
who can should buy insurance.
  The Affordable Care Act is making a difference in the lives of 
people. Children can stay on their parents' policies until they're 26 
years of age. This was a good piece of legislation. I supported it then 
and I still support it now. The Affordable Care Act is affordable, and 
that is why we passed it.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Finally, my first elected job, many years ago, was to an 
organization called the Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. It was the 
largest hospital in the State. It was the largest hospital district. 
People ran at-large from Clark County, the Las Vegas area, and I was 
elected to that. It was my first elected job. When I took that job, 
there was no Medicare. In that hospital, when someone came who was old 
and did not have money, someone had to sign for them--a husband, a 
wife, father, mother, brother, sister, neighbor; someone signed. If 
that person did not pay after agreeing to pay, we had a large 
collection agency and we would go after those people. It was very 
difficult sometimes to collect that money, difficult in the sense it 
was hard to do, but, more importantly, it was difficult to do because 
you hated to go after people to pay these large hospital and doctor 
bills.
  Medicare came into being before I left my job. It changed. Prior to 
Medicare, 40 percent of the seniors who came into that hospital had no 
insurance, and that is where they had to look to their friends and 
neighbors and relatives to take care of that bill. Today, after 
Medicare is the law of the land, virtually every senior citizen has the 
ability to go into a hospital anyplace in America.
  For all of these many years, going on five decades, Medicare has been 
improving and extending the lives of seniors. The Affordable Care Act, 
legislation that my Republican colleagues tend to denigrate, 
Obamacare--let's talk a little bit about Obamacare today, the 
Affordable Care Act.
  One thing that bill did is it extended the life of Medicare for 12 
years. Medicare would stay strong for future generations and for 
retirees. That is one reason we passed that legislation.
  Health care reform today is helping seniors by beginning to close the 
doughnut hole, the infamous doughnut hole for prescription drugs for 
seniors. This year; that is, 2011, because of the legislation we 
passed, Obamacare, more than 2.5 million Medicare recipients, including 
thousands of Nevadans, saved about $600 each on prescription drugs. 
That amounts to about $1.6 billion, thanks to this legislation. For 
some seniors on fixed incomes, those savings prevented difficult 
choices between literally food and medicine.
  We also had a provision in that legislation that people could get 
wellness checks, screenings, and a checkup. More than 24 million 
seniors this year got free physicals because of health care reform. 
That is progress of which America can be proud.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, the Supreme Court concluded 
three days of oral arguments about the affordable care act, the law 
Congress passed 2 years ago to provide millions of Americans with 
access to affordable health care while bringing the spiraling costs in 
this area under control.
  I was fortunate to be able to attend yesterday's argument about the 
constitutionality of the provision requiring individuals to take 
personal responsibility for paying for their health care, and to watch 
in person and in real time. Hundreds of thousands of Vermonters and 
millions of Americans across the country who benefit from the 
affordable care act did not have that access. The Supreme Court's 
decision in this landmark case will affect every American. I think 
every American should have had a chance to see it and the Supreme Court 
should open its proceedings to television and radio.
  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of 
insurance reform. Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions 
are starting to receive help when trapped within a coverage gap known 
as the ``doughnut hole.'' The affordable care act completely closes the 
coverage gap by 2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to 
afford prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7,000 
Vermonters received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their 
prescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year, nearly 
6,800 Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their 
covered brandname prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of 
$714 per person. Since the affordable care act was signed into law, 
more than 4,000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance 
coverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their 
parents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are 
seeing in Vermont go on and on: 81,649 Vermonters on Medicare and more 
than 100,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and 
received preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay. 
These are just a few of the dozens of consumer protections included in 
the law that are benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day.
  Now that the law is in effect, many of the essential 
antidiscrimination and consumer protections of the affordable care act 
are being implemented, allowing consumers to take control of their own 
health care decisions. Going forward, insurance plans can no longer 
deny children coverage because of a preexisting health condition; 
insurance plans are barred from dropping beneficiaries from coverage 
simply because of an illness; dozens of preventative care services must 
be covered at no cost and with no copay; and Americans will have access 
to an easier appeals process for private medical claims that are 
denied.
  I attended Tuesday's argument with Senator Grassley, the ranking 
member of the Judiciary Committee. He and I disagreed about the 
affordable care act when we debated it extensively in the Senate and 
passed it 2 years ago. But we both respect the important role the Court 
plays in our constitutional system. I hope that as the Supreme Court 
considers its decision in the coming weeks, it respects the important 
role of Congress, the elected representatives of the American people.
  For years, we have heard Republican and Democratic Senators 
rightfully say that judges should not make law from the bench. For the 
sake of the health and security of our nation, the Supreme Court should 
not cast aside this landmark law and Congress' time-honored ability to 
protect the American people.
  After watching the arguments and following the debate closely, it is 
as clear to me now as it was when Congress debated and passed the law 
more than 2 years ago. The Supreme Court should uphold the affordable 
care act. Looking at Article I of the Constitution and a long line of 
Supreme Court precedents dating back to the Nation's earliest days, 
there is no question Congress acted well within its time-honored 
ability to protect the American people.
  Every Member of Congress takes an oath of office to ``support and 
defend the Constitution of the United States.'' We take this oath 
seriously. As Justice Scalia said at a Judiciary Committee hearing last 
year, we take the same oath that the Justices take.
  During the course of Congress' extensive consideration of the 
affordable care act, we considered untold numbers of amendments in 
committees and before the Senate. That is what Congress is supposed to 
do. We consider legislation, debate it, vote on it, and act in our best 
judgment to promote the general welfare. Some Senators agreed and some 
disagreed, but this was a matter decided by the democratically elected 
Congress.
  Among the arguments expressly considered and rejected by Congress 
before passing the affordable care act were arguments that the law was 
not constitutional. We considered and rejected arguments that the part 
of the law now being challenged in the Court--the individual mandate--
is not constitutional. In fact, those arguments were considered on the 
Senate floor when Senator Hatch raised and the Senate formally rejected 
a constitutional point of order claiming that the individual 
responsibility requirement was unconstitutional. During the Senate 
debate on the affordable care act, I responded, publicly and on the 
record, to arguments about the constitutionality of this requirement. 
No Justice could say Congress did not consider the constitutionality of 
the affordable care act.
  The individual mandate is about personal responsibility. Throwing out 
this requirement that Americans be responsible for their necessary 
health care costs will result in tossing aside the provision that bans 
insurance companies from denying Americans coverage based on pre-
existing conditions. The personal responsibility requirement is 
necessary to ensure that Americans who do have health insurance are not 
stuck with paying the $43 billion in health care costs incurred by 
millions of Americans who do not buy health insurance, instead relying 
on expensive emergency health care when inevitably faced with medical 
problems. Congress concluded this after extensive study and debate.
  I joined with congressional leaders in filing an amicus brief 
defending the affordable care act in the case now being considered by 
the Court because I am convinced that Congress acted well within the 
limits of the Constitution in acting to secure affordable health care 
for all Americans. I believe we must defend the enumerated powers given 
to Congress by the Constitution so that our ability to help protect 
hardworking American workers, families and consumers is not wrongly 
curtailed by the courts.
  Partisan opponents of the affordable care act want judges to override 
these legislative decisions properly made by Congress, the elected 
representatives of the American people. They want to challenge the 
wisdom understood by generations of Supreme Court justices from the 
great Chief Justice John Marshall in upholding the constitutionality of 
the national bank nearly 200 years ago to Justice Cardozo in finding 
Social Security constitutional early in the last century.
  The difference between the role of Congress and of the courts is not 
a partisan one or a controversial one. In his opinion upholding the 
affordable care act, Jeffrey Sutton, a conservative, President George 
W. Bush's appointee to the Sixth Circuit, understood the importance of 
courts not substituting

[[Page S2161]]

their policy preferences for those of Congress. He wrote: ``Time 
assuredly will bring to light the policy strengths and weaknesses of 
using the individual mandate as part of this national legislation, 
allowing the peoples' political representatives, rather than their 
judges, to have the primary say over its utility.''
  Professor Charles Fried, who was Solicitor General under President 
Reagan, testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a year ago on 
the constitutionality of the affordable care act. When Senator Grassley 
asked him if there needs to be changes to the part of the law requiring 
that individuals purchase health insurance to make it constitutional, 
Professor Fried answered: ``I see no need for it because it seems so 
clearly constitutional.'' I agree with him and I do not think it is a 
close call.
  The provisions of the affordable care act are firmly rooted in what 
previous Congresses enacted over the last century to protect hard-
working Americans. Working Americans have long been required to pay for 
Social Security and Medicare by the deduction of taxes reflected on 
their paychecks every month. It is not novel for Congress to pass laws 
affecting a health care market that makes up one-sixth of the U.S. 
economy, the key to satisfying the test for constitutionality under the 
Commerce Clause.
  What is telling about the partisan nature of these challenges is that 
many of those who now claim that the requirement that Americans have 
health insurance or face a tax penalty is unconstitutional are the very 
ones who proposed it. Republican Senators such as Orrin Hatch, the 
former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and John McCain proposed 
and supported a health insurance requirement when President Clinton was 
trying to increase access to health care. They proposed the individual 
mandate as an alternative when they opposed President Clinton's plan. 
This requirement was also a part of health care reform in Massachusetts 
supported by former Governor Mitt Romney and by Scott Brown, now a 
Republican Senator from Massachusetts.
  All of these opponents were for ensuring personal responsibility with 
an individual mandate until President Obama was for it, and now they 
are against it. Their views may have changed, but the Constitution has 
not.
  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the 
conclusion of my remarks a March 24 column in The Washington Post by 
Ezra Klein, ``Why Ryancare and Obamacare look so similar,'' questioning 
Republican opposition to the individual mandate they once championed.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  (See exhibit 1.)
  Mr. LEAHY. When I hear partisan critics attacking the affordable care 
act, I wonder what law they are looking at. The affordable care act 
will protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. The law eliminates 
discriminatory practices by health insurers, ensuring that a patient's 
gender is no longer a pre-existing condition, reduces the cost of 
prescription drugs for our Nation's senior citizens, and helps parents 
continue to cover their kids on their health insurance until they are 
26. The law also provides necessary resources to help law enforcement 
recover millions of taxpayer dollars lost to fraud and abuse in the 
health care system.
  If the Supreme Court overturns the affordable care act now, it will 
be devastating to kids, families, and senior citizens. I hope the Court 
does not undo the progress we have made. Doing so depends on legal 
theories so extreme they would turn back the clock even farther to the 
hardships of the Great Depression and strike down principles that have 
helped us build the social safety net over the last century with Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
  The affordable care act builds on some of the cornerstones of 
American economic security built over the last century. I believed when 
it passed, and still believe today, that Congress acted within its 
constitutional authority to enact laws to help protect all Americans, I 
hope the Court does not overstep the judiciary's role by substituting 
its own policy preferences and denying a century of progress.

                               Exhibit 1

               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2012]

               Why Ryancare and Obamacare Look so Similar

                            (By Ezra Klein)

       Let's play a game. I'll describe a health-care bill to you. 
     Then you tell me if I'm describing President Obama's 
     Affordable Care Act or the budget released this week by Rep. 
     Paul Ryan (R Wis.).
       The bill works like this: The federal government subsidizes 
     Americans to participate in health insurance markets known as 
     ``exchanges.'' Inside these exchanges, insurers can't 
     discriminate based on pre-existing conditions. Individuals 
     can choose to go without insurance, but if they do so, they 
     pay a penalty. To keep premium costs down, the government 
     ties the size of the subsidy to the second-least-expensive 
     plan in the market--a process known as ``competitive 
     bidding,'' which encourages consumers to choose cheaper 
     plans.
       This is, of course, a trick question. That paragraph 
     describes both the Affordable Care Act and Ryan's proposed 
     Medicare reforms. The insurance markets in both plans are 
     essentially identical. And for good reason.
       The Affordable Care Act was based on two decades of 
     Republican thinking about health care. The basic structure 
     was first proposed by the conservative Heritage Foundation in 
     1989, first written into a bill by Senate Republicans in 
     1993, and first passed into law by a Republican governor by 
     the name of Mitt Romney in 2005.
       About 2008, Democrats decided they could live with a system 
     based on private health insurers, federal subsidies and an 
     individual mandate as long as it produced universal coverage. 
     A year later, Republicans decided they couldn't live with 
     such a system, at least not if a Democratic president was 
     proposing it.
       The problem for the Republicans, however, is that they 
     don't have a better--or even alternative--idea. Since the 
     passage of the Affordable Care Act, ``repeal and replace'' 
     has been a reliable applause line at tea party rallies and an 
     oft-uttered incantation on the floor of the House of 
     Representatives. But while Republicans have united around 
     ``repeal'' of health-care reform, they haven't managed to 
     come up with a policy for ``replace.''
       Instead, they've opted to apply their old policy 
     framework--the one the Democrats stole--to Medicare. That has 
     left the two parties in a somewhat odd position: Democrats 
     support the Republicans' old idea for the under-65 set but 
     oppose it for the over-65 set. Republicans support the 
     Democrats' new idea for the over-65 set but oppose it for the 
     under-65 set.
       This isn't quite as incoherent as it seems. Democrats say 
     they would prefer Medicare-for-All for the under-65 set, but 
     they'll take whatever steps toward universal health insurance 
     they can get. Republicans say they would prefer a more free-
     market approach for the over-65 set but that a seniors' 
     version of ``Obamacare'' is nevertheless a step in the right 
     direction. For both parties, it's the direction of the 
     policy, rather than the policy itself, that matters.
       There's an added complication for Republicans. They have 
     assumed huge savings from applying the exchange-and-subsidies 
     model to Medicare. But they don't assume--in fact they 
     vehemently deny--that those same savings would result from 
     the identical policy mechanism in the Affordable Care Act. 
     The Democrats haven't assumed significant savings from the 
     exchange-and-subsidies model in either case.
       If the concept works as well as Ryan says it will, then the 
     Affordable Care Act will cost far, far less than is currently 
     projected. There's no compelling reason to believe 
     competitive bidding will cuts costs for seniors but fail 
     among younger, healthier consumers who, if anything, are in a 
     better position to change plans every few years and therefore 
     pressure insurers to cut costs.
       The discrepancy highlights another difference between 
     Republicans and Democrats right now. Republicans have put all 
     their eggs in the competitive-bidding basket. If that doesn't 
     work to control costs--and versions of it have failed in the 
     past--they're sunk.
       Democrats, on the other hand, are promoting a slew of 
     delivery-system reforms in the Affordable Care Act. They're 
     hoping competitive bidding works, but they're also trying 
     comparative-effectiveness review, pay-for-quality, 
     accountable-care organizations, electronic health records, 
     penalties for excessive readmissions and medical errors, and 
     a host of other experiments to determine which treatments and 
     processes actually work and how to reward the doctors and 
     hospitals that adopt them.
       It's unlikely that the model in the Republican budget will 
     prove sustainable. That legislation would repeal the 
     Affordable Care Act, cut Medicaid by a third and adopt 
     competitive bidding for Medicare. The likely result? The 
     nation's uninsured population would soar. In the long run, 
     and quite possibly in the short run, that will increase the 
     pressure for a universal system. Because Republicans don't 
     really have an idea for creating one, Democrats will step 
     into the void.
       As a result, Republicans' long-term interests are probably 
     best served by Democratic success. If the Affordable Care Act 
     is repealed by the next president or rejected by the Supreme 
     Court, Democrats will probably retrench, pursuing a strategy 
     to expand Medicare and Medicaid on the way toward a single-
     payer system. That approach has, for

[[Page S2162]]

     them, two advantages that will loom quite large after the 
     experience of the Affordable Care Act: It can be passed with 
     51 votes in the Senate through the budget reconciliation 
     process, and it's indisputably constitutional.
       Conversely, if the Affordable Care Act not only survives 
     but also succeeds, then Republicans have a good chance of 
     exporting its private-insurers-and-exchanges model to 
     Medicare and Medicaid, which would entrench the private 
     health-insurance system in America.
       That's not the strategy Republicans are pursuing. Instead, 
     they're stuck fighting a war against a plan that they helped 
     to conceive and, on a philosophical level, still believe in. 
     No one has been more confounded by this turn of events than 
     Alice Rivlin, the former White House budget director who 
     supports the Affordable Care Act and helped Ryan design an 
     early version of his Medicare premium-support proposal.
       ``I could never understand why Ryan didn't support the 
     exchanges in the Affordable Care Act,'' Rivlin says. ``In 
     fact, I think he does, and he just doesn't want to say so.''

                     AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ENROLLMENT

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I stand here first to salute those who 
advocate against domestic violence and those who advocate for more 
stroke awareness--health care issues.
  I also stand here not only as a Member of Congress, but as a person 
who has navigated the online health care insurance marketplace system, 
so let me note some facts.
  Yes, there have been problems. Unfortunately, the Web site was not 
prepared to handle the huge volume of interest, but President Obama has 
made it clear that the delays on the Web site are unacceptable and they 
will be fixed.
  Since the marketplace has opened, healthcare.gov has had over 20 
million unique visitors. And while the site is being improved, 
consumers should keep in mind what we haven't heard from my colleagues, 
that there are four ways they can apply for coverage: by phone, online, 
by mail with a paper application, or with the help of an in-person 
assistant.
  I say to you, let us not forget the point that millions of Americans 
are now able to choose an insurance plan that will make the most sense 
for them and for their family.

  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I received an 
email from a woman who runs a small business in my district. I will 
read it to you now:

       Morgan, As you know, I'm a small business with 36 
     employees, have been paying 75 percent of my employees' 
     health care for over 20 years.
       Get a call from health care provider agent that although my 
     renewal date is March 1, the companies are offering to renew 
     on December 1 this year with a 9.8 percent increase. This is 
     to beat what is anticipated as a 30 to 60 percent increase 
     after all the effects of ObamaCare.
       Needless to say, this has reignited my frustration with the 
     so-called Affordable Health Care Act. Please stick to your 
     principles, continue the fight. Let me know what, if 
     anything, I can do.

   THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE IMPACT ON THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Mrs. Christensen) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, Tuesday was a bittersweet day. It was 
an unfortunate day because of the government shutdown, but it was a 
good day because of the millions of Americans who live in the States 
and Washington D.C., who finally had the opportunity to leave the ranks 
of the uninsured when they logged in or called the toll-free number and 
enrolled in affordable quality health care coverage through the health 
insurance marketplaces.
  However, October 1 was bittersweet for other reasons for me, and I 
rise today as a Congresswoman from the United States Virgin Islands 
because on October 1 my constituents, who are also Americans, were 
largely left out in the cold on this key part of the law.
  As a member of the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, I was 
at the table and an active participant in the drafting, negotiation, 
and

[[Page H6184]]

amending of the Affordable Care Act, and I am proud that I was. But it 
was and remains sadly clear that one of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the 
other territories' biggest public health and health care challenges 
when it comes to Federal policies is benign neglect. Despite our 
efforts, still too many people, well intentioned, just don't 
acknowledge that, for example, across nearly every health indicator, 
from HIV/AIDS, cancer, heart disease and obesity prevalence, to rates 
of uninsurance and health care provider shortages, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands often are worse off than the national average.
  So I, working in close collaboration with leadership and my 
territorial colleagues, the Black, Hispanic, Asian and Progressive 
Caucuses, worked tirelessly to ensure that the more than 4 million 
Americans who live in U.S. territories, as well as our collective 
health care systems, would enjoy the positive benefits of health care 
reform.
  The great news is that we were in very large part successful. Today, 
Virgin Islanders and other persons in the territories are included in 
the consumer protections that make it illegal for a health plan to deny 
health coverage because of a preexisting disease or to rescind or deny 
coverage when someone gets sick and to impose lifetime dollar limits on 
essential benefits.
  Today, U.S. Virgin Islanders can keep their children on their health 
plans until the child is 26 years of age. Because of The Affordable 
Care Act, today seniors in the U.S. Virgin Islands receive free annual 
wellness visits and free preventive care. They receive Medicare 
prescription drug rebate checks and meaningful help covering the cost 
of their prescription drugs. In the U.S. Virgin Islands because of the 
Affordable Care Act, our community health centers and community health 
workers are strengthened and better equipped to serve as medical homes.
  But the devil is in the details. You see, the sad reality is that 
just because U.S. Virgin Islanders are included in the law and eligible 
for these great benefits does not mean that the law has been 
implemented in a manner that allows them all benefits or to fully 
experience the positive impact the Affordable Care Act was intended to 
have on every American.
  The law gave the Governor in the U.S. Virgin Islands a choice between 
two options, and all the territories: one, to establish a health 
insurance exchange, either separately or in partnership with a State 
that was also setting up a State-based exchange; or, two, to use the 
funds that would have gone towards the exchange to expand our Medicaid 
program.
  The Governor, based on advice of a task force and consultants, opted 
for option number two. And so amid all of the information that is being 
promulgated about the opening up of enrollment for the exchanges, 
wonderful news for many Americans, my constituents and those in the 
other territories feel very much left out and unfairly treated. To add 
insult to injury, there are no individual policies being written and 
the industry is blaming it, I think unfairly and not rightly, on the 
Affordable Care Act.
  It is important to remember that because of the Affordable Care Act 
there is a very significant increase, though in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars, in funding for the Medicaid program and the 
Governor can establish a local poverty level that could significantly 
increase Medicaid eligibility. The robust increase in funding for 
Medicaid can allow for thousands of Virgin Islanders to be newly 
eligible for meaningful health insurance coverage under that program. 
Unfortunately, although the House passed a provision that would have 
changed the match, it did not make it through the Senate, so the match 
is set so high that it is difficult for us and the other territories to 
fully utilize the increased funding.
  As a physician who practiced for more than 20 years before coming to 
Congress, I know what happens to someone's health and wellness, as well 
as personal finances, when they do not have health insurance coverage. 
It is catastrophic. That is why I requested meetings with Secretary 
Sebelius to explore how and whether the moneys that could have been 
used to establish a health insurance exchange can instead be used for 
making health care reform a reality for those who are uninsured but 
make too much to qualify for Medicaid.
  So there is a small but distinct window of opportunity to work with 
the Secretary and our Governor to think outside the box, to identify 
meaningful and thoughtful solutions to the unique health care 
challenges facing the Americans in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some will 
require legislation, and I ask for the support of my colleagues on 
that; but also please let us pass a clean CR to keep our government 
open and provide services to Americans wherever we live in this great 
country.

  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, as Congress considers two pieces of 
legislation related to the Affordable Care Act, I rise today to point 
out the silly exercise we're going through. On days like today, the 
American public gets to see exactly why Congress' approval rating is at 
historic lows.
   Today, we're voting on two bills that would amend provisions of the 
Affordable Care Act. The first bill before us, H.R. 2667, would delay 
the so-called employer mandate provision until January 1, 2015. Given 
that the Administration has already said that they are delaying the 
employer mandate provision until that time, this bill won't actually do 
anything.
   Mr. Speaker, the other bill we're voting on, H.R. 2668, would delay 
the implementation of the so-called individual mandate for one year. 
This bill would severely undermine the integrity of the Affordable Care 
Act. While I wasn't in Congress when the Affordable Care Act was passed 
into law, it is clear that this provision is needed to help make 
insurance affordable for all Americans and finally end the ability for 
insurance companies to deny coverage to those who have pre-existing 
conditions. By delaying the individual mandate, this bill would raise 
premiums on working class families and cause significant harm to our 
efforts to make health insurance accessible to all Americans.
   I am proud of the work the State of Washington has done, through its 
state-based exchange and Medicaid expansion efforts, to make health 
insurance accessible for more than half a million uninsured 
Washingtonians. This will not only lead to a healthier population, but 
save Washington State an estimated $280 million by the end of 2015, and 
add 10,000 new jobs as a result of the coming health care changes.
   Before today's vote, I reached out to Washington State's Office of 
the Insurance Commissioner to discuss the individual insurance 
marketplace and the proposal to delay the individual mandate. I was 
assured that the marketplace is moving forward, full steam ahead. 
Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler said in a statement, ``Delaying 
the mandate would be unwise. It's an issue of personal responsibility. 
It's unfair for people who can afford coverage to not have it, and to 
expect the rest of us to cover the cost of their care if they become 
seriously sick or injured.''
   The decision to bring both of these bills to the floor in this 
manner is not guided by some public policy concern. It is not to put 
forward credible solutions to legitimate problems. It is nothing more 
than a cynical attempt to play politics and mock the notion that we 
should implement the Affordable Care Act in a thoughtful, pragmatic 
way.
   Mr. Speaker, I reject this false dichotomy. I support H.R. 2667, the 
Authority for Mandate Delay Act, not because I believe it solves an 
urgent problem, but for the same reason that I supported the 
Administration when they made this decision in the first place: the 
provisions have been determined to be too complex to implement prior to 
the existing deadline. I've met with several dozen employers in recent 
months who have asked for more time and greater certainty. That's what 
this bill does.
   On the other hand, I oppose H.R. 2668, the Fairness for American 
Families Act, because the individual marketplace is moving forward and 
is in a fundamentally different place. In fact, this bill would 
severely undermine our ability to provide affordable, comprehensive 
health insurance to Americans.

[From the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commisioner Updates, 
                             July 17, 2013]

       ``Delaying the mandate would be unwise. This is an issue of 
     personal responsibility. It's unfair for people who can 
     afford coverage to not have it, and to expect the rest of us 
     to cover the cost of their care if they become seriously sick 
     or injured.
       ``A critical part of the Affordable Care Act was the 
     provision requiring that insurers take all applicants. No 
     more screening out people because they have pre-existing 
     medical conditions. But to make that work, you have to have 
     as many people as possible in the insurance pool.
       ``Without an individual mandate to have coverage, people 
     would likely just buy insurance when they knew they needed 
     it. That's like letting people get homeowners insurance only 
     when their house catches fire.''

               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, 38 times? How many times will we vote to 
repeal or take away patient protection from families and to undermine 
the middle class? It makes no sense.
  Look at what we know:
  The United States Supreme Court said the PPACA is constitutional;
  Millions have already benefited;
  One hundred million cannot have lifetime limits placed upon their 
health care;
  By January 2014, 129 million cannot be denied coverage due to a 
preexisting condition;
  By 2020, there will be no doughnut hole, and already 6.3 million 
seniors save $6.1 billion on prescription drugs;
  Women cannot be discriminated against by 2014; last year alone, 90 
percent of the best-selling plans still charged women more; and
  Seventeen million children are now protected from being denied 
coverage due to a preexisting condition.
  Mr. Speaker, really, 38 times? Why? It makes no common sense.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you another letter I 
received from a constituent about the Affordable Care Act. He writes:

       About 9 months ago, my wife was forced to leave her job, in 
     part because they wanted her to travel to Boston twice a week 
     and the responsibilities to care for our daughter who has 
     cerebral palsy made that impossible. Our health insurance was 
     from her employment.
       We went on to COBRA, which cost about $1,400 per month. 
     Waiting to have permanent insurance that did not have a 
     termination date, we contacted Anthem Blue Cross for a quote 
     for private insurance.
       We were told that my wife was uninsurable for 10 years 
     because she had been treated for depression a few years ago 
     when our daughter was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and we 
     were told she would require spinal cord surgery to possibly 
     walk.
       They then said, because of her condition, the cost for only 
     my daughter and I was almost $4,000 per month. The burden for 
     the last 6 months was overwhelming. Insurance brokers 
     informed us that only the Affordable Health Care Act could 
     help us.
       Yesterday my wife signed up for health insurance for all of 
     us. Due to our income, we do not qualify for assistance and 
     we were never looking for any. All we wanted was affordable 
     insurance for my family. The policy we selected will end up 
     costing about what our COBRA payment is, $1,400, depending on 
     how much deductible we end up using, which is all we ever 
     wanted.
       I know the only reason our family is safe is because of the 
     President, who cares more about people like us than the CEO 
     of Anthem Blue Cross or Aetna.

  Mr. Speaker, I receive calls and letters like this all the time. It 
is why I worked so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act in the first 
place.
  This is a transformative piece of legislation, a law that provides 
more security for the middle class and a better, healthy quality of 
life for the entire community. It empowers patients and doctors again 
and puts them, and not insurers, back at the center of care. It makes 
important, long-overdue reforms that most people just take as common 
sense.
  But for 3 years now, this House Republican majority has been trying 
to roll the clock back and bring back the bad old days when insurance 
companies could discriminate against people with preexisting 
conditions, even children with preexisting conditions, once again. They 
want to see women pay more for the same coverage than men, be denied 
coverage because they survived breast cancer, were a victim of domestic 
violence, or had a child by cesarean section. They want to see small 
businesses lose tax credits and seniors' health care and drug costs 
continue to rise at staggering rates.
  But we are not going to go back. The Affordable Care Act is already 
making a profound difference for individuals and families in need. It 
is time to stop with the partisan political games and let it work for 
families who desperately need to have health care coverage and 
insurance that they can't afford.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, tomorrow we celebrate the second 
anniversary of the signing of the affordable care act into law. Our 
Democratic leader, Senator Reid, in his opening remarks today, outlined 
the tremendous progress we have made. I listened to the comments made 
by our distinguished Republican leader, and all I heard was: Repeal 
ObamaCare, repeal ObamaCare.
  But I never heard what they want to replace it with. They just want 
to go back to the old system where the insurance companies ran 
everything before, where people were thrown off their policies because 
they had an illness, where because of preexisting conditions people 
could not get health care coverage, where we had this big doughnut hole 
which we are now closing for the elderly?
  The one aspect I want to focus on this morning in my brief time is an 
extraordinary element of the affordable care act that is not being 
talked about a lot but which members of the committee I now am 
privileged to chair, the HELP Committee, worked so hard to include in 
the affordable care act; that is, the array of provisions that promote 
wellness, disease prevention, and public health.
  Taken together, these provisions have begun to jump-start America's 
transformation into a genuine wellness society. They are transforming 
our current sick care system into a true health care system. I have 
said this many times: We do not have a health care system in America. 
We have a sick

[[Page S1958]]

care system. If people get sick, they get care--one way or the other. 
But there is very little out there to help people keep healthy and to 
maintain wellness and to keep them from going to the hospital in the 
first place. Now, that would be a true health care system, and that is 
what we have begun to establish with the affordable care act, by 
preventing chronic diseases, enabling people to stay healthy, and stay 
out of hospitals in the first place.
  Right now in the United States about 75 percent of all our health 
care spending--75 percent of the Nation's health care spending--is on 
chronic diseases. Only 4 percent is spent for prevention. So during the 
last year we have data for--2005--the United States spent about $2 
trillion on health care. Of every $1 spent, 75 cents went toward 
treating patients with chronic diseases, many of which are preventable. 
Only 4 cents went toward prevention. That ought to tell us something 
right there. That is the old system, and that is the system the 
Republicans want us to go back to: Spending more and more to treat 
people after they get sick rather than trying to put something forward 
to keep people healthy.
  Well, in the affordable care act we have tremendous opportunities to 
again move us to more prevention and wellness. We have made 
historically new investments in this area of wellness, prevention, and 
public health. Here is one example of that, as shown on this chart.
  Before our health care reform bill, our law, was passed, just take 
the issue of colorectal cancer screening; we know, if people get it 
early and detect it early, their chances of survival are tremendous. If 
people detect it too late, then they are going to be in the hospital, 
and they are going to have cancer, they are not going to live. But we 
know, by people getting a colorectal cancer screening early, we can 
prevent a lot of unnecessary deaths and illnesses and treatments later 
on.
  Cholesterol screening: We know if people get good cholesterol 
screening, they can get on either a drug or a good diet, an exercise 
program, reducing the prevalence of heart disease.
  Tobacco cessation: Need we keep repeating around here how much it 
costs our society from the plague of tobacco use?
  Well, here is where we were before health care reform, as shown on 
this chart. About 68 percent were covered for colorectal cancer 
screenings, about 57 percent were covered for cholesterol screenings, 
and only 4 percent were covered for tobacco cessation.
  After health care reform, now there is 100 percent--100 percent--
coverage for colorectal screenings with no copays and deductibles, I 
might add; 100 percent coverage for cholesterol screenings, and 100 
percent coverage for tobacco cessation.
  That is prevention, that is wellness, keeping people healthy in the 
first place. What do the Republicans want? They want to go back to what 
it was. We have made too much progress in prevention and wellness to go 
back to the old ways of just treating people after they get sick.
  Now, again, we have been able to promote a lot of activities around 
the country to promote health and wellness. For example, in Illinois, 
the State made improvements to its sidewalks and marked crossings to 
increase student physical activity levels. You might say: Well, big 
deal.
  Well, it is a big deal. Because of these improvements, the number of 
students who are walking to school has doubled--doubled--and it is 
expected to save the school system about $67,000 a year just on bus 
costs. So kids are healthier and we save money.
  In Alabama, Mobile County is using funds from this prevention fund to 
support tobacco quit lines to help residents live tobacco free--again, 
under the Tobacco Cessation Program.
  Officials enacted a comprehensive smoke-free policy expected to 
protect 13,000 of their residents--this is in Mobile County, AL--from 
being exposed to secondhand smoke. All across America, more and more is 
being invested in prevention. We know that, for example, a 5-percent 
reduction in the obesity rate--just a 5-percent reduction in the 
obesity rate--will yield more than $600 billion in savings on health 
care costs over 20 years.
  Again, our prevention fund is out there getting people the necessary 
support and information they need to reduce obesity. So with the 
misguided efforts to repeal the health care reform law, again, most 
Americans know what is at stake. They are going to lose a lot of these 
prevention activities that enable us to take charge of our own health 
care to make sure we get our colonoscopies on time, our mammogram 
screenings.
  Every woman in America now over age 40 gets a free mammogram 
screening--no copays, no deductibles. The Republicans want to take that 
away from the women of this country. Colonoscopies, as I said, without 
copays or deductibles, Republicans want to take that away. Annual 
physicals. We know a lot of people do not get annual physicals because 
it costs money. It costs them. Now they can get an annual physical 
free--no copays, no deductibles. Republicans want to take that away.
  Again, I think we have to ask the question--every time I hear the 
Republicans talking about doing away with ObamaCare or the affordable 
care act, we have to ask: Are we going to cut short this transformation 
into a wellness society in preventing diseases, keeping people healthy 
in the first place? I think the answer is clear. Americans are not 
going to allow all these hard-earned protections and benefits in the 
affordable care act to be a taken away. We are not going to be dragged 
backward. We are going to continue our march forward to make ourselves 
more healthy. We are not going back to the old system, where only a 
little over half the people in this country got cholesterol screening, 
68 percent got colorectal cancer screening.
  We want people to get early screening, early support services for 
preventive care so they stay healthy. Not only is it going to help our 
family budgets, it is going to help our Federal budget if we have 
people healthier and not going to the hospital in the first place. This 
is one of the big aspects of the affordable care act that is not talked 
about a lot. But to me it is one of the most important aspects of 
moving us, again, to a society where we are not just relying on people 
going to the hospital and paying for high hospital bills and things 
such as that in the future.
  I am going to yield the floor. I just wanted to make those comments 
about one aspect of the affordable care act. Of course, we do know 
there are many other benefits in the affordable care act people do not 
want to lose. Right now, we ban lifetime limits, which helps more than 
100 million people. They want to take that away. Republicans want to 
take that away. We cover vital preventive services, which I just went 
over; young people remaining on their parents' coverage up to age 26--
more than 2.5 million helped so far. Republicans want to take that 
away. They want to end all that. I do not think the American people 
want to end it. I think the American people want to move forward with 
health care reform because we have made too much progress--too much 
progress in making sure health insurance is affordable, available.
  I guess I have just one more thing to say, if my friend from Rhode 
Island will let me.
  Everyone in this Senate body belongs to the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits Program. Do you know what. We have coverage for preexisting 
conditions. We have no lifetime bans in our policies. Yet that is what 
we did. Remember the debate? We wanted to say to the American people: 
Whatever we have, we want you to have too. We put that in the 
affordable care act.
  The Republicans say: We are going to take that away from the American 
people but keep it for ourselves. I do not think so. I do not think so. 
I do not think the American people want to say: You Senators and you 
Congressmen can keep all that, but you can take it away from all of us. 
We are not going to do it. We are not going to go backward.
  I yield the floor for my distinguished friend from Rhode Island who 
played such a pivotal role in getting the affordable care act through 
on our committee and has been one of the more eloquent spokespersons on 
this health care bill in the last couple years.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Rhode Island.

         PASSAGE OF PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, in these hallowed 
Halls, we have the power to do many things. At times, it might appear 
as if there is no riddle so complex that the careful arrangement of 
words on a paper cannot overcome it. Indeed, the very rationale behind 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act was to

[[Page H2889]]

solve forever the Gordian knot of equality in our citizens' access to 
health care. Yet, for all its words, commands, prescriptions, and 
boards in the bill, Richard Foster, the chief actuary of CMS, has laid 
bare an essential truth about these mandates. Mr. Speaker, they have 
consequences. On page 10 of his recent report, Mr. Foster states 
unequivocally that this bill will make hospitals, long-term care 
facilities, and other part A providers unprofitable.
  It's clear to me, Mr. Speaker, that while we in Washington can pass 
words on paper that guarantee all Americans health care, that the 
doctors and hospitals throughout America may not be around long enough 
to provide them care. More jobs, Mr. Speaker, lost to wrong-headed 
policies being forced upon the American people by this majority.

 CMS CHIEF ACTUARY'S ANALYSIS ON EFFECTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND 
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. WALDEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House told the National 
Association of Counties a while back that Congress needed to pass the 
health care bill so we could find out what's in it. Well, we are 
finding out now.
  The Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
is the independent scorekeeper of legislation like this. Their report 
that they just issued said half of all seniors in America who are on 
Medicare Advantage plans, half, are going to lose that coverage under 
the bill that was signed into law.
  Well, that's a big problem for seniors in Oregon. Oregon has had one 
of the highest penetration rates in the United States of seniors who 
wanted Medicare Advantage and signed up for it. I was out in Ontario, 
Oregon, not long ago, and the seniors there raised their hands and 
said, ``Why are they taking away the Medicare Advantage I have?'' We 
now know under this independent evaluation half of them will lose that 
care, 38,000 seniors in my district alone.
  We need to repeal and replace this law that was jammed through this 
Congress, Mr. Speaker.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Massie). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 3, 2013, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Castro) for 30 minutes.


                             General Leave

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to talk about 
the Affordable Care Act, about some of its milestones and the benefits 
to the people of the United States, also about some of the critiques 
that have come up over the last few years and in the last few months.
  The Affordable Care Act has succeeded in doing a few things. The 
United States, for a long time, has been the wealthiest nation on 
Earth; however, millions and millions of Americans, despite our 
country's wealth, have been unable to get health care insurance. Many 
folks have suffered a very long time, either themselves or their family 
members, in not being able to see a doctor when they have needed to and 
in being kicked off of insurance because they have hit lifetime caps. 
College students have gone without insurance for years because they 
could no longer stay on their parents' plans.
  There was, I know, a discussion earlier on the floor--I think during 
the lunch hour--and there was a question raised by one of the 
Republican Members. Essentially, his question was: What has the 
Affordable Care Act done?

                              {time}  1800

  Well, there are several concrete things that it has done for the 
United States. The first is that 3 million students have been able to 
stay on their parents' insurance plans, where they otherwise would have 
been kicked off before. The average age where students were kicked off 
before was about 19. Under the Affordable Care Act, millions of college 
students can now stay on until the age of 26.
  We know this number--5 million people, so far, and growing--have 
signed up for health care through the exchanges. Five million people. 
That is very significant. That number continues to grow, as some of the 
busiest days for the health care Web site and for the call-in number 
have been over the last few weeks.
  Also, 4.4 million Americans have signed up for health care through 
Medicaid. They have been covered through Medicaid expansion.
  We can talk about the fact that some States have decided not to 
expand Medicaid. So millions of these people, including in my home 
State of Texas, low-income Americans, most of these people going to 
work every day, working hard to support themselves and their family 
members who are still low-income Americans, but because the State 
governments have not expanded Medicaid in many States, they have not 
been able to get covered. So we are going to talk about that.
  Another issue I want to talk a little bit about is something that is 
very significant for millions and millions of Americans, and that is 
mental health parity with physical health.
  For years, we tried in State legislatures--I know I tried in Texas, 
as well as people across the United States--to make sure that mental 
health issues are covered by insurance in the same way that you would 
cover a broken arm or broken leg or even cancer. Millions of Americans 
suffer from anxiety, depression, and a slew of mental health issues. 
Previously, they were unable to get covered.
  So those are some of the issues that we are going to talk about this 
evening.
  I now yield to my good friend Congressman, Gene Green from Texas.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. First of all, I thank my colleague from San 
Antonio. We are both Texans, and we know the problems. You served a lot 
of years in the State legislature. I did, too. Frankly, I think a lot 
of our problems could have been dealt with if Texas would have expanded 
Medicaid. We are actually giving back money to the Federal Government 
and not covering children and families in our community because of 
that.
  Frankly, even with the problems with the rollout of the Affordable 
Care Act, I know some States have done a great job, like Kentucky and 
California. Some States haven't. But I would think that if Texas did 
their own exchange, we could be the ones making those decisions, I 
think particularly with the Medicaid expansion.
  I appreciate you asking for the Special Order tonight because we are 
coming down up to the deadline of March 31. In fact, I have to do a 
commercial first.
  A lot of us have done these events on how people can sign up for the 
Affordable Care Act. I have one that we are sponsoring this Saturday at 
the Harris County Department of Education building. It is at 6300 
Irvington Boulevard in our district. I am partnering with some of your 
former colleagues: State Representative Armando Walle; State 
Representative Jessica Farrar; our relatively new State senator, Sylvia 
Garcia; and our city council member, Ed Gonzalez. We are doing that 
this Saturday from 9 to 1 so people can come in and sign up.
  The success, though, is that the Web site was down for 2 months, but 
we have seen a huge number of people signing up--5 million as of last 
week. I hear on Monday of this week they had 1 million contacts, both 
by phone and to the Web site.
  So there is a need out there for the Affordable Care Act. It is 
landmark health care reform.
  I was on the subcommittee and the Committee of Energy and Commerce to 
help draft part of it. We did days and nights of drafting amendments. 
We had both bipartisan amendments adopted, including one on mental 
health that Congressman Murphy from Pennsylvania and I had worked out 
to expand mental health coverage.
  Of course, we live in a bicameral Congress and sometimes the Senate 
doesn't always do what we would like

[[Page H2691]]

to do on the House side. That is the nature of it. But the Affordable 
Care Act is expanding health care access.
  You mentioned some of the successes that we have. I know as a State 
legislator I would have loved to have a State law that required 
insurance companies to pay 80 percent of their premiums they received 
back as benefits. I don't know of any State that does that. I would 
have loved to have that in Texas.
  Somebody who pays an insurance premium, whether it is employer health 
care or an individual health policy, they can be guaranteed that 80 
percent of their premium will come back in benefits. That is what the 
Federal law is.
  We hear our Republican colleagues say they still haven't come up to 
an alternative to the Affordable Care Act--because they can't.
  That is one of the successes in there, and there are a lot of 
successes. In fact, some of that law is actually Republican ideas that 
have been built up over the last 20 or 30 years, saying, How can we 
cover the uninsured in our country?
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That is right.
  Congressman, once upon a time, these were the ideas of the Heritage 
Foundation. This was a conservative movement, conservative ideas, about 
how folks would take individual responsibility. Because, as you know, 
being in Harris County, our large hospitals systems end up with 
millions of dollars in uncompensated care every year.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Our Harris County Hospital district is our 
catchment. But not all counties in the State of Texas have that option 
to have a hospital district.
  Even in our area, I have a district that is one of the highest in the 
country of people who work who don't get insurance through their 
employer. That is why the Affordable Care Act is important. In our 
district, we have an estimated 261,000 people who would have the 
opportunity to get health care through the Affordable Care Act. And we 
are hoping to sign them up. We started in November, and we have had 
these workshops literally all over our district, in partnership with 
lots of different groups.
  The Affordable Care Act is particularly important in our districts 
because we have one of the highest rates in the country of people who 
are uninsured. It is essential people know that the financial 
assistance is available under the Affordable Care Act that can lower 
their health care costs. In fact, nearly 6 of the 10 uninsured people 
will find that they can find health coverage for $100 or less a month.
  Like I said, this Saturday we are having a forum. This forum is a 
great opportunity for people to come and actually learn about health 
care options, because health care insurance is important.
  After World War II, our country made a decision. The countries we 
rebuilt in Western Europe had government-run insurance. Canada has 
government-run insurance. Our country decided to go with employer-based 
insurance. And that worked well up until about 10 or 12 years ago, 
where we started seeing employers drop that coverage.

  At one time in our country, 80 percent of the people who worked had 
insurance through their employer. Now it is below 60 percent, and it is 
getting worse. Although with the Affordable Care Act, we are actually 
seeing increases. Because even a small business can be eligible for 
subsidies to cover their employees under the Affordable Care Act.
  Like I said, as a member the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am 
proud of us passing something. It is not perfect, but it is a step in 
the right direction. I would hope that this Congress and maybe a future 
Congress can say, Okay, let's see what is wrong with the Affordable 
Care Act. It is just like we had to go back and fix Medicare on a 
number of occasions.
  Nobody wants to abolish Medicare. It is one of the greatest pieces of 
legislation that we have ever passed. I would hope that over the years 
we would not only build on the Affordable Care Act to make people--just 
like with Medicare--know that they don't have to worry about putting 
their families in bankruptcy because they have an illness. The 
Affordable Care Act will help us on the road to protect that.
  I appreciate your leadership tonight on this. I know I have a 
colleague from California from my class who is up next. I thank you for 
your time.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congressman.
  A few things that you pointed out that I think are especially 
noteworthy. The first is that there is no perfect bill that we pass 
here. And especially, the larger the bill is, the more you are going to 
have to come back and change it and tweak it. That is what you have 
seen with the Affordable Care Act. So there is no surprise that we are 
going to have to have some changes to it. Quite frankly, there have 
been some changes in deadlines. There have been some other changes. 
Americans rightly ask, Well, why is the President or the administration 
doing that?
  Well, it is very simple. Last year, for example, Congress passed the 
least amount of legislation of any year on record. The President is 
taking action to improve the law because the Congress will not or 
cannot. Somebody has got to be doing something here in Washington. 
Unfortunately, in the House of Representatives, we have hit a 
standstill. So the administration is making sure and listening to 
Americans and making the changes that are necessary.
  No bill is ever going to be perfect. Social Security was deeply 
criticized when it was enacted. For several years, Medicare was deeply 
criticized when it was enacted.
  So this is no surprise. Americans in previous generations have seen 
this before, have lived through this before, and this program has been 
a successful one. It will be even more successful as we go forward, and 
we will continue to talk a bit about some of the benefits to millions 
of Americans.
  Before I yield to my colleague from California, Lucille Roybal-
Allard, I want to point out that there are a few ways people can get 
information and sign up. We have been talking a lot about the Web site 
and asking people to go online, but there is also the traditional 
method.
  We have the online Web site at healthcare.gov, of course. Also, by 
mail. You can download an application and send it in by mail. You can 
go in person here. You can also call by phone at 1-800-318-2596. I know 
there has been a lot of emphasis on the Web site, but you can also 
enroll by these traditional methods. That means a lot to a lot of folks 
in different communities.
  I was at an enrollment fair on Saturday, and there was a woman who 
looked to be somewhere between 55 and 60. Quite honestly, she was a bit 
baffled by having to get on the computer, even thought she was being 
assisted, and she asked, Is there another way I can do it where I don't 
have to use a computer? The answer to that is yes, there are 
traditional methods.
  With that, I want to yield to Congresswoman Roybal-Allard from the 
wonderful city of Los Angeles.
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for 
organizing tonight's Special Order on the Affordable Care Act, which is 
helping to make health care a reality for millions of Americans across 
our Nation.
  Luckily, California is one of the States that has a plan. It has 
bought into the Affordable Care Act. As a result, thousands of 
California are now benefiting from what we in California call Covered 
California, which is the ACA plan there.
  By enrolling in the Affordable Care Act, parents and their children 
no longer have to endure illnesses or painful injuries because they 
can't afford a doctor. Parent don't have to worry about their children 
getting a preventable illness because they can't afford to have them 
vaccinated or treated for a chronic preventable disease.
  Why? Because under the ACA, many immunizations and preventative 
services are free.
  Seniors and adults are also eligible for free preventive services, 
including annual checkups, annual mammograms, prostate cancer 
screenings, and immunizations. Young adults, including 435,000 young 
Californians, don't have to worry about being a burden on their family 
if they get sick or are in an accident because they can remain on their 
parents' insurance until age 26, and get affordable insurance after 
that.
  Also critical is the fact that under the Affordable Care Act, no one 
can be

[[Page H2692]]

denied health care coverage because of a preexisting condition.
  The ACA is a wonderful opportunity, as you have pointed out, for 
uninsured Americans to get the health care that they need to improve 
the quality of life for themselves and for that of their family. And I 
would like to just give one example of that.
  A constituent of mine from the city of Bell by the name of Roberto 
Rivas is in his mid-twenties. On December 21, 2013, he arrived at 6 
a.m. to enroll in a health insurance plan before going to work at KFC, 
where he is not offered any health insurance. He is also a full-time 
student at Trade Tech studying chemistry. He would like to use his 
education to study proteins and to research viruses such as hepatitis 
and other infectious diseases.
  Until the age of 21, along with his 10-year-old sister, he was 
covered by his mother under Medi-Cal. When he turned 21, he was no 
longer eligible for Medi-Cal. He lost that insurance and was left 
completely without any health insurance whatsoever.
  Shortly after, he began suffering from breathing problems. He went to 
a doctor and found out that he had pneumonia. Later, after being 
treated for that pneumonia, he received a medical bill for $4,663. He 
had no insurance to cover that. He even asked for charity care services 
to help cover his expenses, but was denied that request.
  Robert said:

       As a minimum wage worker and a full-time student, it is 
     hard to get health insurance.

  Thanks to ObamaCare:

       Now I can go to school and not stress about getting sick 
     and ending up in the hospital.
       I'm calling everybody in my family to tell them I'm 
     enrolled in health care and that they need to come out and 
     get covered, too.

                              {time}  1815

  Robert Rivas was also astounded by the service, the friendly faces, 
and the applause he received when he enrolled; and he says:

       To know so many people actually care about me getting 
     health insurance is great.

  This is just one example of the millions of Americans who are 
benefitting from what we call ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act.
  I am hoping that more Californians who have not applied, and 
Americans across the country who are uninsured and can benefit greatly 
by enrolling in health care, that they don't miss out.
  There are only 5 days left until the enrollment deadline of March 31. 
I hope that, today, they will visit healthcare.gov or use any services 
which you have already outlined to enroll in the Affordable Care Act 
for themselves and for their families.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congresswoman. And what a powerful 
story that you have told. I am glad to hear that California has done 
such an incredible job in making health care available to its 
constituents and to its residents. Thank you.
  I would also point out, Congresswoman Roybal-Allard mentioned 
something that is very significant because Republicans have tried to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act now--I think it is about 51 times--50, 
51 times.
  We make no bones about it. There are a lot of Americans--a decent 
number of Americans who agree with that argument, who say repeal it; 
but let's understand, if your argument is repeal it, then understand 
exactly what you are repealing.
  First, there is no plan that has been offered by the other side--no 
alternative. Also, if you repeal it, what you are saying now is you are 
going to, again, allow insurance companies to kick off cancer patients 
because they hit a lifetime limit, send them out of the hospital, send 
them home.
  You are not going to allow recent college graduates to stay on their 
parents' insurance until they are 26 years old.
  Remember, health care problems and big hospital bills, for years now, 
have been the number one reason for personal bankruptcies. People would 
run out of insurance money.
  They would have to take out all of their savings from their bank 
accounts to pay their hospital bills; and then, they could no longer 
make their mortgage payment, their car payment. They couldn't help 
their kids go to college. They essentially became broke.
  If you are talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act, then you 
have to accept and be upfront about the kind of future that you are 
inviting, which is a travel back to the past.
  I have been surprised in my time here that Republicans have tried to 
repeal this law 51 times, and what is more surprising is that there is 
no alternative plan to the Affordable Care Act.
  That is why, in the surveys, you see over 60 percent of Americans 
that say: Yeah, I may have an issue with it. I didn't like the way the 
Web site was done. I disagree with some parts of it, but I don't want 
it repealed. I want it improved.
  Unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, the strategy has not 
been to improve this thing and work with us to make it better. Like I 
said, any big law--any big law--whether it is about health care or 
mortgages or financial services or anything, any big law is going to 
require some tweaks and some changes.
  So I hope that they will listen to the voice of Americans and take a 
different tack.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Cardenas).
  Mr. CARDENAS. I thank my good friend from San Antonio, Texas.
  Congressman Castro, you are absolutely right. To go back away from 
the Affordable Care Act means to go back to the old system, and the old 
system is not the good old days.
  When we are looking at families who are fortunate to even have 
insurance, their insurance is going up seven to 17 percent, year over 
year over year. That is unsustainable.
  People's income does not go up that high, that fast. People's 
opportunity to find other ways to find that money somewhere else in 
their budget doesn't go up that fast, so those were not the good old 
days. Actually, the best days are yet to come.
  What we have seen 52 times here is an opportunity--or a tried 
opportunity to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, and by calling it by 
another name doesn't make it bad.
  Yes, the rollout could have happened better, but the bottom line is 
the good days are yet to come. They are here now. The past are not the 
good old days.
  I would like to thank you for this opportunity to speak. I think it 
is important for us to understand that what we are talking about here 
is high quality affordable health care, which is something that was 
denied and out of reach for so many seniors and families in my district 
in the San Fernando Valley and across the country.
  One in three people in my district were uninsured, but Covered 
California is giving those people the opportunity to purchase 
affordable plans that will give them the care they need when they get 
sick and the preventative services they will need to stay healthy.
  While the rollout of the Affordable Care Act hasn't been perfect, 
Covered California has been very successful in providing a simple, 
straightforward way to enroll.
  I feel really bad for those States where their State legislatures and 
their Republican Representatives have denied them the opportunity to 
experience good affordable health care. I hope that they can catch up.
  Last week, Covered California announced that they had enrolled over 1 
million people through the State-run exchange. That is in California 
alone. Their critical work has helped hundreds of thousands of 
California families, seniors, small businesses to gain access to high 
quality affordable health care that was once denied to them for too 
long.
  My staff and I have been working alongside Covered California to help 
enroll residents in the San Fernando Valley. Over the last few months, 
I have been hosting a series of successful enrollment workshops for the 
Affordable Care Act; and as a matter of fact, we will reach 30 events 
by this weekend.
  This is where families learn about the options available to them 
under the new health care law, including learning about insurance 
policies that can be purchased through the Covered California health 
insurance exchange, which has been successful in getting folks 
enrolled.
  More than 500 families have taken advantage of these workshops just 
in my district alone.
  Wow. Can you imagine, Congressman Castro, if every single one of the 
435 Congressional Members rolled up their sleeves and helped people get 
enrolled?

[[Page H2693]]

That would be millions upon millions of more American families that 
would be enrolled in affordable health care.
  In the last week before the deadline, every Representative should 
take this opportunity to do the same job that we have been able to do 
in my district. We must help families sign up for the Affordable Health 
Care Act.
  The day will come very soon when the truth will overcome the lies 
that have scared so many people. Billions of dollars have been spent 
scaring people away from trying to even enroll in the Affordable Care 
Act.
  Let me give you an example. I have met with parents who have come to 
workshops to sign up, and they have anxiety and fear in their eyes; but 
thank God, just moments later, their fears go away when they find out 
that they now have affordable, reliable health care.
  People with mild asthma that were once denied health care can no 
longer be discriminated against. They are no longer denied health care, 
and they can breathe easy knowing that they can now see a doctor, and 
they can actually get the medicines that they need just to breathe.
  I met with a gentleman who was sitting there with his wife and his 
daughter, the sole income earner for that family. I don't know how he 
does it, but with $9 an hour, he manages to feed a family of three; and 
he was worried that he couldn't afford maybe $30, $40, $50 a month.
  When the person turned the computer around and showed him what his 
eligibility was, he almost came to tears, realizing that, once and for 
all, himself, his wife, and his teenage daughter can now have health 
care.
  I will tell you what. This is serious business. America, it is time 
that you sign up for affordable health care. Just try it. Don't worry; 
be happy.
  Sign up for the insurance that you deserve.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congressman Cardenas. Thank you for 
all of your work.
  You also raise a great point, which is folks will often see the 
sticker price of the insurance on the exchanges.
  By the way, I, as well as many other Members of Congress, bought our 
insurance off of the exchanges. We were getting asked that question a 
lot. You know, are you going to buy ObamaCare?
  The answer is yes. I bought my insurance off the exchanges, and I 
saved money.
  Folks should make sure that they also check, besides the sticker 
price, what kind of subsidy they get because it is meant to make 
insurance affordable for middle class Americans and others.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle 
Lujan Grisham).
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Thank you very much, 
Congressman Joaquin Castro.
  Muchas gracias, al congresista Joaquin Castro.
  Thank you so much for calling us together to talk about this 
critically important issue for our families.
  Twenty years ago, when I was running the New Mexico Department on 
Aging, I remember an incredibly tragic call from a family of a 60-year-
old woman who had fallen and broken her hip. She was in a hospital in 
Albuquerque.
  Now, of course, hospitals are required to provide stabilizing 
emergency treatment and even surgery if that is required in that 
instance; but unfortunately, this 60-year-old woman didn't have 
insurance, and she was rolled out of the hospital in a wheelchair 
without the required surgery for her hip fracture.
  If the Affordable Care Act was in place when this happened, this 60-
year-old woman could have simply provided her health insurance card to 
someone at the hospital, and the hospital would have stabilized her 
hip, performed the surgery, and then provided follow-up rehabilitation 
care. This would allow this woman to walk again.
  The required stabilization is critical for successful recovery of 
that particular hip injury, and the long-term consequences of not 
receiving the care, in addition to the pain and suffering of this 
woman, are significant. Quite frankly, she would never have walked 
again without that surgery.
  Now, thankfully, in her case, the whole community came together to 
gather enough money to pay for her treatment; but if this were to 
happen today, she could have already purchased subsidized insurance in 
the health insurance marketplace or qualified for Medicaid, and she 
would have been able to receive treatment without the scare and the 
subsequent fundraising by her family in that instance.
  People across the country face situations like this every single day. 
That is why it is critical that we tell our friends and neighbors that 
they only have 5 days left to enroll in health insurance through the 
marketplace--5 days. There is absolutely no time to waste.
  Like many of my colleagues, I have been working with groups in my 
district and have been participating in enrollment events to help 
provide information and to assist New Mexicans to enroll.
  Two of my constituents, Mark and Elizabeth Horst from Albuquerque, 
signed up for bronze plans through the exchange last fall. They make 
$24,000 a year between them and have qualified for $612 in subsidies, 
which covers the cost of the bronze plan.
  Thousands more New Mexicans are still eligible. New Mexico had the 
third highest uninsured of any State before the Affordable Care Act 
went into effect this year. In the Hispanic community, more than 25 
percent are uninsured, and more than that are underinsured.
  Today, more than 360,000 in New Mexico are still eligible for 
enrollment. By enrolling in a plan, you don't have to risk injury or a 
lifetime of debt. You can get your family covered; and, by having 
access to primary care, your family can stay healthier longer.
  I appreciate my colleague's effort today. I thank you very much.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congresswoman.
  We only have a few minutes left, and I would like to yield to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).
  Mr. DOGGETT. I would just like to thank you for the work that you are 
doing on this, and I believe our real message is to the many people out 
there--some of whom may even think that this law has been repealed. 
They have tried so many times.
  As you pointed out a little earlier, this is an opportunity that is 
there for the next 5 days. Get beyond all the political chatter. Turn 
to a group like the American Cancer Society or the American Diabetes 
Association. Look at the information that is there.
  Then go to one of the many enrollment fairs we are having across San 
Antonio this weekend. There is one up in Austin that is going to go 
almost 24 hours straight. These are opportunities to get out and do 
this.
  I know you had a very successful enrollment fair in San Antonio. I 
had one over at Progreso Hall. Our colleague, Pete Gallego, had one out 
at Palo Alto. These have been opportunities for a wide range of our 
neighbors to come out and participate. We just want to encourage them 
to do more.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congressman Doggett, and thank you 
for your work when this bill was being worked on and drafted. Thank you 
for helping to pass it and, since then, passionately making sure that 
people get on to the ACA.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I think, if we keep working together, we can find ways 
to strengthen and improve this, but the main thing is for our families 
to get out there now.
  I think, increasingly, most folks are realizing, as you pointed out, 
with so many efforts to repeal, that the only alternative that they 
offer is ``Nothing Care.''
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.

[Pages H1722-H1723]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, all things are subject to interpretation, 
but as Nietzsche once said:

       Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is often 
     more a function of power and not truth.

  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office came out with a report 
evaluating the economic impacts of the Affordable Care Act. Since then, 
there are those who have used the power they have to frame a false 
narrative. Rather than talking about what the report actually says, 
they have spent the last week talking about what they would like it to 
say. Their false interpretation of the ObamaCare act is that it will 
cost the American economy 2.5 million jobs; but the truth is that the 
much-misrepresented CBO study didn't say that at all because, as The 
Wall Street Journal accurately reported, reducing the total number of 
hours Americans have to work is very different than eliminating jobs.
  One of the reasons we passed the Affordable Care Act in the first 
place was to fix the pitfalls of this country's employer-based health 
care system. Before the ACA, people with preexisting conditions were 
often forced to stay in their jobs to avoid losing their health care 
coverage. Even if they wanted to leave their jobs to reduce their 
hours, retire early, change careers, or to spend more time with their 
families, they couldn't because doing so would risk their ability to 
provide affordable health insurance for their families.

                              {time}  1015

  What the Affordable Care Act did was right this wrong. By broadening 
access to health insurance, the ACA has increased personal freedom and 
market choice. Now Americans can choose jobs based on what they want to 
be doing instead of staying where they are unhappy just to keep their 
insurance.
  The expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the subsidies available in 
the exchanges will give Americans the flexibility they need to raise 
their families, not encourage workers to seek less employment, which 
was one of the most misleading claims made after the report was 
released.
  The idea that hardworking Americans will modify their employment just 
to be eligible for social safety net programs is both ludicrous and 
offensive. Nobody wants to live in a situation that makes you eligible 
for Medicaid or other social safety net programs, but too many 
hardworking Americans are forced to.
  In Illinois, a family of four must exist on less than $32,500 per 
year to qualify for these programs. In the Chicago area, the cost of 
living is high and families struggle to make ends meet.
  Measures like Medicaid and SNAP are meant to help people lift 
themselves from poverty. Claiming that poor people want to be poor to 
rely more on the government is misguided and just flat out wrong.
  I have said from the beginning that the ACA is far from perfect and 
that we should work together to improve it, but arguing that at-risk 
and low-income Americans will actively choose to work less, reducing 
their own incomes and jeopardizing their family's economic future just 
to ``game the system,'' is not a legitimate issue and speaks volumes 
about the extreme views that are dividing our government and preventing 
real reform from occurring.
  By focusing on false interpretations, we are forgetting the economic 
benefits contained in the law. To quote the CBO report:

       If some people seek to work less, other applicants will be 
     readily available to fill those positions and the overall 
     effect on employment will be muted.

  At a time when long-term employment is at its highest since World War 
II, there are more than enough workers willing and able to take these 
jobs. That is why the director of the CBO recently testified about the 
likelihood of the ACA creating jobs, not eliminating them.
  The report also acknowledged that insurance premiums under the law 
are 15 percent lower than originally forecast, that ``the slowdown in 
Medicare cost growth'' is ``broad and persistent,''

[[Page H1723]]

and that enrollments will increase over time to where they would have 
been if not for the Web site's issues.
  Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans 
can now access affordable health insurance. With a focus on personal 
responsibility, preventive care, consumer protections, and increased 
choices, the Affordable Care Act has helped empower Americans to lead 
healthier lives.
  Let's put aside the punditry and focus on the facts.

     MARCH 20, 2012--SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in the same spot where I was 
about 2 years ago, March 23, 2010, to celebrate the passage of one of 
the most important acts that this body has ever passed: the Affordable 
Care Act.
  On March 23, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of that 
landmark decision. Of course, next week the Supreme Court will hear 
arguments on whether the individual mandate is permissible or not. Let 
us hope that the Supreme Court will act according to the law.

[[Page H1396]]

  The Affordable Care Act will change the landscape of our Nation's 
health care delivery system for the better. I hosted a telephone town 
hall last night with my constituents on the Affordable Care Act and was 
joined by the Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, Bill Corr, 
to answer questions from folks in my district about how it will affect 
them.
  We listened to comments and stories about people who have been in the 
doughnut hole, seniors, that cost them a lot of money. We told them 
about the fact some of them knew that once they go into the doughnut 
hole--after they spend about $2,500 or $2,700 and up to about $5,000 
you go into that hole--that the moneys will be paid for, for generic 
drugs, with a 50 percent discount because of the Affordable Care Act. 
That is extremely important for citizens and others with high drug 
prices.
  Children will be able to stay on their parents' insurance, if they 
choose to, up to the age of 26, which didn't happen before; and that's 
so important for young people and for parents to know the security that 
their children will be insured if they have a health care crisis.
  Doctors will be able to see seniors for preventative care without 
cost. That's happening right now for those on Medicare and will happen 
for everybody in 2014 when the law goes into effect for all--
mammograms, colonoscopies, shots for children, vaccinations, et cetera.
  The insurance companies will no longer be able to have lifetime 
limits on how much people can use their insurance in case of illness.
  There will be a consumer-friendly exchange where you can shop for 
prices for insurance and compare insurance policies to get what's best 
for you.
  You can't arbitrarily be dropped from coverage by your insurance 
company simply because you get sick, and preexisting conditions will no 
longer be a basis to deny somebody insurance. Already today, for 
children up to the age of 19, preexisting conditions cannot stop you 
from getting insurance.
  I had polio when I was a child. I would not like to think of any 
child that gets an illness such as that today, whether it be diabetes 
or cancer or any other illness, to be denied insurance because of a 
preexisting condition. That, because of the Affordable Care Act, will 
not occur in the future in this country.
  Insurance companies have taken people off of insurance because 
they've used too much in a year or too much in a lifetime, and that's 
going to stop.
  The idea of getting preventative care, which Medicare provides now 
and all will have in the future, will lead to lower health care costs 
because, if you catch illnesses early, it's much more cost efficient to 
treat them, and lives will be saved as well.
  Insurance companies are required to spend at least 80 percent of 
their moneys on treating patients, not on executive pay, advertising, 
administrative costs, or other such costs to the consumer; and if they 
go over that in any way whatsoever, the consumer will get a rebate. 
Insurance companies must now publish justifications for any premium 
increases they are seeking of more than 10 percent on the Internet, and 
outside experts will evaluate whether those increases are justified. 
The consumer will be protected.
  The doughnut hole ending, which I talked about earlier, has helped 
3.6 million seniors receive discounts of $2.1 billion, each senior 
saving an average of $604.
  The preventative care services I mentioned under Medicare, 32.5 
million seniors have already received one or more of those preventative 
services; and youngsters have received them as well because they get 
preventative care in their vaccinations without having to have a copay, 
which might stop their parent from taking them to the doctor to get 
those vaccinations which can prevent illnesses later.
  Seniors are now receiving free annual wellness visits under Medicare, 
and 2.3 million seniors in traditional Medicare have already taken 
advantage of the new annual wellness visit.
  Young adults stay on their insurance, as I mentioned; 2.5 million 
additional young people have gained insurance over the last year.
  Paul Krugman wrote in yesterday's New York Times that what is called 
by the Republican Party ObamaCare--which really, if you think about it, 
is a good thing, Obama cares, but it's not intended to be by them as, 
really, Obama-RomneyCare, because the plan we adopted is based upon 
what Mitt Romney did in Massachusetts to make sure that the people of 
Massachusetts bought insurance and the burden was shared in an 
appropriate way.
  Thank you, Mitt Romney. Thank you, President Obama. Thank you, United 
States American Congress.

                   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPEAL EFFORTS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the passage and implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act is the culmination of an American political journey 
that started a century ago with Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 with the Bull 
Moose Party--also a Republican--and picked up years later by Harry 
Truman and other Presidents, including Richard Nixon, another 
Republican. The most recent groundwork for reform was laid in part by 
the former Republican Presidential candidate, Robert Dole, as an 
alternative to Hillary Clinton's plan, and by the present Republican 
Presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. I commend them for championing the 
concept of the individual mandate back when it wasn't quite as 
unpopular on their side of the aisle.
  The history of reforming our Nation's health care system is a strong 
one that has historically been championed by lawmakers on both sides of 
the political spectrum, until this Congress. My colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have wasted hours upon hours debating and voting upon 
the various versions of the legislation that would repeal the 
Affordable Care Act.
  My colleagues know that these initiatives are fruitless. They know 
that voting over and over and over again--more than 30 times total--on 
measures to repeal the Affordable Care Act is a waste of time, but they 
keep calling for these votes. Do you want to know why? Because they 
want to distract the American public from the fact that they are so 
committed to unseating our President, Barack Obama, that they haven't 
passed any effective jobs-creating legislation since they took over the 
majority in this House in 2010.
  The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality 
of the Affordable Care Act, and it's time to face the facts. Earlier 
today, a gentleman from Virginia said, Oh, it was just 5-4. Bush v. 
Gore was 5-4. We accepted that the person who got the least votes and 
lost Florida was President of the United States for 8 years, but the 
consequences we still have to face.
  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. As a result, millions 
of Americans who were previously uninsured or underinsured have access 
to affordable, high-quality health care. In fact, the number of 
Americans uninsured is equal to the population of 25 of the 50 States.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans and small 
businesses have already benefited from lower health care costs, 
increased access to preventive care, and stronger patient protections.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 12.8 million families will receive 
rebates that total over $1 billion from insurers next month, in August, 
because the law requires companies to provide value for their premium 
dollar. Never before has that happened.
  Community health centers in my district have received over $10 
million to deliver health care services to underserved and impoverished 
Memphians, and 170,000 households in my district will get a premium 
credit so they can afford quality health insurance coverage.
  Women no longer are considered a preexisting condition, and insurance 
companies can't charge them more, which they did, by 40 percent.
  Medicare beneficiaries now have access to preventive care and 
services without any copay.
  And 64,000 people in my district will go from uninsured to insured.
  32.5 million seniors nationwide received one or more preventive care 
treatments in 2011.
  The doughnut hole is being closed; 50 percent discounts on covered 
brand-name generics.
  Annual and lifetime caps on health care coverage are now illegal, 
meaning insurance companies can't kick you off the plan just because 
you get cancer or are in an accident or have a heart attack.
  Our children are now protected because insurers are prevented from 
denying coverage to children under 19 for preexisting conditions. This 
means up to 17 million children with preexisting conditions are now 
protected from discrimination.
  Young adults can remain on their parents' insurance until they're 26, 
providing some protection in this uncertain job market.

                              {time}  1050

  It's now affordable for small businesses to provide insurance to 
employees. The tax credits cover up to 35 percent of the cost of 
coverage and will go up to 50 percent in 2014. In fact, in 2011, 
360,000 small employers used the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit 
to help them afford health insurance for 2 million workers.
  One of the most misleading arguments by my colleagues concerns that 
penalty that will be assessed on those financially-able Americans who 
choose not to purchase insurance, thereby not taking responsibility for 
their health care. Responsibility. That's one of the keynotes of the 
Republican side.
  But if an uninsured person in my district gets into a car accident or 
comes down with an aggressive illness, they're taken to a public 
hospital in Memphis called The MED. The MED treats everybody because 
they have to, and when The MED takes cares of those people, the 
property owners, the responsible people, pay for it through higher 
property taxes, or you pay for it with your insurance, if you have it, 
because it's uncompensated care if you go to a non-public hospital.
  The time and effort put in by nurses and doctors and assistants at 
The MED aren't free. The medical devices and supplies that The MED used 
to treat those uninsured people aren't free. Every single resident of 
Shelby County pays for those services when a person seeks emergency 
services there, and the taxes go up.
  People who choose not to buy insurance for themselves and their 
families, even with the Federal Government providing incentives and 
credits, are irresponsible free riders, and it's the free riders that 
the other side's trying to talk about, not the conscientious and 
responsible people who take control of their own lives and their own 
destinies.
  Not taking responsibility for the health of yourself and your family 
is reckless. The free riders have been a burden on our national health 
care system for far too long, and it's time they take responsibility 
for their actions and their health. This penalty, which will be equal 
to no more than the estimated cost of an insurance premium, is the way 
we do it.
  It's long past time we implement the health reform initiated by Teddy 
Roosevelt and championed by people of both parties. It's time Americans 
realize and take advantage of their right to quality healthcare. And 
it's long past time my colleagues stop playing partisan politics and 
start working on behalf of the American people, not giant corporations, 
once again.

                THE HIGH COST OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I received an email from 
Scott, a constituent of the 5th District who lives in Boone, North 
Carolina. Here is what he had to say:

       With all of the talk to this point about the effects of the 
     Affordable Care Act, it has just turned into brutal reality 
     for me and my family. I received a letter from Blue Cross 
     Blue Shield this week regarding my coverage. All of the 
     promises of if you like your current health coverage, you 
     will be able to keep it is absolutely untrue. Blue Cross has 
     dropped my current plan that I was relatively happy with and 
     was expecting to continue using. Blue Cross will be moving me 
     into a new plan where the cost is devastating for my family. 
     My monthly premium is increasing 55 percent, $3,816 more per 
     year, and my out-of-pocket expenses will cost my family an 
     additional $3,650 per year. So, all in all, I will be paying 
     an additional $7,466 next year for health insurance and 
     copayments on top of my already high premiums. I do not 
     qualify for any of the subsidies either, so this one is all 
     on the back of this middle class family of four. I have a 4-
     year-old daughter and a 2-year-old daughter. I have no choice 
     but to keep them covered any way I can as any father would. 
     But the new outlays of $7,466 will be a huge burden. We will

[[Page H6460]]

     all have to make some big changes in our family to be able to 
     afford this. I knew the Affordable Care Act would be tough on 
     someone like myself, but I had no idea how hard it would hit 
     me and my family.

  Mr. Speaker, Scott is not alone. Families across this country are 
baffled by ObamaCare sticker shock. Accepting the devastating truth 
that costs will be much higher for them next year, some families are 
trying to find a way to make it work, but they can't even get to the 
Web site.
  But what do they hear from Washington? ObamaCare apologists say, Be 
patient with us. We will get these glitches sorted out. It will take a 
few years, and you will all be used to it.
  Mr. Speaker, if only those voices in Washington would be willing to 
give the American people the same time and patience they are demanding. 
A bipartisan House majority has asked for families to have 1 penalty-
free year to figure out what ObamaCare will mean for their families and 
for their budgets, 1 penalty-free year, not unlike the penalty-free 
year the President gave to Big Business all on his own.
  Fairness: that is what we have asked for. Fairness: that is what 
Senate Democrats are refusing to discuss. Fairness: that is what the 
President describes as ransom.

     AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS KILLING THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF AMERICA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, every day now for the past 3 years, I 
have heard from the good people of Georgia's Third Congressional 
District about how expensive their health insurance costs have become 
and will become as a result of ObamaCare. On Tuesday, their fears of 
just how unaffordable this Affordable Care Act is became a truly bleak 
reality to them.
  If this train wreck of a law is truly affordable, then why have 
Georgians seen their premiums increase as much as 300 percent on the 
exchanges? If it is affordable, then why do 57 percent of Americans 
oppose ObamaCare? If this law is affordable, then why is Ruth from 
LaGrange opting to pay the penalty and forgo insurance because she and 
her husband can no longer afford to pay their family's premiums under 
this Affordable Health Care Act? I guess even if Ruth likes her plan, 
she really can't keep it. She was lied to.
  One thing supporters of ObamaCare always tout is that it will help 
those who are very sick or have preexisting conditions get access to 
affordable care. Well, let me tell you about Cindy from Newnan who is 
fighting a brave battle with cancer. Much to her surprise, she has been 
told by her doctor that under the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, some 
of the treatments in medicine that make a difference in her being sick 
just a few days instead of a few weeks will no longer be covered. What 
about someone who does not have a few weeks? What are they supposed to 
do? And how do we explain that to Cindy's children?
  You know it is a sad day when employers like IBM are left with no 
choice but to kick retirees off their health care plans. What a reward 
to those like David of Griffin who have given so many years 
contributing to their company's success.
  And it is not just hurting American families. It is killing small 
businesses, the economic engine of our country. I just got a letter 
from Dale in LaGrange, who is one of four owners of a heating and air 
conditioning company which self-insures their employees.
  In an effort to comply with ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, in 
2011, the heating and air conditioning company saw their health care 
costs go up $38,000 compared to 2010. The same thing happened in 2012. 
Their costs went up almost $40,000 from 2011. This means they went from 
spending $115,000 on health care for their employees in 2010 to almost 
$195,000 just 2 years later.
  What is just as concerning is employers who have been forced by 
ObamaCare to increase their employees' premiums and no longer offer 
health insurance for spouses or children.

                              {time}  1130

  This change has been a financial disaster for Melanie of Hamilton 
whose husband will no longer be covered by her employer, TSYS, a great 
company in my district and a stable source of jobs.
  For 3 years, we have seen the disastrous consequences of this 
supposedly Affordable Care Act, and in just 3 days since the exchanges 
have gone live, we have heard hundreds of stories similar to the ones I 
just told. Imagine how much worse things can become in 3 months.
  But listen, it's not just the lies we have been told, but it's the 
lies we're still being told--such as California reporting they had 5 
million hits. Finally today, they confessed, they only had 655,000.
  As I have said time and time again, the easy solution is for the 
President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join 
House Republicans and agree to a 1-year delay and defund, just like he 
has done delay for Big Business and his buddies. Why don't we do it for 
the American people? Why don't we put all of us in the same class 
rather than trying to divide this country? Why don't we do the delay? 
Give them time, if they can, to straighten out this mess and put 
everybody, small businesses, Americans, everybody, employed and 
unemployed, in the same class.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Gardner) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. Speaker, when the President began his push to pass 
the partisan Affordable Care Act, he did so with two primary promises: 
the promise that if you like your health care plan, you will be able to 
keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away. That was 
the plan that this Chamber voted for when they passed the so-called 
Affordable Care Act. That was the plan the United States Senate voted 
for when they passed the so-called Affordable Care Act: If you like 
your health care, you can keep it.
  In 2011, Richard Foster, the Chief Actuary of Medicare, testified 
before Congress that this promise would not come true, the promise that 
if you liked your health care, if you liked your health insurance plan, 
you would get to keep it. The Chief Actuary of Medicare--he is not a 
Democrat or Republican appointee--said that this promise, the promise 
that was made when this bill passed, won't come true.
  Over the past several months, my office has received countless 
letters, emails, tweets and Facebook comments from people around this 
country and around my district in Colorado who have said thanks to 
ObamaCare they are losing their health insurance, they are losing their 
family's plan. This promise for them is not coming true.
  When I first got elected to Congress, I made a decision that I would 
reject congressional health insurance, that I would reject the Federal 
health care plan, because I wanted to be in the same boat as my 
constituents. Just a couple of weeks ago, I too received a letter in 
the mail from our insurance plan, our private provider, in Colorado for 
our family, and it said this: We notify you about the upcoming 
discontinuation of your plan. This letter right here that says my 
family's plan is being canceled.
  Mr. President, where is the promise? Mr. President, if you like your 
health care plan you'll be able to keep it--tell that to the thousands 
of people in my district who are losing their health insurance, to my 
family, to millions of people around this country for whom this promise 
that you made when you sold this bill is not coming true.
  The plan that my family had was an affordable plan. We shopped for 
it. We worked hard to find a plan that met our needs in rural Colorado. 
We found a plan that is now being canceled. The plan that replaces it--
the plan that replaces it--now increases in cost by over 100 percent. 
In fact, the plan that is most similar to the one we had is now going 
up to $1,480 a month. It is a 100 percent increase from the plan that 
we had.
  But the President said if you had your health insurance that you 
liked, you would get to keep it. The President also said the second 
primary promise, though, was that if you had your plan and you got to 
keep it, we're going to make sure that this bill, the Affordable Care 
Act, brings down your cost. Yet we know that that's not coming true 
either, as people around this country are facing higher insurance 
costs, higher plan costs, canceling their plans, forcing them to go to 
other alternatives.
  In the letter that we received canceling my family's plan it said 
this: that I have options, I have options to purchase another 
individual health plan from us, purchase a plan from another carrier, 
or go through the health care exchange in Colorado, an exchange that 
was just reported in the newspaper to have significant computer 
glitches even though it is supposed to be up and running on October 1. 
But not one of these options, not a single one of these options include 
being able to keep the plan that my family had, despite the President's 
promise, the promise that if you liked your insurance you would be able 
to keep it.
  Mr. President, where is your promise today? Will you explain to the 
American people that neither of those promises--the primary reasons you 
pushed the health care bill--are untrue. Explain that to the American 
people.
  In recent reports we've seen from Forbes an analysis that ObamaCare 
will increase underlying insurance rates for younger men by an average 
of 97 to 99 percent and for women by an average of 55 to 62 percent. 
HHS compared what the Congressional Budget Office projected rates might 
look like in 2016 to its own findings. What happened, of course, in 
this analysis was that premiums, according to Forbes, nationwide will 
be around 16 percent lower. That's what they said. But after the 
analysis, after the analysis by CBO, which looked at the projected 
rates in 2016 compared to its own findings, neither of those numbers 
tell you the statistic that really matters: how much rates will go up 
next year under ObamaCare relative to this year, prior to the law 
taking effect. Looking at families like mine, a 100 percent increase.
  We've received stories from around the district--people who have seen 
their costs increase, people who have seen their insurance canceled. We 
received a message over Twitter that said: I lost my insurance because 
I can't afford the 100 percent cost increase. For the first time in 47 
years I will have to depend on the government for health insurance. 
Another gentleman said he will be dependent on the taxpayers as well 
for the first time in his life.
  Mr. President, explain to the American people why the promises that 
you made, the promises you made to the American people, are simply not 
true.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.

[Pages S2014-S2015]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President Truman once said, ``Healthy 
citizens constitute our greatest national resource.''
  Two years ago last week we passed the affordable care act. We passed 
it to help give every American access to quality affordable health 
care.
  People such as Cece Whitney from Helena, MO, know exactly how much 
help this law provides. Doctors diagnosed Cece with cystic fibrosis by 
age 7. By high school she carried an oxygen tank. By the end of college 
she received a double lung transplant. Even with insurance coverage 
Cece and her family paid tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket. 
But things looked even worse when she hit an arbitrary coverage limit, 
and if she had lost her insurance before health reform she might not 
have been able to find any insurance coverage at all.
  Insurance companies could have turned her away simply because she was 
born with cystic fibrosis. But now, thanks to the affordable care act, 
Cece will always be covered. She will always have access to the care 
she needs.
  A year ago, on the affordable care act's first anniversary, Cece 
shared her story about seeing health reform signed into law with her 
local newspaper. She said she cried tears--tears of extreme joy. She 
wrote:

       I knew that I no longer had to worry about losing or being 
     denied coverage because of my `preexisting condition.' And I 
     no longer was going to be denied coverage for exceeding 
     arbitrary caps set by insurance companies.

  Cece's story is not unique. Health reform is working for people in 
Montana and across the country, and it is saving them money. The law 
improved our health care system and enabled it to focus on prevention 
and keeping Americans healthy. We have reforms to pay for quality of 
care rather than quantity of services. In just 2 years, health reform 
has lowered costs for millions of Americans. Parents can now afford to 
cover their entire family, including children up to the age of 26. More 
than 2.5 million young adults have been able to stay on their parents' 
plan thanks to health reform.
  Prescription drugs are now cheaper for seniors because of the act. 
Already more than 5 million Medicare beneficiaries have saved more than 
$3 billion on drugs. Again, that is $3 billion saved by seniors on 
drugs, and health reform eliminates the so-called Medicare prescription 
drug doughnut hole. This puts dollars back in seniors' pockets--dollars 
they can use for groceries or electricity bills.
  Seniors now receive free annual wellness visits and free screenings. 
This focus on prevention leads to better health outcomes, and it keeps 
them healthier. It saves money by allowing seniors and their doctors to 
catch conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes before they 
become serious and costly.
  Health reform also helps those who wish to retire early to afford 
insurance until they qualify for Medicare. The law has provided almost 
$4.5 billion in aid to businesses to give early-retiree coverage to 
these employees. Let me repeat that. The law has provided almost $4.5 
billion in aid to businesses to enable them to give early-retiree 
coverage for their employees.
  Health reform is also saving Americans money through new consumer 
protections. It is ending insurance company abuses. Medical loss ratios 
is one that comes to my mind. Because of health reform, parents can now 
keep their kids who have preexisting conditions on their plan, and 
insurance companies can no longer exclude these children. Insurance 
companies can no longer place lifetime and restrictive yearly limits on 
their health coverage that can cost Americans such as Cece Whitney tens 
of thousands of dollars, and insurance companies can no longer go back 
and scrutinize applications for tiny errors as a way to deny payments 
after a customer gets sick.
  Health reform has also created the Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
Center to put good ideas from the private sector into action. The 
center is already working with more than 7,100 organizations--
hospitals, physicians, consumer groups, and employers included--to 
reduce costly hospital readmissions.
  Health reform provides law enforcement with new tools and resources 
to protect Medicare and Medicaid from fraud and abuse. These efforts 
recovered more than $4 billion last year. New antifraud provisions in 
the act, in the health care bill, helped recover more than $4 billion 
in fraud last year. Just a few weeks ago, Federal agents made the 
largest Medicare fraud bust in U.S. history. Ninety-one people were 
charged with defrauding taxpayers for nearly $300 million.
  More parts of the affordable care act that will help consumers will 
start in the year 2014, including the State-based affordable insurance 
exchanges. On these exchanges people will be able to save money. How? 
By shopping for an insurance plan that is right for them. It is like 
getting on Expedia or Orbitz: you just get on and shop around and find 
the one that is best for you.
  For too long, individuals and small businesses shopping for insurance 
on their own have had very limited options. The plans that were 
available were often too expensive. Now, for the first time, insurance 
companies will have to compete against each other for business on a 
level playing field. That will mean lower premiums, better coverage, 
and more choices.
  Health reform has also reduced government costs by dramatically 
slowing the growth in spending. According to our nonpartisan 
scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, health reform slowed the 
growth in health spending by 4 percent. That will save taxpayer dollars 
and help get our deficit problem under control.
  We need to let the law keep working to save families and taxpayers 
more money. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that repealing the 
affordable care act--repealing it now--would increase the Federal 
deficit by nearly $143 billion over the next decade. Repeal would cost 
the Federal deficit $143 billion over the next decade according to the 
Congressional Budget Office, and it would increase the deficit by more 
than $1 trillion in the decade after that.
  Repealing health reform would also leave tens of millions of 
Americans without insurance. Studies have shown this would cost every 
American family an extra $1,000 a year. That is something we cannot 
afford. The affordable care act has already saved millions of Americans 
money and helped them get affordable health care, and millions more 
will gain access in the coming years. Healthy citizens are, indeed, the 
greatest asset our country has. We need to let health reform keep 
working for all Americans.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.

             OPPOSING THE REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE

                            of rhode island

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, February 10, 2011

  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, America is the strongest Nation in the 
world, we hold our freedoms sacred--and we have fought to protect these 
freedoms for centuries, and many have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Yet, 
there is a great and impending threat to that strength and freedom, a 
threat that imperils millions of Americans--the repeal of our Nation's 
Health Care Reform.
  As a new member of this Congress, protecting Health Care Reform is 
the first line in the sand. I was sent to Washington to fight for Rhode 
Islanders. As I have heard loudly over the past year, and witnessed 
first-hand as a Mayor for the last 8 years, families in my state have 
spent enough time awake at night worrying about where they'll find 
work, or the security of their current job. I will not support any 
action that places an additional burden on the people of Rhode Island. 
I will not have them lie awake at night, now having to once again worry 
that they will lose their health care when they need it most, or 
wondering how they'll pay for this month's prescriptions, or whether 
their child will be denied coverage because of a pre-existing 
condition.
  Just yesterday I had the privilege of hearing from a Rhode Islander, 
Alex Lataille, who spoke at the one and only hearings Congress had, to 
discuss the negative effects of repealing the new health care law.
  Alex graduated last May with two bachelor's degrees, and while 
looking for a job after graduation, he is able to afford health 
insurance because he can stay on his parents' policy. Repealing this 
law means Alex and millions of Americans will lose their coverage.
  Recently while having breakfast in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, I met a 
young woman named Beth. She said she was going to be a constituent of 
mine, and she had only one request. For years she had been, and 
remains, an insurance sales agent. But for as many years, she has been 
denied access to health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. 
Each and every day served as a painful reminder that while she was 
selling insurance to others, she was being denied the very same 
coverage. As someone well attuned to the health care industry and the 
Affordable Care Act itself, this young woman knew that health care 
reform meant hope, provided certainty, and would finally allow her to 
get the access to affordable health care she would need--relieving her 
of years of fear and anxiety. She asked for my commitment to defend 
health care reform.
  The Affordable Care Act establishes a Pre-Existing Condition 
Insurance Plan--one that would provide new coverage options for 
Americans like Beth until 2014, when, finally, all discrimination 
against Americans with pre-existing conditions will be prohibited. 
Recently I also had the opportunity to speak with Susan, a mother of 
five from Rhode Island. Susan and her husband Ed are both middle-income 
earners. Recently their two sons, age 22 and 23, graduated from 
college. Both sons found entry level work, but neither receives health 
insurance from their employers. Under the current law, both sons will 
be eligible for coverage under their mother's health insurance plan 
when it renews in eight months. Susan went on to tell me that it would 
cost her more than $600 per month to provide coverage to her sons 
through COBRA. She said that with three children still at home, and 
despite the fact her and her husband are employed, they cannot support 
the added expense beyond eight months.
  With repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the temporary gap that Susan 
and her family face would become a permanent gap. We are sending a 
deplorable message to Americans, and indeed the world, if we abandon 
hard working men and woman like Susan and Ed, and let their two sons--
both college graduates, both duly employed, go without health coverage 
until they find jobs that provide health insurance.
  I come to this Congress to help bring common sense solutions to 
complex problems. When I look at the impact of repealing the Affordable 
Care Act, I think about the struggles of Alex, Beth and Susan, Ed and 
their two sons. I think about the number of Rhode Islanders who will 
once again find themselves saddled with greater financial burdens. I 
think about the many men, women, and children of my state who will once 
again face uncertainty over something as fundamental as their own 
health and well-being. When I think about these consequences, it is 
common sense, and an understanding of the struggles faced by so many 
Rhode Islanders that compels me to object so strongly to this proposed 
repeal.
  I was sent here to find practical solutions to solve the problems 
facing Rhode Island families. Let's work to improve this law, not 
repeal it.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to take a moment to recognize 
our Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives who last week 
cast the 50th vote in their effort to dismantle the Affordable Care 
Act--their 50th. I know it is a tradition to give gold in celebration 
of a 50th milestone. I instead would like to gift my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle with a reality check.
  More specifically, today I would like to talk about a certain group 
of people who arguably stand to lose if their antics continue. So I 
have come to the floor this afternoon to set the record straight on the 
Affordable Care Act and how it is working for women in America. It is 
not much of a stretch for me to say the Affordable Care Act is probably 
one of the most significant pieces of legislation for women in my 
lifetime. Not because of the battles we fought to get it to the 
President's desk, not necessarily because of the size or scope of the 
law, but because of the tangible and positive impact it has had and 
will continue to have on the health and well being of women in America.
  Four years ago health insurance companies could deny women care due 
to so-called preexisting conditions such as pregnancy or being a victim 
of domestic violence. Four years ago women were permitted to be legally 
discriminated against when it came to insurance premiums and were often 
paying more for coverage than men. Four years ago women did not have 
access to the full range of recommended preventive care, such as 
mammograms and prenatal screenings and more. Four years ago the 
insurance companies had all the leverage. Four years ago too often 
women were the ones who were paying the price. That is why I am proud 
today to highlight just how far we have come for women in the past 4 
years.
  Since the Affordable Care Act became law, women have been treated 
fairly with increased access to affordable health insurance, benefits, 
and services. Deductibles and other expenses have been capped so a 
health care crisis does not cause a family to lose their home or their 
life savings.
  Women can use the health care marketplaces to pick quality plans that 
work for them and their families. If they change jobs or have to move, 
they are able to keep their coverage. Starting in 2012, we saw these 
benefits for women expand even further. Additional types of maternity 
are now covered. Women are now armed with proper tools and resources in 
order to take the right steps to have a healthy pregnancy.
  Women now have access to domestic partner violence screening and 
counseling, as well as screening for sexually transmitted infections. 
Now women finally have access to affordable birth control. As public 
servants here, it is our job to help our constituents access Federal 
benefits available to them, particularly when it comes to health care. 
Since 80 percent of women are not only making health care choices for 
themselves but also their families and loved ones, it is our 
responsibility to serve as a guide when it comes to understanding how 
to best access these benefits.
  It might mean putting them in touch with a navigator to ensure they 
are getting the most affordable health insurance available or making 
them aware of an enrollment event where they can get information on 
available coverage options. But our responsibilities do not end there. 
It is our job to have an open, honest discussion about what the 
Affordable Care Act means for our constituents and to talk about ways 
to responsibly improve it.
  Instead, as we saw in the House last week, others have spent the 
better part of the last 4 years trying to take away the critical 
benefits that I just talked about, trying to score cheap political 
points on an issue that can literally mean the difference between life 
and death. I can understand why some of our colleagues disagree with 
certain parts of this law or maybe how it was implemented, but what I 
cannot understand is why anyone elected to Congress would decide to 
simply ignore real life stories of their own constituents whose lives 
were changed the day this law took effect.
  It is people like Susan Wellman. She lives in Bellingham in my home 
State of Washington. She is self employed. She has had to pay for 
individual insurance. Every year she has watched her health care costs 
rise higher and higher. It got to the point where she was

[[Page S1503]]

paying $300 monthly premiums with an $8,000 deductible, all for a plan 
she described as ``paying for nothing.''
  So as soon as Susan could access health care through the Washington 
State health care exchange, she jumped at the chance. She spoke on the 
phone with a real live person. She was able to sign up for an 
affordable plan in a matter of minutes. Now Susan is on a plan that 
costs her $125 a month instead of $300. It is a plan that has a $2,000 
deductible that actually pays for things. Guess what. She can afford to 
go to the doctor, not just in the case of an emergency but for a 
physical or a mammogram that could save her life, not to mention 
thousands and thousands of dollars in health care costs.
  That kind of preventive care is good for women like Susan. It is good 
for her family, and it is good for this country because when more 
people have access to preventive care, it makes health care cheaper for 
every single one of us.
  It is also good for women like Carrie Little. She is a certified 
organic farmer who lives in Orting, WA. A few weeks ago she was working 
outside when one of the rams on her farm attacked her, leaving her with 
bruises and a broken leg. Fortunately, because of her new health plan, 
her visit to the emergency room was painless. Well, as painless as it 
could be with a broken leg. But her hospital bills, her cast, and her 
visits to the orthopedic physician were paid in full.

  Until last year, Carrie had been spending half of her income for a 
catastrophic-only health plan, forcing her to pay out of pocket for 
even the most basic of care. Carrie wrote an op-ed, and I want to quote 
from it. She said:

       What a welcome relief that my new health plan covers 
     preventive care, like mammograms, immunizations, and yearly 
     doctor visits. I can keep the primary care doctor I have been 
     seeing for years. And I no longer worry about family members 
     getting kicked around due to pre-existing conditions. Thank 
     goodness. In agriculture, profits and losses shift like the 
     weather, so for our community, it is crucial that health 
     premiums stay affordable.

  Or women like Ingrid Gordon. Ingrid is a small business owner from 
Seattle who immediately enrolled in coverage when it became available. 
After an hour on the Web site, she told us, with minimal technical 
difficulties, Ingrid was enrolled and received her insurance card in 
the mail a few days later. Since her coverage began on January 1, 
Ingrid had her first dental and physical exams in 14 years. She cured a 
skin disorder thanks to prescription medicine. She scheduled a 
colonoscopy now that she is 50, and finally had her bothersome knee x-
rayed.
  All of those exams, visits and prescriptions would have cost Ingrid 
thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket just 1 year 
ago. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Ingrid paid a grand total 
of zero dollars in copays.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women like Susan and Carrie and 
Ingrid are now fully in charge of their own health care, not their 
insurance company. That is why I feel so strongly that we cannot go 
back to the way things were. While we can never stop working to make 
improvements, of course, we owe it to the women of America to make 
progress and not allow the clock to be rolled back on their health care 
needs.
  As we all know, unfortunately, there are efforts underway all across 
the country, including here in our Nation's capital, to severely 
undermine a woman's access to some of the most critical and life-saving 
services that are provided by the Affordable Care Act. No provision of 
this law has faced quite as much scrutiny as the idea of providing 
affordable, quality reproductive health services to the women of 
America.
  We have seen attempt after attempt to eliminate access to abortion 
services and low-cost birth control all while restricting a woman's 
ability to make personal decisions about her own care. I guess we 
should not be surprised. The truth is that the tide of these 
politically driven, extreme efforts continues to rise.
  In 2013 our Nation saw yet another record-breaking year of State 
legislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women's access to 
reproductive services. In fact, in the past 3 years the United States 
has enacted more of these restrictions than in the previous 10 years 
combined. That means that now more than ever, it is our job to protect 
these kinds of decisions for women, to fight for women's health, and to 
ensure that women's health does not become a political football.
  For this reason I was very proud to lead members of my caucus in 
filing a brief with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case 
of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., where a secular corporation 
and its shareholders are trying to get in between a woman and her 
health.
  Just like the many attempts before this case, there are those out 
there who would like the American public to believe that this 
conversation is anything but an attack on women's health care. To them 
it is a debate about freedom, except of course freedom for a woman to 
access her own care. It is no different than when we are told that a 
tax on abortion rights is not an infringement on a woman's right to 
choose; they are about religion or State's rights; or when we are told 
that restricting emergency contraception is not about limiting a 
woman's ability to make her own family planning decisions; it is about 
protecting pharmacists; or just like last week, when an Alaskan State 
Senator said he did not think there was a compelling reason for the 
government ``to finance other people's recreation.'' That was in 
reference, of course, to contraception coverage in health care. In 
fact, after doing some research, this State Senator concluded that 
since birth control costs about ``four or five lattes'' the government 
should really have no reason to cover this cost to women.
  The truth is that this is about contraception. This is an attempt to 
limit a woman's ability to access her own health care. This is about 
women. Allowing a woman's boss to call the shots about her access to 
birth control should be inconceivable to all Americans in this day and 
age, and it would take us back to a place in history when women had no 
voice and no choice.
  In fact, contraception was included as a required preventive service 
in the Affordable Care Act on the recommendation of an independent, 
nonprofit institute of medicine and other medical experts because it is 
essential to the health of women and families.
  After many years of research, we know ensuring access to effective 
birth control has a direct impact on improving the lives of women and 
their families in America. We have been able to directly link it to 
declines in maternal and infant mortality, reduced risk of ovarian 
cancer, better overall health outcomes for women, and far fewer 
unintended pregnancies and abortions, which is a goal we all should 
share.
  But what is at stake in this case now before the Supreme Court is 
whether a CEO's personal beliefs can trump a woman's right to access 
free or low-cost contraception under the Affordable Care Act.
  Every American deserves to have access to high-quality health care 
coverage, regardless of where they work. Each of us should have the 
right to make our own medical and religious decisions without being 
dictated to or limited by our employers. Contraceptive coverage is 
supported by the vast majority of Americans who understand how 
important it is for women and their families.
  In weighing this case, my hope is that the Court realizes women 
working for private companies should be afforded the same access to 
medical care regardless of who signs their paychecks. We can't allow 
for-profit secular corporations or their shareholders to deny female 
employees access to comprehensive women's health care under the guise 
of religious exemption. It is as if we are saying: Because you are a 
CEO or a shareholder in a corporation, your rights are more important 
than your employees', who happen to be women. That is a slippery slope 
that could lead to employers cutting off coverage for childhood 
immunizations if they object to that idea or prenatal care for children 
born to unmarried parents if they think it is wrong, or blocking an 
employee's ability to access HIV treatment.
  I was proud to be joined in filing the brief by 18 other Senators who 
were here when Congress enacted the religious protections under the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 and who were also here when 
Congress made access to women's health care available under the 
Affordable Care Act of 2010. They are Senators who

[[Page S1504]]

know Congress did not intend for a corporation or, furthermore, its 
shareholders to restrict a woman's access to preventive health care.
  In the coming weeks, as the Supreme Court prepares to begin oral 
arguments in this case, these Senators and our colleagues who support 
these efforts will echo those sentiments, because we all know that 
improving access to birth control is good health policy and good 
economic policy. It means healthier women, healthier children, 
healthier families, and it will save monies for our businesses and 
consumers.
  I know many of our colleagues here believe that repealing the 
Affordable Care Act and access to reproductive health services is a 
political winner for them. But the truth is this law and these 
provisions are a winner for women, for men, for our children, and our 
health care system overall.
  I am very proud to stand with my colleagues who are committed to 
making sure the benefits of this law don't get taken away from the 
women of America, because politics and ideology should not matter when 
it comes to making sure women get the care they need at a cost they can 
afford.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.

             THE COMING EFFECTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Salmon). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the House leadership for allowing 
me to utilize this hour to talk about some of the coming effects of the 
Affordable Care Act.


                           The Boston Tragedy

  Mr. BURGESS. First, I do want to take a moment and join with so many 
of my colleagues who have just spoken on the floor in acknowledging the 
sacrifices that were made by first responders, people who ran toward 
the sound of the destruction this afternoon in Boston; and I certainly 
would recognize that even now, at this late hour, doctors and nurses 
are working in the emergency rooms in Boston to try to provide comfort 
to the afflicted and save life and limb for those who were damaged this 
afternoon, an act so astonishing in its cruelty, it is difficult to 
comprehend.
  Mr. Speaker, in 5\1/2\ short months from right now, October 1, 2013, 
the full effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are 
going to start to be felt around the country. It's important that we 
take a few moments this evening and think about the road ahead, think 
about the things that are supposed to come online on October 1, and 
think about the contingencies if those things are not able to be 
accomplished.
  It was just a few weeks ago in this town when speaking to the 
American

[[Page H2014]]

Health Insurance group, one of the information technologists from 
Health and Human Services talked about this informational hub that is 
supposed to be developed by the Department of Health and Human 
Services, this informational hub that will allow people to go online to 
sign up for their benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The comments 
of this individual were quite revealing. Speaking to an AHIP group 
earlier this year, he said:

       The time for debating about the size of the text on the 
     screen or the color or whether it's a world-class user 
     experience, that's what we used to talk about 2 years ago. 
     Now let's just make sure it's not a Third World experience.

  That's a pretty sobering admission from someone who is charged with 
providing the information hub, the information technology, the computer 
architecture that is supposed to be the underpinnings of the Affordable 
Care Act.
  Bear in mind, it was 3 years ago, March of 2010, that the Affordable 
Care Act was signed into law. So 3 years later, billions of dollars 
spent in the implementation phase, and they're not sure if they can get 
this computer system up and running by October 1, which, by law, is 
when it is supposed to kick in.

                              {time}  1930

  That is a pretty significant admission from the information architect 
at the Department of Health and Human Services.
  Now, when Barry Cohen, who is the head of the Center for Consumer 
Information and Insurance Oversight in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, was addressing the same group in response to a 
question, he was a little bit unclear as to whether or not they would 
be, in fact, ready on that October 1 deadline.
  He said:

       We'll have to wait. Then we'll be in a position to know 
     which contingency plans we actually have to implement.

  In other words, we can't plan for the contingency until we get there 
and see that a contingency plan is necessary. But, after all, what are 
contingency plans but those plans that are put in place because 
something unexpected may happen?
  Last week, on the other side of the Capitol, in the other body, the 
Senator from West Virginia said:

       ObamaCare is so complicated, and if it isn't done right the 
     first time, it will just simply get worse.

  That's a pretty startling pronouncement from someone who was, in 
fact, a pretty big cheerleader for the Affordable Care Act when it went 
through the Senate.
  He went on to say:

       I believe that the Affordable Care Act is probably the most 
     complex piece of legislation ever passed by the United States 
     Congress. Tax reform has obviously been huge, too, but up to 
     this point, this--the Affordable Care Act--is just beyond 
     comprehension.

  Now, what does the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services have to say about all of this? She maintains that the 
Affordable Care Act will lower the cost of premiums for everyone; but 
in fact, in the past couple of weeks, she has admitted:

       These folks will be moving into a really fully insured 
     product for the first time, and so there may be a higher cost 
     associated with getting into that market.

  Translation: you're going to be paying more.
  She goes on to say:

       Some men and some younger customers could see their rates 
     increase. Women and older customers could see their rates 
     drop.

  So, Mr. Speaker, I would submit that the coming rate shock is 
something for which people are actually unprepared. They have been told 
for 3 years that, after all, this is the Affordable Care Act, and it's 
going to make health care more affordable for all Americans; but the 
reality is somewhat different from the truth that is espoused by the 
Department of Health and Human Services.
  Let's think about some of these things for just a minute, because 
they are important. Remember when the Affordable Care Act was debated? 
Remember the President's discussing the Affordable Care Act? Everyone 
wanted to talk about patients with preexisting conditions: patients 
with preexisting conditions are frozen out of the system; patients with 
preexisting conditions can't get care. Well, they meant couldn't get 
insurance, because people can get care. Nevertheless, this was proposed 
as an enormous problem. The Affordable Care Act was going to fix it.
  How did the Affordable Care Act fix it?
  Next year, when the exchanges are up and running or when Medicaid is 
expanded, people, indeed, may be incorporated into that system. Until 
that day arrives, they were to be taken care of through what is known 
as the Preexisting Condition Insurance Program, or PCIP, which is the 
Federal preexisting risk pool that was set up for the first time under 
the Affordable Care Act. Five billion dollars was put forward to help 
people with preexisting conditions with their premiums. Now, there was 
a little bit of a barrier to entry. You had to be uninsured for 6 
months' time before you would be eligible for coverage under the 
preexisting condition program.
  I've got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I thought the Supreme Court was 
going to knock this thing out of the water. I thought there was no way 
in the world the highest court of the land could look at this thing and 
agree that it is constitutional under the Commerce Clause; that is, you 
can compel commerce in order to regulate it. I just knew that that day 
when the Supreme Court ruled that they would agree with me. In fact, 
they did; but then they went on to say that, in fact, since it's all a 
tax, Congress has the power to tax, and for that reason, it's not 
unconstitutional, and the law was allowed to stand.
  Leading up to that day that the Supreme Court made that 
pronouncement, I was so convinced that we as Members of Congress had an 
obligation to our constituents--to people who were, in fact, thinking 
that they were covered under the Affordable Care Act--to provide a 
contingency plan, particularly for those people who were covered under 
this new Federal preexisting condition insurance plan. Well, it turns 
out I wasn't right, and the law was constitutional.
  But what would have happened last June 30 if the Supreme Court had 
said that it was unconstitutional, and the whole thing was struck down? 
As a consequence, people who were in the preexisting condition program 
would have found themselves without insurance, and that would have been 
a pretty significant event to have occurred. I felt that we needed to 
have a contingency plan to cover those individuals.
  Now here we are some 6, 8 months later; and what happened in January 
of this year? The PCIP program ran out of money. It ran out of money at 
the end of January, and they said, We're not taking any more people 
into this program.
  We had a hearing a couple of weeks ago in the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce and heard from a patient who had thought she was in the queue, 
in that waiting period, to get into the Federal preexisting condition 
program except that they suspended enrollment at the end of January. 
You've got to believe that there were a lot of people who were in that 
6-month waiting period who were waiting for their time to come up so 
that they could, in fact, enroll in this preexisting condition program; 
but as of the end of January, they were shut out. So the committee 
wrote a letter to the President that said, We'd like to help you here. 
There are probably other moneys in the Affordable Care Act that can be 
moved around and can continue to cover these individuals until January 
1 of 2014 when the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion and all of the 
goodies prescribed in the Affordable Care Act can come on line.
  One of the things that we were told in leading up to the passage of 
the Affordable Care Act is that there were millions of people who fell 
into this preexisting condition trap. In fact, on the floor of the 
House, you heard people quote figures of 8 to 12 million people. The 
Speaker of the House at that time, Speaker Pelosi, said 125 million 
people had preexisting conditions. In fact, that was a little bit of a 
misnomer because, when you look at the people who are covered by 
insurance in this country, the vast majority is covered under what's 
called a ``large group plan,'' or what we know as ``employer-sponsored 
insurance.'' A preexisting condition exclusion can occur in that 
environment, but it's much, much rarer, and there are typically open 
enrollment periods in which a person can

[[Page H2015]]

get taken on to his employer's insurance. Now, for 65 percent of the 
population, that's not the issue. Certainly, for people in the small 
group market and in the individual market, in the small group market 
and in the individual market, there was a problem.

  On the numbers that people quoted prior to the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act--8 million, 10 million, 12 million people--how many 
people were in the Federal preexisting condition program at the end of 
June when I worried that the Supreme Court was going to strike the 
whole thing down?
  There were 65,000 people and certainly every one of those individuals 
with a compelling story--and not a small population but a manageable 
population. If we are just talking about trying to correct a problem 
for 65,000 people in a country of 310 million, I would submit that we 
can do that without destroying the existing program, the employer-
sponsored insurance, that people said they liked and wanted to keep.
  Remember, if you like what you have, you can keep it?
  Instead of taking care of a problem for a relatively finite but 
compelling population, the administration and, at the time, the 
congressional Democrats pushed through a bill of ``we just want to 
control everything about your health care.'' They got their wish, but 
now we had probably 100,000 people in January who were in the Federal 
preexisting condition program, and now no new people can sign up for it 
because it is going to run out of money.
  Mr. Speaker, I would submit that there is other money available in 
things like, we call them, ``slush funds'' that were built into the 
Affordable Care Act; things like the Medicare Modernization Act; things 
like the fund that is to allow for other activities in the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services. So, by just shifting some money around, 
these people who have preexisting conditions, in fact, could be taken 
care of, and we have the ability to do that. Really, it would be a 
relatively easy lift at this point, and perhaps next week we'll see 
legislation on the floor.
  Can you imagine if this had been a Republican President who had taken 
people off the Federal preexisting condition program? You would have 
heard about it from every newspaper in the country, and every 
television outlet in the country would have talked about it. How much 
did you hear? Well, you're probably hearing about it tonight for the 
first time. You'll hear about it a little bit more next week. People 
don't want to talk about the failures embedded in the Affordable Care 
Act, but it is important that we do so.

                              {time}  1940

  Now, when this bill was passed into law, March of 2010, the then-
Speaker of the House, Speaker Pelosi, claimed that the Affordable Care 
Act would create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately. Well, 
that hasn't turned out to be exactly true, either.
  The Federal Reserve reported that employers are citing the 
uncertainty embedded in the Affordable Care Act as reasons for layoffs 
in companies and the reluctance to hire new employees.
  The application that was proposed by the Department of Health and 
Human Services for people to fill out to get coverage in the exchanges 
next year actually asks an applicant if their job is no longer offering 
health coverage in the next year. Clearly embedded in the Affordable 
Care Act was a risk to job creation in this country, and we're now 
seeing that actually come into being.
  The law does not treat everyone the same. It creates essentially a 
new underclass. It promises universal coverage, but it leaves some 
workers' families without coverage. Now, one of the most significant 
embedded problems in the Affordable Care Act is if an individual is 
working and their employer is providing them employer-sponsored 
insurance, that employer is required to do that; or if that employee 
looks for coverage in the exchange, that employer may be fined. But if 
the employer provides that employer-sponsored insurance, great. But he 
doesn't have to apply it, he doesn't have to provide that insurance to 
their family. This is a significant problem because that family, which 
right now may be covered, next year may not.
  But here's the other part of that. That family would not be eligible 
for a subsidy in the insurance exchange because the employer is 
providing the benefit to the employee, but there was nothing in the law 
that said they had to continue family coverage. So who is going to be 
affected, primarily women and children. A headline in the Fort Worth 
Star Telegram a few weeks ago, and the Fort Worth Star Telegram is 
generally supportive of the administration and generally supportive of 
the Affordable Care Act, but under their headline was, ``500,000 
Children to Lose Health Benefits Under the Affordable Care Act.''
  This was actually not through something that was revealed in the 
Department of Health and Human Services, but rather a rule that was 
proposed by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue 
Service. It turns out that children who lose insurance because the 
primary employee will be covered but the family will not, those 
children who lose insurance will not be fined by the IRS for not 
complying with the insurance mandate; but that is scant consolation for 
the fact that now they have no insurance and they have no reasonable 
way of achieving that because, after all, the cost for insurance is 
going to significantly increase under the Affordable Care Act.
  There is a 21-page application for Americans who feel that they 
should be covered under the Medicaid expansion. A 21-page application 
is pretty significant. It does ask some questions that you have to ask 
yourself, are they germane to someone who is applying for health 
insurance. But nevertheless, the application is out there. It's in the 
public domain, albeit it's a draft at this point. My hope is that the 
Department of Health and Human Services will refine that, but most of 
the 27- to 35-year-olds that I know are not going to spend a lot of 
time filling out a 21-page application.
  We were told in the run-up to the passage of this law that it would, 
in fact, pay down the deficit. It was $142 billion over 10 years, but 
it was supposed to reduce the deficit. Does anybody really believe that 
anymore? Of course not. And now the further evaluation of the costs and 
the expansive costs that are going to occur under the Affordable Care 
Act, probably an additional $1.5 trillion, at a conservative estimate, 
as to what this will add to the deficit over the next 10 years, and 
this is just for the subsidies and the exchanges and for the Medicaid 
expansion alone.
  Now, why does that matter? Mr. Speaker, it matters because in just a 
few short weeks, the statutory borrowing authority of the United States 
will be met or exceeded. And this Congress, this House, will once again 
be involved in another discussion about raising the debt limit. In July 
of 2011, we had this discussion. It was pretty acrimonious and 
attracted a lot of attention and a lot of publicity, none of it good. 
We're going to have that same fight occur again.
  A lot of people are concerned about the sequester. They say, we wish 
the sequester had never happened. But remember, the sequester was what 
the President proposed in order to get the expansion of the debt limit 
to a point where he would not have to deal with it again until after 
election day 2012. So the President got his wish. He said the sequester 
was good; it will allow us to get past this point and to move on. But 
now people are dealing with the aftermath.
  I would just ask you, what is the sequester going to look like in the 
summer of 2013, because the debt limit will not be just expanded to 
cover the obligations. There is going to have to be some spending 
discipline that goes along with that. I don't know what that will be. 
I'm not privy to those discussions, but will all the money that is 
promised to be there for the Medicaid expansion, for the subsidies in 
the exchange, will it in fact be there, or will that be exposed to some 
type of sequester-type device? I don't know the answer to that 
question, but those are questions in which this House will have to deal 
in literally a few short weeks' time.

  There has been significant tax policy that has gone into effect since 
the Affordable Care Act was passed. Just this year, five new taxes--
significant taxes--have occurred, as a result of the Affordable Care 
Act. There's a payroll tax that has increased almost 1 percent, 0.9 
percent.

[[Page H2016]]

  A payroll tax for people who earn over $200,000 a year, joint filers 
of $250,000 a year, some people look at that and say we knew that 
Medicare was getting into trouble. Maybe that is a good thing that that 
payroll tax for Medicare has gone up. Well, it might be except the 
money doesn't stay in the Medicare trust fund. It's collected, and then 
it immediately goes into the general revenue in order to pay for or 
offset the cost of the subsidies that are going to exist in the 
insurance exchange.
  One of the more onerous taxes that was begun on January 1 was a 2.4 
percent gross receipts tax on medical devices. Class II and class III 
medical devices as defined by the Food and Drug Administration are now 
subject to a 2.4 percent gross receipts tax. That's not a tax on 
profits; that's a tax on gross sales. It is significant. Sure, there 
are some big companies that will make due; but really it's the small 
entrepreneur who is developing medical devices, and this is happening 
all the time. Those individuals are the ones who are going to be 
particularly hard hit. And, as you can imagine, it may reduce some of 
that entrepreneurial activity or send it overseas.
  We already have a Food and Drug Administration that's sometimes 
difficult to deal with as far as getting things approved. Europe and 
Central Asia are not so difficult to deal with. And, hey, by the way, 
there's not that gross receipts tax. Perhaps we ought to move our 
manufacturing somewhere else. And, of course, the jobs go with the 
manufacturing.
  There's been a change in what are called flexible spending accounts. 
Flexible spending accounts are that money which you are able to 
designate at the beginning of every calendar year, and you can have 
pretax dollars that can be spent for recurrent medical expenses.
  This now has been capped at $2,500 a year. The amount was much higher 
previously; but under the Affordable Care Act, in order to offset some 
of the additional costs of the Affordable Care Act, they said we're 
going to cap those flexible spending account contributions to $2,500. 
That started this year.
  So if you've got a recurring medical expense that occurs every year, 
and think about someone with a family member who has a chronic medical 
condition or a family with a special needs child where they wanted to 
be able to set some dollars aside at the beginning of the year, not 
have them taxed so that they could pay for whatever it was that was 
going to be required, they are now capped at $2,500. People are going 
to very quickly find that amount is exceeded, and that they have been 
caught in this so-called FSA trap, or flexible spending account trap.
  For people who deduct medical expenses from their income tax, and as 
you know, currently for the last tax year for which we all just 
prepared our taxes and filed them this evening, there was a 7.5 percent 
exclusion from your adjusted gross income, that is, until your medical 
expenses equaled 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, you didn't 
get to deduct medical expenses from your tax. That amount has actually 
increased to 10 percent for next year. So people who were accustomed, 
people with a lot of medical expenses who were accustomed to keeping up 
with those receipts and then being able to deduct those medical 
expenses as they exceeded 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income, 
they're now not going to be able to deduct those expenses until after 
10 percent of their adjusted gross income.

                              {time}  1950

  So who have we punished here?
  We have punished the families with special needs children. We have 
punished people with chronic medical conditions. We've basically gone 
after the sickest Americans to say you're going to pay a little bit 
more for what everyone else is going to receive in the Affordable Care 
Act.
  There is going to be a tax on insurance companies--I'm sorry--a tax 
on insurance policies that people will have to pay. This will go into a 
couple of different accounts, a couple of different funds, but the 
bottom line is it costs more every year to buy your insurance.
  And then, beginning in 2018, the so-called tax on Cadillac insurance 
plans kicks in. And who's this going to affect?
  Well, yes, it will affect higher-income earners who get a generous 
insurance policy. But it also affects union members whose insurance 
policies were part of their collective bargaining agreements over time, 
and those policies which now are going to be judged to be Cadillac 
plans will actually be taxed at a much higher rate starting in 2018.
  There was supposed to be an exchange set up for small business. It 
was called the SHOP Exchange, small business health policies. Twenty-
nine times there were deadlines that were missed in setting up the SHOP 
exchanges. And now, just in the past couple of weeks, the Department of 
Health and Human Services said, it's pretty tough, pretty complicated. 
We don't know if we can do it or not, but we're giving ourselves 
another year. This won't happen until 2015.
  I think this is one of the things that really caused some of the 
consternation over in the Senate because in the other body this was one 
of the deals that they made in order to get the Affordable Care Act 
passed, in order to get it to the floor of the Senate in the fall of 
2009.
  It is instructive for people to remember how this thing came to be in 
the first place. Now, in the summer of 2009, the committees of 
jurisdiction here in the House--Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, 
Education and Labor--all debated a version of the House health care 
reform bill.
  Now, make no mistake about it. I think it was a crummy bill. H.R. 
3200 was the number. It did go through the committee process. It was 
amended several times in the various House committees. From there it 
went to the Speaker's desk, where it was all kind of consolidated; all 
three committee products were kind of melded into one, and then it came 
to the floor of the House, doubled in size, during that 2- or 3-month 
hiatus, and was passed by the House of Representatives in the fall, in 
November of 2009.
  Not a single--well, one Republican vote, and the rest carried by 
Democrats. Thirty-five Democrats voted against it because of some of 
the problems contained within that legislation.
  But the important thing is, as bad as I think it is, it did go 
through the regular House process. We may have been curtailed in the 
number of amendments we could offer in committee. Our time for debate 
in committee may have been limited but, nevertheless, it did come 
through the committee process.
  Not so in the Senate. H.R. 3200 has never been seen or heard from 
again. It passed the House, went over to the Senate to await activity, 
and there it went, up into the ether somewhere. No one really knows 
what happened to it.
  But, wait a minute. There's a health care law that was signed by the 
President in March of 2010. How did the health care law come into 
being?
  Well, the House had passed another bill in July of 2009. It was H.R. 
3590, dealt with housing. I think it passed the House with very few 
negative votes. But it was a housing bill.

  It went over to the Senate to await further activity, and that's the 
bill that was picked up by Senate leadership that was brought to the 
floor of the Senate and amended. The amendment read ``strike all after 
the enacting clause and insert,'' striking, of course, the language for 
the housing bill, which was the base bill, and inserting health care 
language, and that was the bill that the Senate passed late on 
Christmas Eve in 2009, right ahead of a big snowstorm that was coming 
to town.
  All the Senators wanted to get out so they passed this bill. Sixty 
votes. Not a single Republican vote. Passed with entirely Democratic 
votes.
  Now, under normal circumstances, H.R. 3590, which was now the Senate 
health care bill, and H.R. 3200, which was the House bill, would have 
gone to a conference committee. They would have worked rough edges out. 
They would have worked the differences out between the two bills, and a 
conference report would have come back to both Houses of Congress, the 
House and the Senate, and that would have been voted on, up or down.
  The problem was that, remember, it took 60 votes to pass it on the 
Senate side. Shortly after H.R. 3590 passed on the Senate side, a 
Democratic seat was lost. Scott Brown was elected from Massachusetts 
and, as a consequence, that 60th vote was no longer available to the 
Democratic leadership in the Senate.

[[Page H2017]]

  So what are they going to do?
  Well, they said that the House will just simply have to pass H.R. 
3590. After all, it was a House bill that was passed already by the 
House in July of 2009, amended by the Senate, to become a health care 
bill. All that is required for it to become law is for the House to 
take a vote; will the House now concur with the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 3590. So many as in favor, say aye.
  If that is a simple majority, 218 votes here in the House of 
Representatives, if that is a simple majority, then that's the end of 
the discussion. The bill goes down the street to the White House for a 
signing ceremony, and that's exactly what happened.
  Now, it took 3 months to accomplish that, because no one here in the 
House thought H.R. 3590 was a very good legislative product.
  In fact, let's be honest, Mr. Speaker. It was a rough draft that had 
been produced by the Senate Finance Committee, the staff of the Senate 
Finance Committee, as a vehicle to get the Senate to conference with 
the House. They never expected for this thing to be signed into law. It 
was a vehicle to get to a conference to then sit down with the House, 
and let's work out these differences between the two of us, and then 
we'll get a conference committee product to come to the floor. But it 
didn't work out.
  As a consequence, the bill that was signed into law was one that was 
never intended to become law. It was a product produced by the staff of 
the Senate Finance Committee as a vehicle to get them out of town 
before Christmas Eve so that they could then get to the conference 
committee where the real work, the real work of writing this health 
care law would occur.
  The American people were cheated by this process, Mr. Speaker. And 
now, we're left to deal with the consequences.
  And what are the consequences?
  500,000 children, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, being 
taken off their parents' employer-sponsored insurance. People in the 
preexisting program who had been waiting patiently for their turn are 
now told, we're sorry, it's full up. No more space. You can't come in.
  It didn't have to be this way. There were good ideas on both sides 
that could have been taken into account.
  One of the fundamental questions I think we have to ask ourselves 
over and over again is where were the country's Governors when this 
bill was actually written. Well, of course it was written by the Senate 
Finance Committee staff, so the Governors were nowhere in the room. A 
lot of deals that were struck between some of the special interest 
groups and the White House were all done down at the White House in 
July of 2009. The Nation's governors weren't involved in that.
  Why were the Nation's governors so reluctant to accept the exchanges, 
the Medicaid expansion?
  Well, the answer, Mr. Speaker, is because they were dealt out of the 
process. And then, the rulemaking that started happening after the law 
was signed began to scare them, but a lot of the rules were held until 
after Election Day.
  The rule governing essential health benefits--what Governor in their 
right mind is going to sign on to an exchange program where they don't 
even know what they're going to be required to cover? They don't know 
how much money it is going to cost them?
  Well, it's no surprise that 26 States said no dice to the exchange. 
An additional six States said maybe we'll do a partnership, but you go 
ahead and set the program up through the Federal level first.
  And as consequence, the Office of Personnel Management is now 
required to set up exchanges for 26 States, plus six that might want 
partnership, and that's a tall order, which is why Gary Cohen said, I'm 
not sure we're going to need a contingency plan, but we can't know what 
contingency we have until we actually get there.
  I will submit there is going to be a need for a contingency plan. The 
sooner that the agencies admit that to the appropriate committees in 
the House and Senate, the sooner they can begin to work on a solution 
for a problem.
  Because, Mr. Speaker, let's face it. January 1 of 2014, there's going 
to be an emergency room, there's going to be an operating room, there's 
going to be a delivery room where a patient and doctor are going to 
come in contact with each other, and they don't need the uncertainty of 
what this legislation has dealt them.
  I thank the Speaker for the time this evening, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to spend a few minutes talking 
about the Affordable Care Act. I wonder how many people on the 
Republican side today are going to talk about ObamaCare. If they do, 
they should be in a very positive state. We know that as a result of 
this bill, the Affordable Care Act, people are getting or soon will get 
a rebate. One of the things we did--led by Senator Franken and others--
was make sure that 80 percent of the money paid for premiums goes to 
patient care and any amount that doesn't has to be refunded to the 
patients. That is in the process now. In the month of August, all those 
moneys will come back in a significant amount to Americans who, in 
effect, are part of programs that spend too much on salaries for 
bosses.
  Also, we are going to talk a little bit today about what this 
Affordable Care Act does for women in America. As I said, I am going to 
speak very briefly, but we are going to have people come--as soon as I 
and the Republican leader finish--to talk about good things in this 
bill for women. I will touch on them very briefly.
  There is no question this bill that was signed by President Obama is 
a landmark piece of legislation. It signaled an end to insurance 
company discrimination among many but especially against those who are 
ill, those with a preexisting condition, and especially against women.
  As a result of this bill we passed, being a woman is no longer a 
preexisting disability in America. For many years, insurance companies 
charged American women higher premiums. Why? Because they are women. 
For years, American women have unfairly borne the burden of the high 
cost of contraception as well. Even women with private insurance often 
wind up spending hundreds of dollars more each year for birth control. 
Today, women of reproductive age spend two-thirds more out of their own 
pockets for health care costs than men, largely due to the high cost of 
birth control. But starting tomorrow--Wednesday of this week--new 
insurance plans must cover contraception and many other preventive 
health services for women. How much? No additional pay at all. Under 
health care reform, about 47 million women, including almost 400,000 
women in Nevada, will have guaranteed access to those additional 
preventive services without cost sharing.
  Many on the other side downplayed the importance of these benefits or 
fought to repeal them altogether. It is hard to comprehend but true. 
Forcing American women to continue struggling with the high price of 
contraception has very real consequences. Every year millions of women 
in the United States put off doctors' visits because they can't afford 
the copay and millions more skip pills or shots to save money.
  It is no mystery why the United States has one of the highest rates 
of unintended pregnancies of all industrialized nations. Half of all 
pregnancies in America are unplanned. Of those unintended pregnancies, 
about half wind up in abortion. Increasing access to contraception is 
the most effective way to reduce unintended pregnancies and reduce the 
number of abortions, but the high cost is often a barrier.
  That is why, in 1997, Olympia Snowe and I began a bipartisan effort 
to prevent unintended pregnancies by expanding access to contraception. 
It has not been an easy path, but we did make a start. As part of this 
effort, we helped pass a law ensuring Federal employees access to 
contraception. It was a big issue. That was 15 years ago or more. It is 
an issue that is still important, but we started it, and I am very 
happy about that. Olympia Snowe was terrific to work with.
  When this benefit took place in 1999, premiums did not go up one 
single dime because neither did health care costs--not one penny. It 
was rewarding to note that a pro-life Democrat and pro-choice 
Republican were able to confront the issue with a practical eye rather 
than a political eye. It is unfortunate that over the last 15 years an 
idea that started as a common-ground proposal has become so polarizing 
in Congress. The controversy is quite strange when we consider that 
almost 99 percent of women have relied on contraception at some point 
in their lives, and many have struggled to afford it. The Affordable 
Care Act will ensure that insurance companies treat women fairly and 
treat birth control as any other preventive service.
  Prior to Senator Snowe and me doing this, anything a man wanted they 
got. Viagra, fine; we will take care of that. Anything a man wanted 
they got--but not a woman. The law doesn't just guarantee women's 
access to contraception, it assures their access to many other 
lifesaving procedures as well.
  Thanks to the health care bill--the Affordable Care Act--insurance 
companies are already required to cover preventive care such as 
mammograms. For a person who is able to have a mammogram, it is 
lifesaving. Most people in the Senate know my wife is battling breast 
cancer. She had a mammogram in December and in August discovered a lump 
in her breast. Think of what would have happened if she had waited 1 
year because she couldn't afford that mammogram. Frankly, the thought 
of it is very hard for me to comprehend because even though she had 
that mammogram in December, she had found it and was in stage 3 of 
breast cancer. It has been very difficult. What if she waited an extra 
year? Many people wait a lot longer than an extra year.
  Colonoscopies save lives. I was talking to one of my friends in the 
Senate who is going to have his done. They do it every 5 years. It 
takes at least 10 years for polyps to develop into cancer, and some 
polyps develop into cancer if they are not taken out. People need to 
have this done.
  Blood pressure checks, childhood immunizations without cost sharing 
is part of what is in this bill. It used to be a bill; now it is the 
law.
  Starting tomorrow--again, Wednesday of this week--women will no 
longer have to reach in their pockets to pay for wellness checkups. 
They can do screening for diabetes, HPV testing, sexually transmitted 
infection counseling, HIV screening and counseling, breastfeeding 
support, domestic violence screening and counseling. That is all in the 
law starting tomorrow. All women in new insurance plans will have 
access to all forms of FDA-approved contraception without having to 
shell out more money on top of their premiums. Ending insurance company 
discrimination will help millions more women afford the care they need 
when they need it. It will restore basic fairness to the health care 
system. Sometimes the practical thing to do is also the right thing to 
do, and that is what the legislation we worked so hard to pass is all 
about. It is about doing the right thing for everyone. Today we are 
going to focus on women.

              DEFICIT SPENDING AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being recognized for the 
time, and I appreciate the recognition that this Chamber and my 
colleagues are putting on the issues before us.
  As we look at Federal spending, what we have to do is say: What is 
causing us to be in a position where we are borrowing $2 billion a day? 
And if we are borrowing $2 billion a day, we have to ask: Is that a 
sustainable practice and something that we as a Nation can continue? Of 
course the answer to that is, no, it is not sustainable. Therefore, we 
have to look at what is causing us to spend more money than we are 
taking in, and one of the things that is at the top of that list that 
is too expensive to afford is the ObamaCare program, the Affordable 
Care Act.
  What I would like to do today is focus my comments on what we are 
seeing from the Affordable Care Act and what has happened with the cost 
of this program and why it has become too expensive to afford and why 
we have to talk about it and focus on it and put it on the table as we 
talk about what our Nation spends.
  Now, we all remember supposedly ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, 
was going to be a $900 billion program, roughly, that was to give 
access to affordable health insurance for those who didn't have access 
to health insurance, but let's look at what has happened.
  This was the estimate: under a trillion dollars, $900 billion, when 
the program was passed. But, oh, remember, we had to pass it in order 
to read it to find out what was in it. After we read it the first time, 
$1.4 trillion. My source on this is the Congressional Budget Office, 
the CBO. Every time it has been reviewed, with some of the nearly 
13,000 pages of rules and regulations, guess what has happened? The 
cost estimate has gone up. Now ObamaCare is a $2.6 trillion program. So 
what we are looking at is a near tripling in cost before the program 
goes into effect. This is why we continue to say, as we look at fiscal 
health, fiscal restraint, you have to look at what is happening with 
the cost projections on ObamaCare.
  Now, for those of us from my State of Tennessee, this is something 
that is not new to us. We had the test case for HillaryCare in our 
State. It is called TennCare. What happened with the TennCare program 
was it ended up quadrupling in cost in a period of 5 years.
  Now, this causes us a little bit of concern because we look at what 
has happened with the cost of government-managed and -delivered health 
care services. Well, let's take a look at Medicare and where it was 
supposed to be in 1968 and then what has happened with its costs. You 
can look at these lines, the red line.
  These are on my Web site for our colleagues that would like to go and 
look at the Web site.
  You can see what happened in 1968, and the red line shows where it 
has grown to today. For something that was to end up being about $12 
billion a year, we are now spending over $400 billion a year on. You 
can see what were to be the projections here on this bottom line, and 
you see how far it has exceeded its projections. So because of this, we 
are quite concerned with the growth and the projections of growth for 
ObamaCare.
  Look at the track record of government spending. Do programs 
generally come in below their estimates? No. They generally exceed 
those estimates. So we continue to be very concerned about what will 
happen with the cost of ObamaCare and the impact this is going to have 
on our $3.5-trillion-a-year budget, and we continue to say: We have to 
review this; it is too expensive to afford; and does it fit into what 
the American taxpayer is willing to pay for?
  Because every penny we spend here in Washington, D.C., comes out of 
the taxpayers' pockets from money that they have earned and then have 
paid in taxes, sent to Washington, they expect us to be very careful 
stewards of those dollars.
  Before my time expires, Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out one 
other concern that we have with the exchanges and the way they are 
going to handle information. Six hundred million dollars to build a 
computer system that doesn't work and doesn't protect the

[[Page H6597]]

identity and the information of enrollees in the health care exchange 
is another of the problems there that is worthy of discussion of this 
program.

                           TEXT OF AMENDMENTS

  SA 3298. Mr. REID proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 3590, 
entitled The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as follows:

                 AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Tipton) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, let's begin with where we can all agree as 
Americans: at the very beginning of the debate when it came to health 
care in 2008, it was about affordability and accessibility when it 
comes to health care. We can't disagree about that. As Americans and 
small businessmen, we felt the pain of seeing ever-increasing premiums, 
but we also wanted to make sure that we had access to real doctors.
  What are the results that are now coming out of the Affordable Care 
Act? Let me give you an example that was just emailed to me last night 
out of a small community church in my district in Durango, Colorado. 
They were just able to extend their plan before the Affordable Care Act 
takes effect. For six employees working at the church, their premiums 
are now going to be $50,665 for the collective group this year. When 
the Affordable Care Act impacts them in the next cycle, those rates 
will rise for those same six employees to $72,069, a 48.7 percent 
increase.
  So the question we have to ask is: Has the Affordable Care Act 
achieved the goal that, as Americans, we can all agree that we desire 
to be able to have--affordability?
  Let's talk to those six people working in that small church in 
Durango, Colorado, who are relying on charitable contributions to be 
able to have their jobs, to have affordable health care. The answer is 
no.
  Let's talk to senior citizens that I visited with throughout the 
Third Congressional District of Colorado, many of whom just became 
senior citizens and are now required to sign up for Medicare under the 
law. Just because of a birthday over the last year or two, they are now 
finding that they cannot even find a doctor who will accept Medicare.
  I just held a meeting with better than 20 physicians in Grand 
Junction, Colorado, several of whom expressed that by the year 2014 
they're closing their practices. So have we addressed accessibility in 
America? We have not.
  What the administration fails to understand is there's a quantitative 
difference between affordability and accessibility and just having an 
insurance card. We can insure every American, but does that mean you 
have access to quality health care at an affordable price?
  The Republican Party is putting forward real solutions to be able to 
address this challenge. Let's let the free markets actually work. Let's 
have real competition. Let's allow businesses to be able to come 
together to be able to form real groups and to be able to negotiate 
lower rates. Let's incentivize rather than disincentivize, as the 
President's law does, those private medical health care savings 
accounts if we really care about health care. Let's, indeed, make sure 
that people with preexisting conditions have access and affordable 
health care as well.
  These are the plans that we are putting forward; but it's going to 
require that we work together. What is not helpful is when we hear an 
administration say it is nonnegotiable while at the same time saying we 
have to work together. We can't work together if we cannot have a 
dialogue. That is what this House of Representatives is putting 
forward--real solutions to be able to address the real problems to help 
real Americans that are struggling right now.
  And the bottom line is, if we want health care, we also need jobs. If 
you talk to the people in my district, small businesses, they aren't 
able to hire right now simply because of the cost of the Affordable 
Care Act and the impacts that they're feeling. These are affecting real 
Americans, real people, and real lives. The solution cannot and should 
not be just bigger government, just a legacy piece of legislation.
  I believe that the American people deserve a policy that will 
actually work for them. That can only be achieved if we work together. 
We are putting those ideas forward today. We are not about shutting 
down this government. We want to keep it open. That's the policy of our 
conference. But we also need to have a policy that's making sure that 
government laws are not hurting the American people. The Affordable 
Care Act is hurting the American people, will hurt the economy, will 
hurt jobs.

[[Page H5934]]

  This is something that we can achieve a positive solution on if the 
administration will open that door to dialogue rather than distrust. 
Let's work for the American people rather than for bigger government.

                    AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ANNIVERSARY

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this Saturday marks the third 
anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. At age 3, the 
law is protecting consumers against abusive insurance practices, 
helping seniors by lowering prescription drug costs, and building the 
infrastructure to expand health insurance coverage to millions of 
Americans. For the first time, patients' interests and needs are being 
put ahead of those of the insurance and drug companies.
  The Obama administration has worked tirelessly to implement the law, 
in the face of constant opposition. My Republican colleagues in 
Congress have voted to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act well 
over 30 times. It is a chilling, if useless, political refrain from the 
tea party.
  On this third anniversary, it is important not only to reflect on how 
far we have come but to continue pressing forward on the Affordable 
Care Act's many improvements to our health care system, particularly 
the delivery system reforms.
  The Council of Economic Advisers' 2013 ``Economic Report of the 
President'' identified a number of sources of waste in our health care 
system, including the fragmentation of the delivery system; duplicate 
care and overtreatment; the failure of providers to adopt best 
practices; and payment fraud. The council notes:

       Taken together, [these factors] have been estimated to 
     account for between 13 and 26 percent of national health 
     expenditures in 2011. The magnitude of this waste offers an 
     equally large opportunity for spending reductions and 
     improvement in quality of care an opportunity that underpins 
     many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

  Thankfully, we have the tools necessary to seize the opportunity 
described by the Council of Economic Advisers to drive down costs and 
improve the quality of patient care. The Affordable Care Act included 
45 provisions dedicated to improving the way we deliver health care in 
5 priority areas: payment reform, primary and preventive care, 
measuring and reporting quality, administrative simplification, and 
health information technology.
  The effort to extract from the wasteful swamp of our health care 
bureaucracy a lean, humane, patient-centered system is vital. National 
health spending hit $2.7 trillion in 2011 or about 18 percent of GDP. 
The next least efficient developed country--the Netherlands--spent 12 
percent of its GDP on health care in 2010. Germany and France spent 
11.6 percent of their GDP on health care. If we were as efficient as 
the Netherlands, if we merely moved from last place to second-to-last 
place in health care efficiency, we would save over $800 billion per 
year.
  For all of our excess spending, one might expect that Americans live 
longer, healthier lives. But that is not the case. The Institute of 
Medicine recently compared the United States to 17 peer countries. We 
were worst for prevalence of diabetes among adults, worst for obesity 
across all age groups, and worst in infant mortality. We suffer higher 
death rates and worse outcomes for conditions such as heart disease and 
chronic lung disease.
  According to the Week, avoidable infections passed on due to poor 
hospital hygiene kill as many people in the United States--about 
103,000 a year--as AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents combined. 
These deaths are tragic because they are largely preventable. As we 
have shown in Rhode Island, when hospital staff follow a checklist of 
basic instructions washing their hands with soap, cleaning a patient's 
skin with antiseptic, placing sterile drapes over the patient, etc.--
rates of infection plummet, and the costs of treating those infections 
disappear. The costs of treating the 100,000 who die, as well as the 
hundreds of thousands who suffer nonlethal infections, disappear.
  Delivery system reform has real promise in improving the management 
and prevention of chronic disease. These diseases accounted for 7 out 
of 10 deaths in the United States in 2011 and at least 75 percent of 
our health care spending.
  I am not alone in saying that a correct diagnosis of the problem will 
lead us to delivery system reform. Gail Wilensky, the former 
Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services under 
President George H.W. Bush, said in 2011, ``If we don't redesign what 
we are doing, we can't just cut unit reimbursement and think we are 
somehow getting a better system.''
  In the private sector, George Halvorson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser 
Permanente said, ``There are people right now who want to cut benefits 
and ration care and have that be the avenue to cost reduction in this 
country and that's wrong. It's so wrong, it's almost criminal. It's an 
inept way of thinking about health care.''
  Saving money by reforming how we deliver health care isn't just 
possible, it is happening. At a 2011 hearing I chaired of the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Greg Poulsen of 
Intermountain Healthcare said:

       Intermountain and other organizations have shown that 
     improving quality is compatible with lowering costs and, 
     indeed, high-quality care is generally less expensive than 
     substandard care.

  So when Republicans say we must cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits to 
fix our deficit, that assertion is flat-out wrong.
  Attacking Medicare and Medicaid is consistent with a particular 
political ideology, but it is not consistent with the facts. It ignores 
the fact that we operate a wildly inefficient health care system and 
that our health care spending problem is systemwide, not unique to 
Federal health programs. It is not just Medicare and Medicaid; former 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said of the Defense budget, ``We're 
being eaten alive by health care.''
  The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that we could 
save approximately $700 billion every year in our health care system 
without compromising health outcomes. The Institute of Medicine 
recently put this number at $750 billion. Other groups are even more 
optimistic: The New England Healthcare Institute has reported that $850 
billion could be saved annually. The Lewin Group and former Bush 
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have estimated annual savings of a 
staggering $1 trillion. Most recently, the Commonwealth Fund laid out a 
set of policies that would accelerate health care delivery system 
reform and slow health spending by $2 trillion over the next 10 years.
  These savings will have a dramatic impact on the Federal budget. The 
Federal Government spends 40 percent of

[[Page S2024]]

America's health care expenditures. If the estimate by the Council of 
Economic Advisers is correct, we could reduce the Federal deficit by up 
to $280 billion per year. If we achieve only one-quarter of the Council 
of Economic Advisers' estimate, the Federal savings would be $70 
billion annually. Over a 10-year budget period, that amounts to $700 
billion in Federal health care savings all without taking away any 
benefits, all while likely improving quality of care.
  In a report I issued last year for the Senate Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, I found that the administration has made 
considerable progress on implementing the 45 delivery system reform 
provisions in the law. But more can and must be done. Specifically, I 
again urge the administration to set a cost-savings target for health 
care delivery system reform. A cost-savings target will focus, guide, 
and spur the administration's efforts in a manner that vague intentions 
to ``bend the health care cost curve'' will not. As the Commonwealth 
Fund concluded, ``The establishment of targets can serve both as a 
metric to guide policy development and as an incentive for all involved 
parties to act to make them effective.''
  In 1961, President Kennedy declared that within 10 years the United 
States would put a man on the Moon and return him safely. The message--
and the mission outlined--was clear. The result was a vast mobilization 
of private and public resources to achieve that purpose.
  This administration has a similar opportunity--particularly now, at 
the height of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We need to 
put the full force of American innovation and ingenuity into achieving 
a serious cost-savings target for our Nation's health care system. But 
it is hard to do that if they won't set one.
  I urge the administration to set a cost-savings target, with a number 
and a date. And then let's get to work to give American families the 
health care system they deserve. Instead of waste and inefficiency, 
poor outcomes and missed opportunities, we would have a health care 
system that is the envy of the world.
