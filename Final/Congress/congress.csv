                   SUPPORTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
express my strong support for the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act. In the past, no group has been more negatively impacted by 
rising health care costs than seniors.
  Because of the Affordable Care Act, some of the financial burdens 
have been alleviated. The Affordable Care Act has already helped to 
close the Medicare part D doughnut hole by saving 6.6 million seniors 
more than $7 billion on prescription drugs. It also provides a free 
annual wellness visit and coverage for key preventive services that 
many seniors avoid because of high cost.
  As for waste and fraud in Medicare, the Affordable Care Act 
strengthens the system and gives more effective tools to identify and 
remove the unnecessary costs.
  The Affordable Care Act not only provides essential quality care; it 
does so while lowering costs for our aging population. I am proud to 
stand with my colleagues and the President to support the Affordable 
Care Act.

                          ____________________

             OPPOSING THE REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, instead of 
taking steps to create jobs and grow the economy, Republicans yesterday 
voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 37th time.
  The Affordable Care Act is working, and its benefits are being felt 
throughout the country, especially in my home State. Almost 525,000 New 
Mexicans now have access to free preventative services, such as 
mammograms, flu shots and colonoscopy screenings. Almost 19,000 seniors 
have benefited from lower prescription drug costs, and over 26,000 
young adults in New Mexico can stay on their parents' insurance plans 
until they are 26.
  So why in the world would we want to hurt seniors, women and young 
people by repealing the Affordable Care Act?
  Let's not forget that the Affordable Care Act is a job creator. The 
Medicaid expansion alone will create 6,000 to 8,000 jobs in New Mexico 
and will pump more than $5 billion into our economy over the next 6 
years.
  Mr. Speaker, let's stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and 
let's get back to work on behalf of the American people.

                          ____________________

                  THE UNAFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reserve, on 
Wednesday, March 6, released an edition of its so-called ``beige book'' 
that said that the President's Affordable Care Act is being cited as a 
reason for layoffs and a slowdown in the economy and a slowdown in 
hiring. The beige book examines economic conditions of the Federal 
Reserve districts across the country through interviews with key 
business contacts, economists, and market experts in each district.
  The Federal Reserve noted:

       Employers in several districts cited the unknown effects of 
     the Affordable Care Act as reasons for planned layoffs and 
     reluctance to hire more staff.

  Supporters of the Affordable Care Act refer to the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office, which noted the law will have only mildly 
negative employment effects. Such defenses are far cries from the 
claims used by supporters of the bill to force passage in 2009 and 
merely remind Americans of the countless broken promises that now 
define the so-called ``Affordable Care Act.''
  The writing is on the wall, Mr. Speaker. The reality is the 
Affordable Care Act is costing American jobs. As more of its 
regulations go into effect, the more employers are going to alter their 
hiring decisions to account for its unaffordable costs.

                          ____________________

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 18, 2012

  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, millions of 
Americans are anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the 
constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Many of these individuals 
await this decision in fear, as they stand to lose their sense of 
security if the law is struck down. Since the Affordable Care Act was 
signed into law on March 23, 2010, millions of Americans have already 
benefited from its sweeping reforms, and millions more stand to benefit 
once the law is fully implemented in 2014. Texas has the highest 
percentage of adults without health insurance, and striking down the 
Affordable Care Act will only worsen this predicament for Texans.
  If the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, there will 
be no winners. The Affordable Care Act forces insurance companies to 
play by the rules, giving Americans greater control over their own 
health care. Under the health care law, insurance companies are 
required to publicly justify their actions if they chose to raise rates 
by 10 percent or more, and can no longer impose lifetime dollar limits 
on health benefits. In a major show of support, several insurance 
companies, including UnitedHealthcare and Aetna, have even pledged to 
preserve certain provisions of the health care law no matter what the 
Supreme Court decides.
  A repeal of the Affordable Care Act would further exacerbate health 
disparities between minorities and non-minorities. Minorities suffer 
disproportionately from serious illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, and 
HIV/AIDS. Historically, minorities have faced considerable barriers to 
accessing affordable health insurance, and these barriers have 
contributed to significant health disparities. Under the Affordable 
Care Act, an estimated 3.8 million African Americans and roughly 5.4 
million Latinos who would otherwise be uninsured will gain coverage by 
2016. If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, millions of minorities 
will be forced to seek primary care in our Nation's overcrowded 
emergency rooms, and the costs of care will be shifted to taxpayers.
  Mr. Speaker, while the Republicans have introduced numerous measures 
to undermine and repeal the Affordable Care Act, they have not yet 
offered one piece of legislation which would reduce health care costs 
for young adults and seniors or address the growing health disparities 
between minorities and non-minorities. As we await this monumental 
court decision, I, along with my Democratic colleagues, will continue 
to advocate for access to affordable, quality health care for all 
Americans.

                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORIES

  (Ms. LEE of California asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is 
already improving access to quality affordable health care for 
millions, including my constituents.
  In my home State, for example, Covered California is a shining 
example of how the Affordable Care Act, when implemented fully, will be 
a success. California's exchange is now enrolling thousands of 
Californians into health care coverage every day.
  Residents in my district, ranging from young adults, to seniors, to 
children with preexisting conditions and those who cannot afford health 
insurance, have been receiving critical protections and savings because 
of the Affordable Care Act.
  In fact, one constituent wrote me recently after receiving a letter 
from his insurance company. After looking at the plans offered through 
Covered California, he was able to find coverage that was both more 
affordable and better for him. He told me that he does not want to put 
insurance companies back in charge and pay higher premiums for less 
coverage.
  Every time Republicans vote to repeal or dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act, they make it perfectly clear that charging women more for 
being a woman is okay, that denying victims of domestic violence 
coverage is okay, and allowing insurance companies to increase premiums 
to increase profits is okay.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the chaplain of the day asked God to look 
over this Congress. I ask God and think the preacher should have asked 
for direction a little bit further, to look over the Supreme Court, 
because the Supreme Court has in its hands the Affordable Care Act.
  A report was just issued yesterday that said in my home city of 
Memphis, African American women are twice as likely to die of breast 
cancer than Caucasian women. That's unacceptable.
  Part of that is because they don't get the health care they need. The 
Affordable Care Act will see to it that everybody gets access to 
affordable health care, that there won't be a disparity of twice as 
much for the cost of insurance for women than men, and that mammograms 
will be offered to people, ladies, without a co-pay.
  If the Affordable Care Act passes, that disparity in health between 
white women and black women in my city and in America will end. That is 
wrong.
  Part of what's happened in my city is a vestige of Jim Crow, and even 
though those laws have been repealed, we still suffer from them, and 
there is a lot in the Affordable Care Act that will end those. I hope 
the Supreme Court rules on the side of life.

                               speech of

                         HON. YVETTE D. CLARKE

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 16, 2013

  Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 45--To 
Repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and health care-
related provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
of 2010. This legislation would completely repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, which was signed into law in 2010 and was declared 
constitutionally sound by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The 
Affordable Care Act extends healthcare coverage to all Americans 
regardless of their gender, health condition or ability to pay.
  It is a disgrace that this country, which is the wealthiest country 
in the world, denies universal healthcare coverage to its citizens. 
Repealing the Affordable Care Act will allow this disgrace to continue.
  The Affordable Care Act is a good law. Because of the Affordable Care 
Act, Americans now have access to a wide variety of free preventive 
services; insurers can no longer drop women from coverage when they 
become pregnant; Medicare is stronger due to some of the cost savings 
and other provisions in the act; Seniors are paying less for 
prescription drugs; Americans no longer face lifetime limits on care; 
and families are receiving rebates from insurance companies, when they 
unfairly inflate their costs.
  In fact, thousands of people in my district, the 9th Congressional 
District of Brooklyn, New York, are already benefiting from the 
Affordable Care Act. An analysis done in March of 2012 showed that the 
health care reform law had already:
  Provided 390 small businesses in my district with tax credits to help 
maintain or expand health care coverage for their employees;
  Provided 5,100 young adults in my district with access to health 
insurance coverage under their parents' insurance plan;
  Provided Medicare preventive services, at no costs to the patient, 
for 46,000 seniors in the district;
  And, provided $2.5 million in public health grants for community 
health centers, hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers in 
the district to improve the community's health.
  I have always believed that healthcare is a fundamental right, not a 
privilege. And this is why I vehemently oppose H.R. 45--To Repeal the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It is wrong, and it is a 
step backwards for our country.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Jeffries) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, later on this afternoon, the House will 
vote for the 37th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The Speaker of the House of Representatives has already been on 
record saying that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. So 
it's just not clear to me why we are wasting the time and the treasure 
of the American people on another futile legislative fantasy.
  In fact, it's a legislative fantasy that has cost the American people 
more than $50 million. If, in fact, the Affordable Care Act were to be 
repealed, it would do even more damage, as independent economists have 
estimated that a repeal would add to the Federal deficit by more than 
$100 billion.
  It's often been said that the classic definition of ``insanity'' is 
doing the same thing over and over and over again but somehow expecting 
a different result.
  Barack Obama was elected President in 2008. The Affordable Care Act 
was signed into law in 2010. The Supreme Court, with the Chief Justice 
voting in the majority, held that the Affordable Care Act was 
constitutional in 2012. A few months later, President Barack Obama was 
reelected in an electoral college landslide. Yet, later on this 
afternoon, we're voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 37th 
time--over and over and over again. It's a classic definition of 
legislative insanity, as if the 37th vote is going to be any different, 
will yield any different results than the previous 36 where we've 
wasted the taxpayer dollars of the American people.
  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, and that's a good 
thing. It's a good thing because over the next decade more than 30 
million Americans who otherwise would not have had health care 
insurance will be insured. It seems to me that that's a good thing.
  The Affordable Care Act makes sure that insurance companies cannot 
deny medical coverage for preexisting conditions. It seems to me that 
that's a good thing.
  The Affordable Care Act provides small businesses with a 35 percent 
tax credit, which will enable these small businesses to continue to 
grow and to flourish. It seems to me that that's a good thing.
  The Affordable Care Act allows young Americans who are just starting 
out to remain on the insurance plan of their parents until the age of 
26, giving them a real chance to get themselves started in their 
pursuit of the American Dream. I'm new, but it seems to me that that's 
a good thing.
  Yet later on this afternoon, for the 37th time, we're engaging in 
another futile legislative fantasy.
  There are a couple of other things that we could be doing. We could 
be dealing with the sequester, $85 billion in random cuts that are 
costing the economy more than 500,000 jobs, but we're not.
  We could be debating the American Jobs Act, trying to put the people 
of this great country back to work and stimulate the economy, but we're 
not.
  We could be trying to get a budget, go to conference, create some 
certainty for industry and the American people, but we're not.
  Madam Speaker, I'm hopeful that after this vote is taken, we can 
finally come to the reality that the Affordable Care Act is the law of 
the land, it's good for the American people, and we should get back to 
doing things that will advance prosperity in this great country.

                     AMEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, this week I introduced legislation that 
will amend the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare, to 
prohibit a bailout for the insurance industry that is currently 
authorized under section 1341 and section 1342 of the Affordable Care 
Act.
  The American people have had enough of bailouts for Big Business. It 
is time for this culture of corporate cronyism that has become a 
dominant part of Washington, D.C., to stop. My legislation, No Bailouts 
for the Insurance Industry Act of 2014, would amend the Affordable Care 
Act to repeal section 1341, the ``reinsurance'' fund, and section 1342, 
the ``risk corridor'' provision.
  Together, both can provide for a massive taxpayer bailout to cover 
the insurance industry losses. The taxpayers should not be on the hook 
for the failures of ObamaCare. Any reasonable person can see that this 
scheme isn't going to work, and the American people should not be 
forced to bail it out once it fails.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of the No Bailouts for the Insurance 
Industry Act of 2014.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to tell the story of the 
Montez Family, who live in my congressional district in Colorado.
  They live in Arvada, Colorado, and because of the Affordable Care 
Act, they will now be able to afford health insurance. This is a 
success story of the Affordable Care Act and of its improving access to 
quality, affordable health care.
  Both Joaquin and Rosalee Montez are employed, but neither of their 
employers provides coverage to their employees. They have a daughter in 
college, a 13-year-old son, and a 4-year-old daughter. With rates 
ranging from $450 to $600 per month, purchasing private insurance was 
too expensive for the Montez Family, especially with three kids, a 
house payment, and a car payment. Due to a constrained budget, the only 
time the kids were receiving health care was when they were ``really, 
really, really sick,'' and always at an urgent care center. One time 
after their daughter got E. coli, the Montez Family was stuck with a 
$17,000 hospital bill.
  Thanks to the help of a navigator, they were able to get insurance 
through the Affordable Care Act, which is a success for this Nation.

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House

for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues this morning 
talked about creating jobs, and I am delighted to be one of those who 
saw and advocated in the Affordable Care Act the expansion of service 
and use on behalf of the American people.
  First, as a woman, let me say for women, the Affordable Care Act will 
take away forever this dastardly assessment that pregnancy was a 
preexisting disease. The lifetime caps will be removed for women. The 
costs are going down for women. In fact, a small business owner 
indicated that she was going to save $10,000 on her insurance.
  This creates jobs, scholarships for medical professionals, doctors, 
nurses, and expands the federally-qualified clinics.
  The Affordable Care Act is here to stay, with consumer protection 
that will provide for the right kind of health care for the American 
people.
  Don't be fooled. It is going to be the civil rights legislation of 
the 21st century: women given dignity, children provided health care, 
seniors not denied health care.
  I am delighted that this particular legislation is going to be what 
we desired it to be: civil rights and health care for all Americans.

                 IN SUPPORT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in continued support of 
the Affordable Care Act and the promise of high quality, affordable 
health care for all.
  Republicans and right-wing media are obsessed with problems about 
healthcare.gov. This law is more than just a Web site. It is 
affordable, quality health insurance for everyone. The majority of 
Americans who purchase their insurance purchase it outside of the 
individual market plan. Those individuals who purchase through their 
employers' offerings will suffer a price increase if the Upton 
legislation, which will be coming before us shortly,

[[Page H7066]]

passes. It is just a means to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, and I 
will not be in support of it.
  There are over 100,000 people who have now been able to obtain 
insurance under the Affordable Care Act. It is working. We need to work 
to improve it. I stand ready to do so.

                   THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS WORKING

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is more than a Web 
site; it is affordable, quality health insurance made available to 
everyone.
  While my friends on the other side of the aisle like to keep talking 
about bad stories, there are some good stories about the Affordable 
Care Act, and I have one of them. It is Sarah and Joe, parents of two 
small children from Los Angeles, who have been working very hard every 
day to provide for their family while they were paying a high health 
care premium every month.
  Just last month, they were paying $1,259 a month for COBRA. Last 
week, they got on the exchange, and they enrolled in a Blue Cross 
Silver 70 plan and are now paying more than $400 less a month--less a 
month. Sarah shared with us:

       We are a family of four with two young kids. Regular access 
     to doctors is a must for us.

  This plan does that.
  The recent problems people have encountered on the Web site are 
unacceptable, and they are being fixed. Let's not allow these temporary 
glitches to overshadow the life-changing benefits that the Affordable 
Care Act is bringing to millions of American families like Sarah and 
Joe.

 OPPOSING THE CR THAT DELAYS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE 
                                  ACT

  (Ms. CLARKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, at the time that President Obama was first 
inaugurated, it was clear to most Americans that we had a crisis in the 
health care system: the cost of premiums was skyrocketing every year, 
millions of American families did not have health insurance, and many 
of the health insurance plans that existed were inadequate, providing 
coverage that was essentially useless when someone had a serious health 
problem or a preexisting condition. Our seniors enrolled in Medicare 
were, in many instances, paying hundreds of dollars each month for 
drugs.
  Now the Affordable Care Act in immediate effect addresses this 
crisis. Already, the Affordable Care Act has permitted millions of 
Americans to visit a primary care physician without copayments, 
prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against people with 
preexisting conditions, and now parents are keeping their children on 
their health insurance plans until they're 26 years of age.
  As of Tuesday, across our great Nation, people without health 
insurance at long last have the ability to enroll in health care 
exchanges. The Affordable Care Act, it's the law of the land.

   WOMEN'S HEALTH WEDNESDAY: AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S BENEFITS FOR WOMEN

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, for decades, women 
in this country have unfairly borne the burden of excessive health care 
costs. Fortunately, through the Affordable Care Act, millions of women 
no longer have to worry about going bankrupt if they get sick.
  The Affordable Care Act ensures that being a woman will no longer be 
treated as a preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act bans 
insurance companies from requiring women to obtain a referral for 
access to necessary OB/GYN care and bans insurance companies from 
dropping women when they get sick or pregnant.
  Despite these accomplishments in women's health, the war on women 
continues in Texas. Governor Perry's political decision to forgo nearly 
$40 million in Federal funding for the Texas Medicaid Women's Health 
Program will leave 130,000 women without access to preventative health 
services.
  Despite these obstacles, I will continue to fight for the increased 
access to quality health care for women in Texas.

                     REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, just last week the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office served a devastating blow to 
President Obama's most frequently uttered promise during debate over 
the Affordable Care Act: ``If you like your present coverage, you can 
keep it.''
  The CBO predicted the law would lead to a net loss of employer-based 
insurance coverage for between three and five million people each year 
between the years of 2019 and 2022, with as many as 20 million 
Americans losing their current insurance plans.
  Now, as we approach the second anniversary of the Affordable Care 
Act, the full impact of this law remains unknown. However, a few things 
are quite clear. Supporters said it would lower costs. It hasn't. They 
said it would improve quality. It hasn't. The President said you can 
keep your current plan if you like it. This clearly is not the case.
  By the administration's own estimates, the new health care 
regulations will force most firms, and up to 80 percent of small 
businesses, to give up their current plans by 2013.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people can't afford another year of the so-
called Affordable Care Act.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. HORSFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, it is past time for this Congress to 
work together to improve the Affordable Care Act. This law can be 
improved, but it is also helping people throughout this country and in 
my home State of Nevada.
  One example that I would like to share with you today is that of 
Michelle, a constituent from Pahrump, Nevada. Michelle enrolled in a 
plan on the exchange that will save her $200 per month and allow her 
access to OB-GYN services closer to home. She called her enrollment in 
the program an overwhelmingly positive experience.
  Michelle is currently on a HIPAA-guaranteed plan that costs her $565 
a month. If she gets sick and needs an urgent visit, mammogram or other 
OB-GYN services, she has to drive to Las Vegas from Pahrump.
  After enrolling in the Affordable Care Act, she will save more than 
$200 a month and have access to local urgent visit and OB-GYN services 
in Pahrump.
  Madam Speaker, now is not the time to turn back the clock or leave 
constituents like Michelle behind. If Republicans are successful in 
defunding or even delaying the Affordable Care Act, Michelle will lack 
insurance. She will have to go back to the predatory plan that offered 
her no real coverage and costs even more.
  I ask my colleagues on the other side, let's work together to make 
the Affordable Care Act work for the American people.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND 
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. LAURA RICHARDSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, March 21, 2012

  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the second 
anniversary of the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act. In the two years since its enactment, the Affordable Care Act 
has been good for seniors, good for women, good for small businesses, 
and good for all Americans.
  As the Affordable Care Act is implemented, it will continue to expand 
access to affordable, quality health care for over 30 million Americans 
and will work to reign in the ever-escalating costs of health care. 
Passage of the Affordable Care Act was a major step toward fulfilling 
the promise all Americans were pledged: the promise of unalienable 
rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness which quality 
healthcare embodies.
  For the people I represent in the 37th District of California, the 
Affordable Care Act will improve coverage for 299,000 residents who 
already have insurance. It will give tax credits and other assistance 
to up to 146,000 families and 15,100 small businesses to help them 
afford coverage. Health care reform will also improve Medicare for 
63,000 beneficiaries in my district, including closing the prescription 
drug ``donut hole'' once and for all.
  In 2010, the Affordable Care Act made it possible for 354,592 
Medicare beneficiaries in California to receive a $250 rebate to help 
cover the cost of their prescription drugs when they hit the donut 
hole. In 2011, 319,429 Medicare beneficiaries received a 50 percent 
discount--an average savings of $538 per person--on brand-name 
prescription drugs when they hit the coverage gap. That's a total 
savings of over $171 million for seniors in California alone! In my 
district, 3,200 seniors received prescription drug discounts worth $1.5 
million, an average discount of $460 per senior.
  The Affordable Care Act extends coverage to 92,500 uninsured 
residents of the 37th District and will guarantee that 17,500 residents 
with pre-existing conditions can obtain the health insurance they need. 
Since enactment, health care reform has extended insurance coverage to 
5,599 Californians through the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance 
Plan.
  The Affordable Care Act protects 1,100 families from bankruptcy due 
to unaffordable health care costs and currently allows 59,000 young 
adults to obtain coverage on their parents' insurance plans. The new 
law provides millions of dollars in new funding for 11 community health 
centers in my district. And finally, it will reduce the cost of 
uncompensated care for hospitals and other health care providers by 
$125 million annually.
  Mr. Speaker, as we approach the two year anniversary of the enactment 
of the Affordable Care Act, an attack on women's access to affordable, 
quality, and necessary healthcare services is underway. From the 
comments made by Rush Limbaugh about Georgetown Law Student Sandra 
Fluke, to Republican attempts to roll back coverage and restrict access 
to birth control, the GOP's war on women stands in stark contrast 
to the Administration's goal of ensuring that women have access to the 
healthcare services they need to remain healthy.

  As a female Member of Congress, I understand that women have unique 
health care needs, and are often the ones who make health care 
decisions for their families. I voted for and strongly support the 
Affordable Care Act because it provides important benefits for women 
and their families. The Affordable Care Act helps women by eliminating 
the discriminatory gender rating system, making sure that insurance 
companies do not consider pregnancy grounds for denying coverage, and 
doing away with all pre-existing conditions.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all Americans joining new 
insurance plans have the freedom to choose from any primary care 
provider, OB-GYN, or pediatrician in their health plan's network, or 
emergency care outside of the plan's network, without a referral. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, women joining a new health care plan can 
receive recommended preventive services, like mammograms, new baby care 
and well-child visits, and an annual wellness visit with no out-of-
pocket costs. In 2011, over 6 million people with private insurance 
coverage in California gained preventative service coverage with no 
cost sharing as a result of the Affordable Care Act.
  Before enactment of the Affordable Care Act, women could be charged 
more for individual insurance policies simply because of their gender. 
A 22-year-old woman could be charged 150 percent the premium that a 22-
year-old man paid. In 2014, insurers will not be able to charge women 
higher premiums than they charge men. The law takes strong action to 
control health care costs, including helping states crack down on 
excessive premium increases and making sure most of your premium 
dollars go toward your health care.
  The Affordable Care Act also allows young adults under the age of 26 
to stay on their parents' health insurance plan. This provision has 
expanded access to health insurance coverage for 2.5 million young 
people nationwide. In my district, 7,000 young adults have taken 
advantage of this provision and are now covered under their parents' 
plan.

[[Page E405]]

  This week, the House will consider a bill to repeal the Independent 
Payment Advisory Board established under the Affordable Care Act. 
Having previously garnered bipartisan support, the majority's decision 
to attach a medical liability provision to the underlying piece of 
legislation amounts to nothing short of a partisan ploy to score points 
with their base.
  The language attached to the bill would place caps on medical 
malpractice awards for pain and suffering at $250,000 and would 
override most state tort laws. Unfortunately, the majority's decision 
to include tort reform language on a completely unrelated measure 
demonstrates their refusal to work with Members across the aisle in 
order to further strengthen the Affordable Care Act.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act provides American families with 
stability and peace of mind. Never again will they have to choose 
between their health and their livelihood. As a result of the 
Affordable Care Act, 23,000 children and 90,000 adults in my district 
now have health insurance that covers preventive services without 
paying any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles.
  I am proud to be a part of this historic health care policy change, 
and to be part of the days ahead in which we will work to further 
strengthen it.

                     THANK YOU, AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. BROWN of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, my fellow Americans, the results 
are in with the closing of the Affordable Care Act's first-time open 
enrollment period: over 7 million Americans have now secured quality, 
affordable health care coverage for themselves and their families.
  I want to congratulate everyone who signed up. I personally called 
over 30,000 people to encourage them to sign up, and worked at one of 
the sign-up sites over the weekend.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no American could ever again be 
denied coverage for a preexisting condition; no woman can ever again be 
charged a higher premium just because she is a woman; 3 million young 
Americans age 26 and under can stay on their family plan; no American 
ever again will have to worry that one major illness will bankrupt 
their family; no senior will ever have to pay a copayment for key 
preventative services such as cancer screening.
  I want to thank everyone for signing up and not going for the 
okeydoke.

             AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office, CBO, issued a report stating the 
Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare, will slow economic 
growth over the next decade substantially more than previously 
predicted. According to yesterday's report, the Affordable Care Act 
could lead to 2 million fewer workers in the workforce between now and 
2017, which is nearly three times as high as CBO's earlier predictions. 
What is even worse, this number is supposed to rise in later years to 
the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs by 2024.
  According to The Hill newspaper:

       The agency, CBO, also said employer penalties in the law 
     would decrease wages, and part-year workers would be slower 
     to return to the workforce because they would seek to retain 
     ObamaCare insurance subsidies.

  We cannot afford more blows to jobs. We cannot afford more blows to 
the American workforce. We cannot afford more blows to our economy. We 
as policymakers should be focused on breaking down barriers to 
employment in order to increase wages.
  Mr. Speaker, the administration better get better at explaining this 
law to the American people or start working with this body to repeal 
and fix it. The American people deserve better. The American people 
deserve jobs.

            AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STANDS ON A SAND FOUNDATION

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, even the White House's best ObamaCare damage 
control efforts, waivers, delays, penalty deadline, adjustments, and 
temporary fixes sadly leave the so-called Affordable Care Act's sand 
foundation untouched.
  Math undergirding the entire law remains structurally unsound and 
threatens the broader insurance market in this country. That is a shame 
for each and every American.
  As someone who wants to see greater access and affordability in 
health care, and more options for Americans in the individual insurance 
market, it is my hope that the country moves toward a competitive, 
patient-centered system like the one outlined by the House Republican 
Study Committee in the American Health Care Reform Act.
  Something as transformative as health care policy should never be 
forced on the American people on an embarrassingly unstudied and purely 
partisan basis, the way President Obama chose to proceed with the 
Affordable Care Act.

                 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WEB SITE PROBLEMS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, earlier this fall the President said the 
Affordable Care Act is more than just a Web site and that the problems 
with the Web site will soon be fixed. While I don't disagree with 
either of those two statements, I don't understand the timeline 
involved because yesterday in the Oversight and Investigation 
Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the deputy chief 
information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
told us that the Web site was launched, but it wasn't finished upon 
launch.
  I have to ask: Why in the world would they proceed with this if they 
knew it wasn't finished? When asked to give a percentage completion, it 
was confusing. His answer was either 40 or 60 percent; no one really 
knows, and here is the kicker. When you get to January and providers, 
doctors, and hospitals are seeing patients who think they have coverage 
under the Affordable Care Act, part of the problem with the unfinished 
Web site is there may be difficulty in delivering provider payments. 
That is an intolerable situation that must be resolved and must be 
resolved quickly. It could start with the administration being honest 
with the committee about where they are in the development of the Web 
site.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that the robust 
provisions passed in the House were significantly reduced in the 
Senate, the people of the Virgin Islands are benefiting in many ways 
from the Affordable Care Act.
  As an example, a physician related to me that the insured 21- to 25-
year-olds and the preventive care without copay kept her practice 
afloat, and the insurance rebate and tax credits for small businesses 
enabled her to provide insurance for her employees without requiring 
contributions from them.
  In addition, seniors and people with disabilities saved an average of 
$647 on medicines. Health centers in my district were able to expand 
space and services; children with sickle cell, asthma, and diabetes 
could be insured; every newborn will get an important home visit; and 
the new Medicaid dollars will enable us to provide coverage for up to 
half of our now uninsured.
  We still have work to do to ensure full access in the Virgin Islands 
and the Nation, but the Affordable Care Act has already made a positive 
difference in the lives of many of our constituents. The ACA is helping 
Americans in all of the States and territories, and we will continue to 
build on its successes, not yield to Republican opportunism and 
obstructionism.

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA Mr. Speaker, again, on the front of the Affordable Care 
Act we have yet another business--this one in northern California, in 
Paradise, California--called California Vocations.
  This is a nonprofit group that helps people with developmental 
disabilities to find employment. This organization has had to drop for 
90 employees its health care coverage because it cannot afford it under 
the Affordable Care Act.
  This week, we will be taking up legislation to give people the 
opportunity, if they like their health insurance, to be able to keep 
it, as was promised by the President. We need to move on this measure 
in order to help the President to keep the promise that he said or 
implied, but more importantly, the promise to the American people that 
they have choice, that they have freedom in this country to make their 
own decisions, not have the heavyhanded government deciding for them 
something that doesn't work or they cannot afford.

         IMPACT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES

  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, during a hearing on the 
Education and Workforce Committee, Secretary Sebelius dismissed 
concerns regarding the impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on 
small businesses as ``speculation.''
  But in my district--and all across this country--the negative impact 
of this law is a sad reality. I've held field hearings in Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, and most recently North Carolina to hear directly from 
job creators about how they will have to cut hours or hire fewer 
employees because of the Affordable Care Act.
  Just this past Sunday, my hometown paper, the Johnson City Press, ran 
an advertisement from a Burger King franchisee owner announcing he was 
being forced to close one of his stores as a result of, among other 
things, ``a law so unfriendly to business and workers it forces the 
business to limit hardworking Americans to less hours and lower pay at 
a time of high unemployment and less opportunity for people to 
prevail.''
  This entrepreneur wants to grow his business, not shrink it. But 
instead, we are limiting his opportunities and those of Tennesseans 
that he would employ. Speculation? I hardly think so. We can--and 
must--do better.

                $1 TRILLION HIKE FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, 2013, brand-new year, brand-new Congress. 
But what's this year also bringing? How about some brand-new taxes 
under the Affordable Care Act.
  There is a medical device tax that started on January 1 of 2.3 
percent on gross sales. This means some of our smallest companies, 
medical start-up companies, are going to pay a tax not on profits but 
their gross receipts.
  The flexible spending account that many families rely upon to pay for 
recurring expenses with pre-tax dollars, especially those families with 
special needs children, those are now capped at $2,500.
  Investment income, a surtax of 3.8 percent for people who earn above 
a certain level.
  Taxes on medical deductions, it rises from a 7.5 percent reduction to 
10 percent on adjusted gross income. That means our sickest 
constituents are going to be paying more taxes.
  And then, finally, the Medicare payroll tax hike. For the first time, 
individuals who earn investment income are going to be paying a payroll 
tax of .9 percent. There will be an additional .9 percent on other 
income as well.
  Let's be honest, the Affordable Care Act benefits are still over a 
year away, but boy, you got a big tax bill January 1.

 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 45, REPEAL OF PATIENT PROTECTION

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 16, 2013

  Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, the GOP needs to reorder its priorities. 
The American people want us to focus on jobs and strengthening our 
economy, instead of relitigating the past. Today is the 37th time the 
majority has taken up repealing patient protections for the American 
people. This is a very bad idea.
   Since January 2011, the House has been in session and held votes on 
only 281 days. Forty-three of those days have been spent on repealing 
the Affordable Care Act alone. That's 15 percent of the American 
people's time spent solely on failed attempts to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act.
   For the party that's seeking to cut their way to prosperity, 
consider this: based on the cost per day to run Congress, the 
Congressional Research Service calculated that the time spent 
attempting to repeal the health law has come with a $52.4 million price 
tag for taxpayers. This money could restore the estimated $41 million 
cut under sequestration to Meals on Wheels nutrition programs across 
the country. Or it could pay for nearly 7,000 children to participate 
in the Head Start program for a year.
   Now, consider the benefits the American people have enjoyed since 
the Affordable Care Act became law: children no longer face 
discrimination due to pre-existing conditions; students and young 
adults are gaining coverage through their parents' plans; Medicare is 
stronger, and seniors are paying less for prescription drugs and 
getting better treatment at lower cost; Americans no longer face 
lifetime limits; families are receiving rebates from insurance 
companies; and women have access to a wide range of free preventive 
services.
  Since the law was enacted in March 2010, over 800,000 jobs have been 
created in the health care industry. So when the GOP says the 
Affordable Care Act is ``killing jobs,'' it's flat out wrong.
   Repealing the Affordable Care Act would leave millions of Americans 
without vital patient protections and has cost the American people 
precious time and money. We should instead vote for legislation to 
create jobs, expand our economy, and strengthen the middle class.

                   REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
urge my Republican colleagues to move beyond the attacks on health care 
for Americans and to move forward by getting our country back to work.
  The majority thinks that it's a badge of honor to claim that it will 
have had 31 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I completely 
disagree.
  They will have voted 31 times to strip patients of basic protections. 
They will have voted 31 times to reverse the progress made by the 
Affordable Care Act, including protecting up to 17 million children who 
now have coverage even if they have preexisting conditions. In fact, 
the 31st vote that we will take is nothing more than a reaction to 
Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion that the law is constitutional. Yet 
the GOP continues to dispute this. Let's move on.
  If they were serious, they would have presented us with a plan 31 
votes ago to help us fix any flaws that this law may have. So I plead 
for the 31st time: let's get back to work.

LET'S NOT PLAY POLITICS WITH THE PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, on June 28 the United States Supreme 
Court ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was 
constitutional. It is now the law of the land, thanks in most part to 
Republican-appointed Chief Justice Roberts.
  Tomorrow, this House is expected to vote on the repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act. Vote again--remember H.R. 2 on January 19 and now 
H.R. 6079. It is, unfortunately, expected that, due to the Republican 
vote, that it will be repealed again.
  How sad, Madam Speaker. How can you face the seniors, the students, 
the women and children and small businesses with this level of 
uncertainty by trying to repeal it again? They are the primary 
beneficiaries.
  Can you explain why? Can you especially explain how this is going to 
add to the deficit? The CBO says so. $100 billion in 10 years, and $1 
trillion in 20 years.
  Madam Speaker, let's not play politics with one of the most important 
pieces of legislation that we have passed.

        HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I stood here 2 days ago addressing the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and reviewing its benefits. 
I stand here today after the landmark Supreme Court decision to make 
people aware of the Republicans' efforts to repeal this historic piece 
of legislation.
  The stakeholders must remember: seniors, the benefits with the 
prescription drugs already benefiting with $3.7 billion in savings; 
young adults who stay on their parents' plan until the age of 26, 6.6 
million of you; small businesses who will experience tax credits of up 
to 50 percent by the year 2014; and women, women who suffered 
discrimination in premiums and on preexisting conditions like 
pregnancy. Imagine being defined a preexisting condition. 2014 they 
will stop.
  These are just highlights, and this is why we need to, again, focus 
behind the Affordable Care Act and remember, it's the largest part of 
our GDP that keeps growing; and we need to have it under control in 
order to have our great economy.

                      AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DECISION

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, as a former judge of the North Carolina 
State Supreme Court, I've come to the well today to applaud the United 
States Supreme Court for its courage and for ruling on the side of 
constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. This is a win, Mr. 
Speaker, for 48 million Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, who 
will receive stable, secure, and affordable health coverage forever.
  I believe that much of the public confusion surrounding the bill was 
because Americans outside of the Washington Beltway simply did not 
understand what the Affordable Care Act means for them. So to put it 
plainly, Americans can now enjoy coverage without worry or jeopardy, 
regardless of preexisting conditions. Uninsured young people up to age 
26 will be able to receive coverage. If you become gravely ill, there 
are no limits on your benefits. If you are a woman, you can't be 
charged higher premiums. If you need preventive care, you won't have a 
copay or deductible. If you lose your job, you won't lose your 
coverage. And if your employer doesn't provide coverage, you will be 
able to buy it at affordable prices.
  The political theater Republicans orchestrated around health care is 
over. Congress debated, the Court decided. This is done.

            RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, tomorrow the United States Supreme Court 
is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care 
Act.
  Let us all step back and recognize those portions that people like. 
These are the highlights: For seniors, it closes the infamous doughnut 
hole for prescription drugs. This means, to date, about 5.3 million 
seniors have experienced savings of $3.7 billion. That doughnut hole 
will close completely by the year 2020.
  For women, we no longer are going to suffer the discrimination 
against us. Ninety percent of the plans today charge more for women 
than they do for men for the same process. In 2014, this stops. Women 
can no longer be discriminated against for what they call preexisting 
conditions. Do you know what these preexisting conditions are? Breast 
cancer, C-section and childbirth, pregnancy, victims of domestic abuse.
  And there will be a ban on maximum coverage in your lifetime for 
medical care. You will no longer need to have a referral to go see an 
OB/GYN. Children will also benefit.
  Madam Speaker, let's all recognize the value of the Affordable Care 
Act.

               WOMEN'S HEALTH AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, among the many beneficial reforms for 
women in the Affordable Care Act passed 2 years ago this week is an end 
to the discriminatory practice of gender rating in which individual 
women are charged more than men for the same coverage. We know for a 
fact that these sorts of discriminatory policies are not something that 
insurers would just change on their own.
  According to a report that the National Women's Law Center released 
earlier this week, over 90 percent of the best-selling plans in States 
that have not already banned gender rating still charge women more than 
men for the very same coverage. This costs women and their families 
approximately $1 billion a year. Because we fought--and we fought hard 
2 years ago--gender rating will be a thing of the past in 2014. At long 
last, a woman's health will be put on equal footing with that of her 
spouse, her son, or her brother.
  This is just one of the many benefits for women in the Affordable 
Care Act. I could not be more proud to have helped pass this piece of 
legislation, which will transform women's health in this country.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. PINGREE of Maine asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PINGREE of Maine. Madam Speaker, in the 2 years since its 
enactment, the Affordable Care Act has truly improved health care for 
families in Maine:
  It has given 190,000 seniors access to free preventative care and 
saved them over $5 million in prescription drug costs; it has allowed 
7,000 young adults to stay on their parents' insurance; and, in Maine, 
it has helped 1,300 small businesses provide their employees with 
health coverage.
  More critical benefits are on the way, including banning insurance 
companies from charging women more simply because of their gender.
  Yet here we are again, debating how to undo these successes, debating 
how to block women's access to contraceptives, and, this week, 
considering proposals to dismantle Medicare and shift the cost back to 
seniors.
  This must stop. We can't afford to go back to the status quo--denying 
women equal access to care, or telling seniors they're on their own, or 
letting families go bankrupt just because someone got sick.
  We must let the Affordable Care Act stand so more Americans have the 
chance to reap the benefits of true health care reform.

               THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S IMPACT ON WOMEN

  (Ms. FUDGE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, the National Women's Law Center recently 
reported that 90 percent of the best selling health plans charge women 
more than men for the same coverage. In addition, insurers have 
classified millions of women as having preexisting conditions because 
of a previous cesarean section or having been pregnant, even for being 
a victim of domestic violence.
  For decades, women have unfairly been charged excessive costs for 
their health care. Well, that changes now. Because of the Affordable 
Care Act, the discriminatory practice known as ``gender rating,'' or 
charging women more than men for care, will be prohibited starting in 
2014; and women in private plans can obtain free lifesaving procedures, 
such as mammograms and colonoscopies.
  The Affordable Care Act bans insurance companies from imposing 
lifetime limits on care, so Americans will not go bankrupt simply 
because they are trying to be healthy.
  And in 2014, because of health care reform, women cannot be denied 
access because of a preexisting condition.
  There is no better time than today to stand up and demand quality, 
accessible health care for women.

                REJECTING REPEAL OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my 
constituent, David Zoltan-Breiger, 33 years old, who now has coverage 
under Illinois' Pre-Existing Condition Plan thanks to the Affordable 
Care Act.
  David has diabetes. Because of his preexisting condition, he couldn't 
get insurance for over 2 years after losing his job. David is 
absolutely elated that he no longer has to wait for hours in the 
emergency room to get lifesaving insulin. Without coverage, the ER was 
his only option. Instead, he now has regular visits with the doctor and 
can avoid the medical crises that had become a frequent nightmare.
  What happens to David under repeal of the bill? He, like so many 
others, would lose coverage and once again be at the mercy of insurance 
companies.
  We cannot go back. We must reject the Republican call for repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act.

                   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORY

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I have risen before to talk about the fact 
that the congressional district that I represent has the highest 
uninsured rate out of any congressional district in the entire country.
  About 40 percent of the constituents that I represent don't have 
health care insurance, and I wanted to talk today about how the 
Affordable Care Act is already helping many of those constituents in 
the very district that I represent.
  Yesterday, I found out that a constituent who resides in the district 
I represent, Jason Roberts, had suffered from cancer and that he had 
been running out of options, but when the Affordable Care Act kicked 
in, he found out that his COBRA benefits would be saved.
  Because of the options offered through the Affordable Care Act, 
Jason, who, again, had suffered from cancer, he actually dropped his 
monthly premiums by $251 and his deductible by $1,500. That is an 
overall savings of about $4,500 a year for what Jason describes as 
``great coverage.''
  The simple fact that he and so many others are actually able to keep 
their insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition like Jason 
had with cancer, is a true testament to the benefits of the health care 
law.
  Let's work together to make sure that this health care law works for 
all of the uninsured like Jason and that it continues to work for all 
Americans.

             LET THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WORK FOR FAMILIES

  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I want to share a letter I received from a 
constituent of mine named Mary Ann from Milford, Connecticut. She is 
suffering from cancer, and she wrote to me during the recent Republican 
government shutdown. She wrote:

       I'm attaching a picture I snapped of the statement I 
     received from my insurance company regarding my chemotherapy 
     treatment of the month of July, which was one treatment.

  Over $110,000.

       I'm grateful I have insurance right now, but it's COBRA. It 
     is expensive, and it runs out in 18 months. If the Affordable 
     Care Act is not in place in 18 months, I will never be able 
     to get insurance or treatment.
       This is real for me. It is life or death for me, and I am 
     grateful that President Obama is not willing to negotiate 
     with my life as this Nation is held hostage by political 
     terrorists.

  Mr. Speaker, I receive calls and letters like this every single week. 
The Affordable Care Act is already making a profound difference for 
individuals and their families. Those on the other side of the aisle 
who talk about it is not necessary, they have health insurance. They 
have it.
  Why is it that this body goes on to say ``no'' to health insurance 
for millions of Americans who are out there? This body needs to stop 
partisan political games and let the Affordable Care Act work for 
families. It is a matter of life or death.

               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the signing of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act was historic. In addition to providing coverage and 
lowering health insurance costs for millions of Americans, the 
legislation will truly transform how care is delivered in the United 
States. As part of this new law, we are improving Medicare for the 
seniors and people with disabilities who depend on the program, 
extending the solvency of the program, and closing the prescription 
drug doughnut hole.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act creates the 
Independent Payment Advisory Board, IPAB. The Finance Committee, led by 
Chairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller, devised the board to provide 
reason and expertise to Medicare payment policy. Experts have concluded 
that the board will in fact bend the cost curve, achieving key goals of 
health reform: lowering costs overall and increasing Medicare's 
longevity.
  Built into the IPAB are protections for beneficiaries from limits on 
care and increased costs. The Senate will ensure that the new board 
operates in a transparent way with input from patients, providers, and 
experts to guarantee the best outcomes and continued access to care. 
Moreover, we in the Senate will oversee Medicare and the IPAB to 
protect the seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare is one of 
our most treasured programs, and the IPAB will only improve the program 
for beneficiaries in the future.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 28, 2012

  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, after two years battling in the courts I 
am proud to announce today that the Supreme Court has upheld the 
Affordable Care Act. This has been a long and difficult fight, but I 
can say without a doubt it has been worth it.
  This landmark ruling will allow millions of Americans to rest easy, 
knowing that they will not be driven into debt from medical bills if 
they get sick. Children will no longer be denied possibly life saving 
healthcare because of

[[Page E1180]]

pre-existing conditions, and millions of young Americans will be able 
to stay on their parent's healthcare plans until they are 26.
  The function of government is to make life better for all Americans, 
regardless of socioeconomic background. The Affordable Care Act will 
improve the quality of life for working families, children and seniors. 
It will also strengthen our economy.
  President Obama is to be congratulated for his indispensable 
leadership in achieving the goal of affordable quality healthcare for 
all Americans, a goal we Democrats have been fighting for more than 75 
years.
  It is a fact of life that individuals do not have a choice in 
participating in the health care market. Eventually we will all get 
sick, and need medical attention. This bill requires every American to 
take control of their own coverage, and be responsible for themselves.
  I am proud to have voted in favor of this legislation two years ago, 
and prouder still to have stood on the steps of the Supreme Court today 
to celebrate the success of having the Affordable Care Act upheld. 
Today's ruling is a momentous occasion and a true victory for Americans 
across the nation.

     MARKING 2ND ANNIVERSARY OF PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 20, 2012

  Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, on this two year ``check up'' of the 
Affordable Care Act, I'd like to share with you some real life examples 
of how this important legislation is helping Missourians not only stay 
healthier personally, but improve the health of their small businesses 
as well.
  Last week I took part in a workshop for small businesses, to help arm 
them with solid information on how the Act can help their bottom line. 
Lew Prince is a co-owner of Vintage Vinyl, a St. Louis record store. 
It's a landmark. He's been in business for some 30 years and he's 
always provided health insurance for his employees. BUT, he said for 
the first time EVER, his health care costs went down, went DOWN to the 
tune of 25 percent. With the money he saved, he was actually able to 
give out a few raises, and he's hired a couple of new people.
  The Act has also made a difference for the Wells Family. Sharon Wells 
and her husband Russell have dealt with inordinate expense for his 
medicine for Parkinson's disease for years. Thanks to the donut hole 
coverage provided in the Affordable Care Act, Sharon tells me they have 
more money in the household budget now for groceries and gas, maybe 
even a movie from time to time.
  Even though these are just two small examples, they contribute to the 
overall ripple effect of the profound difference this law is making in 
real people's lives all over the country. In closing, when it comes to 
helping Americans be more healthy, the Affordable Care Act is precisely 
what Americans needed. Let's not do anything to interrupt this healthy 
course of action.

SELECT COMMITTEE NEEDS TO PUT PATIENT PROTECTION AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON 
                               THE TABLE

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, every household in America knows this: The 
easiest money to save is money you haven't yet spent. That seems like 
common sense.

[[Page H5942]]

  We could reduce the deficit by eliminating spending that is to begin 
in the future, spending Americans simply cannot afford. This new select 
committee could easily achieve almost their entire target of reducing 
the Nation's deficit, and, most surprisingly, almost every dollar would 
come from benefits that do not yet exist.
  New mandates in the Affordable Care Act give the Federal Government 
far too much control, and taxpayers far too much responsibility, for 
financing health care in this country. Given our deteriorating debt, 
the simple truth is we simply cannot afford this new spending.
  The select committee will look to strengthen existing entitlement 
programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--but also these 
existing entitlements are on the table. So why shouldn't new 
entitlements created by the Affordable Care Act be as well?
  We have this choice moving forward: We can make the select committee 
negotiations as painful as possible or we can have a logical discussion 
about cutting back on spending that we simply cannot afford.
  The select committee is getting to work, and I encourage both 
parties, all 12 members, to put the Affordable Care Act on the table 
alongside other entitlements in need of reform. Failure to stop will 
simply threaten the very fabric of our Republic.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are here once 
again talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act, a bill that 
passed almost 2 years ago and that, as we all know, was recently upheld 
by the United States Supreme Court. We should be focusing on jobs and 
the economy. The repeal bill we are about to vote on isn't going to go 
anywhere, and we all know that. It won't pass the Senate, and it won't 
be signed into law. We could be doing real things to help Americans and 
the economy right now. Yet here we are, for the 31st time, voting on 
the same thing. So, instead of repeal, let's talk about the benefits to 
Americans as the Affordable Care Act is implemented.
  Because it will result in more people having access to health care, 
the Affordable Care Act will change the lives of millions of people. It 
will prevent more of the heart-wrenching stories like those we all hear 
about with regard to the consequences of a lack of access to health 
care. I know someone whose life would have been changed by the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Bob, in Oregon, lost his job. Because he lost his job, he lost his 
health insurance, so he got on to COBRA. He had that expensive option 
for a while, and at least it gave him coverage, but then his COBRA ran 
out for him, just as it does for so many other people, and he was 
forced to live without health insurance. It was quite a risk that he 
had to take, and it didn't work out so well for him. Like many people 
without insurance, he had medical troubles, but he put off treatment, 
hoping for the best. In the end, though, he ended up in the emergency 
room, which is exactly what the Affordable Care Act is designed to 
prevent. He had surgery, and was then in the hospital for almost a 
month. Because of the sky-high medical bills, he almost lost his home.
  Fortunately, he is doing okay today, but it was a very close call. 
This would not have happened under the Affordable Care Act, and it will 
not happen under the Affordable Care Act. Bob would have had access to 
affordable health care coverage, and he would not have put off 
preventative care, which is covered under the Affordable Care Act. He 
would have seen his doctor at the first sign of a problem, and he would 
not have ended up in the emergency room, which raises health care costs 
for everyone--a cost shift that the Affordable Care Act is designed to 
prevent--and he would not have come so close to losing his home.
  The benefits of the Affordable Care Act are undeniable: Already in my 
home State of Oregon, 43,000 young people have taken advantage of the 
opportunity to stay on their parents' health plans; children can't be 
denied insurance because of preexisting conditions; and 54 million 
Americans now receive free preventative care, and that's just after 2 
years.
  There are more and more benefits that will be implemented over the 
next several years: Insurers will no longer be able to discriminate 
against women; insurance marketplaces, called ``exchanges,'' will be 
created to make sure that everyone has access to affordable health 
insurance options; and starting just next month, women will have access 
to free preventative health care and contraception. All of these will 
be put into place, and as they are, more people will see how the 
Affordable Care Act positively affects their health and their wallets.
  Repealing the Affordable Care Act has no benefits. In fact, doing so 
would take away every single benefit I just mentioned and more. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal would increase 
the deficit--increase the deficit--by $210 billion over the next 10 
years. We can all agree that such an increase is unacceptable and 
fiscally irresponsible. So this will mark the 31st time that the House 
has voted on some form of repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I hope 
it's the last so that we can focus more on the things that really 
matter.

            OPPOSITION TO REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, this is day 2 of the misguided 
Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We have been down 
this road 31 times with the same arguments and the same often 
misleading rhetoric that does not reflect the true benefits of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Those who argue against it are not speaking for my 167,000 uninsured 
constituents who for the first time will receive health insurance 
coverage when the law is fully implemented. They are not speaking for 
the 7,000 young adults who can now stay on their parents' insurance 
plans until they are aged 26, or for the 510 small businesses in my 
district that are receiving tax credits to help maintain or expand 
health care coverage for their employees.
  Colleagues who support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act are also 
disregarding the needs of minority communities in which millions suffer 
from persistent and life-shortening health disparities. In my largely 
Latino district, for example, thousands more of my constituents will 
have access to health care through the expansion of Medicaid, the 
creation of health insurance exchanges, and through the law's expansion 
of community health centers.
  Mr. Speaker, my constituents do not want the Affordable Care Act 
repealed nor do the millions of Americans across our country for which 
the ACA has brought lifesaving benefits. This is most certainly true 
for women, seniors and people with disabilities.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, being female can no longer be 
considered a preexisting condition. Women will no longer have to pay 
higher premiums than men, and prenatal care will finally be covered for 
all women in this country.
  Never again will our sisters, mothers and daughters have to choose 
between a mammogram or putting food on the table because these 
lifesaving preventative health services will no longer require 
copayments.
  As for seniors, last year, as a result of health reform, over 32 
million of them received free preventative health services, and over 5 
million seniors are saving close to $4 billion on Medicare prescription 
drug costs as the doughnut hole closes.
  Because Obama cares, our families and neighbors with disabilities 
will no longer live in fear of reaching lifetime limits on their 
insurance or of being excluded from coverage due to having preexisting 
conditions.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is already working for my 
constituents--for women, for minority communities, for seniors, and for 
people with disabilities. It is time for my Republican colleagues to 
listen to these Americans who do not want to lose their new health 
benefits. The Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act. Let's 
stop wasting time and taxpayers' money and find solutions to the other 
complex issues facing our country today.

                    SUPPORT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Richardson) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the latest 
Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to block 
meaningful health care reform. The Affordable Care Act has been upheld 
by the highest court, the United States Supreme Court, who found that 
this legislation was constitutional.
  I rise today to stress my support of the Affordable Care Act and my 
opposition to the legislation brought before us today.
  This legislation addresses the Affordable Health Care Act, millions 
of uninsured Americans, and it strengthens the Medicare system. It 
relieves all Americans of the growing financial burden and medical 
costs of insurance that many find tough to bear.
  Let me talk a little bit about my district in California. In the 37th 
Congressional District, the benefits of this bill are already 
undisputable. There are now 23,000 children and 90,000 adults who have 
health care insurance that covers preventive services with no copays, 
co-insurance, or deductible. There will be 501 small businesses that 
will receive tax credits that will help them maintain or expand their 
health care coverage for their employees. Health care providers in my 
district have received $3.4 million in affordable care grants since 
2010 to support community health centers, to develop innovative and 
cost-saving health care delivery systems, and to train new health care 
professionals. These statistics are not unique to my district. There 
are similar success stories emerging all over the country.
  Let me speak a little bit about some of those general things that are 
happening. If you're a senior, based upon the Affordable Care Act now, 
you are receiving a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs when you 
are in Medicare and you experience the doughnut hole coverage gap. You 
have free key preventive services such as mammograms, colonoscopies, 
and a free annual well-visit with your physician. If you're a woman, 
you now have free coverage of lifesaving preventive services such as 
mammograms. Beginning in August, free coverage will also include 
additional comprehensive women-preventive services, including breast 
feeding support, contraception, and domestic violence screening.
  If you're a parent and you have a child who is under the age of 19, 
they can't be denied coverage by an insurance company because of a 
preexisting condition. If you're an adult, you can now join or stay on 
your parents' health plan until you're 26 years old. Those are for our 
young adults. If you're a small business owner, you will be one of the 
millions who will be eligible as a small business owner to receive tax 
credits if you choose to offer coverage to your employees.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act was a long-overdue bill that 
corrects deep injustices and access to health care. The Affordable Care 
Act should be an act that is respected and upheld by this House. It has 
gone through the proper channels of legislation and now has been 
validated by the United States Supreme Court.
  Mr. Speaker, all Americans--young, old, rich, and poor--have an 
inalienable right to health care and to be able to prosper. To be able 
to prosper, you need to be healthy.
  I ask my colleagues to support the Affordable Care Act and to join me 
in fierce opposition to repealing the advances in health care that we 
already won. When we look forward, we must focus on implementing the 
affordable health care bill and focus on getting Americans back to 
work.

 THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT: KEEPING SENIORS HEALTHY AND REDUCING HEALTH 
                               CARE COSTS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) is 
recognized for 38 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I don't plan to use the entire time, but I 
come to the floor this evening basically to talk about the Affordable 
Care Act. Some call it the health care reform.
  This Friday will be the second anniversary of the President's signing 
of the Affordable Care Act, or health care reform, and I'd like to talk 
a little bit about how it's helping so many people with patient 
protections and added benefits, whether you're talking about seniors or 
young people or women or just the general public.
  The main thing that is heralded, if you will, by the Affordable Care 
Act is the opportunity over the next few years to expand health 
insurance to so many Americans who do not have health insurance now. We 
estimate there are variously between 40, maybe 45 million Americans 
that simply have no health insurance; and what that means is they 
either don't go to a doctor or they don't get any kind of health care 
unless they get very sick and end up going to the emergency room. The 
consequences of that is that they take no preventative care. They end 
up in the emergency room. Oftentimes, they can't afford to pay the cost 
of the emergency room, and that cost simply gets passed on to the 
hospital or, ultimately, to everyone else who is paying for health 
insurance.
  So basically, what the Affordable Care Act does over the next few 
years is try to expand insurance coverage to something like 98, 99 
percent of all Americans, taking up those 45 million people and, for 
the most part, making sure that they have health insurance. It does 
that in two basic ways:
  First of all, it expands Medicaid, which is the health insurance 
program for people below a certain income. About 15 million Americans 
who have no health insurance now would be eligible for Medicaid under 
the Affordable Care Act over the next few years when it kicks in.
  In addition to that, for the rest of the Americans who have no health 
insurance, most of them are people that either don't get it on their 
job, they're not eligible, or they're not offered health insurance by 
their employer, or they may be individuals who are employed on their 
own or at home or not employed in some capacity. They have a very hard 
time buying a health insurance policy on what we call the individual 
market. So what the Affordable Care Act does, it sets up exchanges in 
every State, or throughout the country, where you can get a very good 
package for a reasonable price, a very low-cost price, and, at the same 
time, it provides a subsidy through tax credits to many Americans, 
depending upon their income.
  We estimate for a family of four making up to $70,000 or $80,000 a 
year would be eligible for some sort of subsidy or tax credit that 
would make their health insurance policy more affordable. So 
essentially, what we do is, between expansion of Medicaid and the 
subsidies, if you will, and the low-cost insurances offered now on 
these exchanges around the country, most people would end up with 
health insurance.
  Now, what I wanted to talk about today are some of the benefits, if 
you will, that have already kicked in for various groups of people, 
particularly seniors. I wanted to start with seniors because many 
seniors, as you know, because they're on a fixed income, have a hard 
time making ends meet. Oftentimes, they can't afford their rent, they 
can't afford food, and for them to take extra money out of pocket to 
pay for health care costs is oftentimes very difficult, and they have 
to make choices between heat or food as opposed to health care.
  One of the things that I really want to stress today, because I 
listened in the last few nights, because of the anniversary of the 
Affordable Care Act coming up on Friday, I've heard some of my 
colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle actually suggest that 
somehow the Affordable Care Act was going to negatively impact 
Medicare. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the 
Affordable Care Act expands benefits for seniors under Medicare in many 
significant ways.
  But it's particularly interesting that I hear that from the other 
side of the aisle, from the Republican side of the aisle this week 
because, on Tuesday, the Republicans unveiled their budget for the next 
fiscal year.

                              {time}  2050

  Once again as they did last year in last year's budget, the 
Republican budget this year essentially gets rid of Medicare, or what I 
would say ends traditional Medicare. So it's kind of strange to hear 
the Republicans talk about Medicare and the Affordable Care Act since 
the Affordable Care Act actually expands benefits for seniors under 
Medicare, whereas they unveiled their budget this week that actually 
abolishes, for all practical purposes, Medicare as we know it.
  What the Republican budget does, once again, is say to seniors, Well, 
we're going to give you a voucher. We're going to give you a certain 
amount of money through a voucher, if you will, and you can take that 
and go out and buy private insurance instead of getting the guaranteed 
benefit under Medicare that seniors now have.
  The problem with a voucher is that it's a fixed amount of money, and 
it's not all clear that seniors can buy health insurance with a 
voucher. But even if they could, because it's a fixed amount of money 
and it doesn't increase significantly over the years, what you'll find 
with that voucher is that more and more seniors would have to pay out 
of pocket either to purchase the insurance because the voucher is not 
enough or because they probably can't get a decent package equivalent 
to the Medicare guarantee, and therefore would have to pay out of 
pocket for certain costs that are not covered by the health care plan 
that they purchased with the voucher.
  So it's sort of ironic to hear the Republicans talk about the 
Affordable Care Act and suggest that the Affordable Care Act should be 
repealed because of its impact on Medicare when in fact they're doing 
their best under the budget to basically end Medicare as we know it.
  Let me talk a little bit about some of the benefits.
  I want to talk about how the Affordable Care Act helps seniors, and 
then a little bit about how it helps women, and then a little bit about 
how it helps young people.
  Of course, it helps everybody by simply expanding health care 
coverage for those who don't have health insurance.
  But the benefits, in particular, I want to talk about and start with 
seniors.
  I mentioned before that no group has been hit harder by soaring 
health care costs than seniors. With the economy struggling over the 
last several years, seniors have suffered even more as they've watched 
many of their pensions and investments dwindle, making

[[Page H1491]]

the cost of addressing their health care needs even more challenging.
  Now, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, some of the financial 
burdens plaguing seniors trying to manage their health care needs have 
been alleviated.
  For example, all Medicare beneficiaries now have access to 
preventative care and services without any copay, coinsurance, or 
deductible. Many times you will find that seniors won't even access 
health care because of the copay, which is about 20 percent in most 
cases.
  So now services like annual wellness visits, cholesterol and other 
cardiovascular screenings, mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, 
prostate cancer screenings are completely free of charge to seniors. No 
copay. The fact of the matter is that the Affordable Care Act expands 
benefits for seniors, makes it so seniors pay less.
  More than 32.5 million seniors nationwide have received one or more 
free preventative services, and 2.3 million seniors have already 
received a free annual wellness visit to their doctor, which again is a 
critical step in preventing a more serious illness because if the 
senior citizen goes for the annual checkup or has some of these 
preventative services free of charge, then that avoids them having to 
get sicker, ending up in a nursing home or ending up in a hospital.
  The most important thing, though, in terms of expansion of benefits 
under the Affordable Care Act for seniors is the closing of the 
Medicare part D doughnut hole.
  Seniors before the Affordable Care Act would run out of their part D 
benefits on the average by September of the year. In other words, if 
they spent more than $2,500 approximately on drugs, they wouldn't get 
any help under Medicare part D until they got to a higher catastrophic 
level of $5,000. So that was the doughnut hole, that gap when they 
weren't getting any money to help pay for their prescription drugs.
  What the Affordable Care Act does is it closes the Medicare part D 
doughnut hole and provides a 50 percent discount on brand name drugs. 
3.6 million seniors have already received the discount, saving a total 
of $2.1 billion, with each senior saving an average of $604.
  Now, by 2020 that doughnut hole is closed completely. Now it's a 50 
percent discount, but gradually that will close by 2020 when all their 
drugs are covered and the doughnut hole ceases to exist.
  I also want to stress that the Affordable Care Act has cracked down 
on fraud in Medicare. In fiscal year 2011, a joint anti-Medicare fraud 
task force of the Health and Human Services Department, Department of 
Justice, recovered more than $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare 
payments on behalf of taxpayers.
  A lot of times, my senior citizens will say to me well, there's a lot 
of fraud in Medicare. There is. But the Affordable Care Act has 
significantly cracked down on a lot of that fraud, $4.1 billion in 
fiscal year 2011.
  Now, I mention this again by way of contrast. Here we are in the 
Affordable Care Act expanding benefits, making it so seniors don't have 
to pay more, and what are the Republicans doing with their budget? They 
have a budget that basically says we'll give you a voucher. You go out 
and buy your health insurance. If you can't afford it, you have to pay 
the difference. The basic guarantee of Medicare and a good benefit 
package simply won't be there, and seniors will just end up paying more 
out of pocket.
  Now, I wanted to talk a little bit about how the Affordable Care Act 
levels the field for women's health care because we know that 
traditionally in health care there has been a huge gender gap.
  A report issued this week from the National Women's Law Center shows 
that more than 90 percent of the best selling health plans still charge 
women more than men for the same coverage just because women use more 
health services. The health care law, the Affordable Care Act, will 
prohibit this discriminatory practice, which we call gender rating, 
beginning in 2014. So that when the Affordable Care Act fully kicks in, 
this gender gap will simply disappear.

  Now, you might say to yourself, well, how is that possible? It's 
mainly because insurers have considered millions of women as having 
what we call preexisting conditions. In other words, they were denied 
coverage or they were charged more for having had breast cancers, 
Cesarean-section childbirth, having even been pregnant. Some policies 
would charge women more because they were pregnant or consider that a 
preexisting condition. Or for being victims of domestic abuse, for 
example.
  So denying women insurance on these grounds is unconscionable, and 
thanks to the Affordable Care Act, beginning in 2014, women will no 
longer be denied coverage by any insurers based on these preexisting 
conditions, and they can't be charged more because of the preexisting 
conditions.
  Now, we've seen again by contrast, what have the Republicans been 
doing? They say repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would let these 
preexisting conditions and this gender gap continue. But beyond that, 
over the last year or so, we've seen the Republicans essentially 
declare war on women, and I just want to give you an example.
  One of the ones that has received the most attention lately are these 
attempts by the Republicans to block access to contraception. I don't 
know how far they're going to go in terms of denying women coverage, 
but that's one of the things that we've seen in the headlines for the 
last few months or so.
  Let me give you some other examples under the Affordable Care Act. 
Insurance companies are now prohibited from requiring women to obtain a 
pre-authorization or referral for access to OB GYN care. Health care 
reform also requires insurance plans to cover important preventative 
services, including critical immunizations, numerous health screenings, 
and counseling services, with no cash cost-sharing by women.
  Women in new private plans under the Affordable Care Act, they 
provide free coverage of important lifesaving preventative services.
  But the other thing that would often happen is that many health 
insurance plans have what they call lifetime dollar limits on health 
benefits so that if a woman--this would be true for anyone if they have 
that lifetime dollar limit in it--but oftentimes it was applied to 
women in particular; that if you spent a certain amount of money on 
your health care over your lifetime, that was it. You didn't get any 
more coverage under your plan. So that is also prohibited under the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Now, I just mentioned those few things that apply to women because 
there really continues to exist a gender gap but that will be closed 
and eliminated under the Affordable Care Act when it completely kicks 
in.
  Now, the last group I wanted to mention just because I always felt 
that many times in Congress we don't pay a lot of attention to kids, 
and I felt that it's very important for us to recognize the fact that 
policies and the practices and the laws don't necessarily help 
children, and children are very vulnerable. It's like, the seniors are 
vulnerable, the children are vulnerable.
  One of the things that's significant about the Affordable Care Act, 
it really makes a difference for children in terms of keeping them 
healthy and also keeping them insured.

                              {time}  2100

  And a lot of times Americans have to make choices with regard to 
their kids about whether they can afford health care services because 
of the prohibitive cost of insuring children.
  Under the old system, before the Affordable Care Act, sick children 
were often denied health coverage if their parents were forced to 
change insurance because they either switched or lost their jobs. 
Insurance companies declined or dropped coverage for children when 
young adults got sick or had an accident. That's no longer the case. 
Under the Affordable Care Act, basically there is a prohibition on 
insurers denying coverage of children under age 19 for having a 
preexisting children.
  Up to 17 million children with preexisting conditions are now 
protected from that type of discrimination. Currently, there are 7.3 
million American children without any health insurance. Beginning in 
2014, the law will provide access to quality coverage. That's 
accomplished again by expanding Medicaid coverage and also by providing 
affordable insurance on these exchanges with a tax credit or some kind 
of help

[[Page H1492]]

from the Federal Government to pay for the insurance.
  The other thing I wanted to point out, though--and this is really 
significant because, again, it has kicked in and I've had many of my 
constituents come up to me and mention it--is that the Affordable Care 
Act requires health plans to allow parents to keep children under age 
26 without job-based coverage on their family's coverage and give 
millions of parents and young adults the peace of mind that they can 
start their lives and careers without being crippled by health care 
expenses.
  What happens is that because of the economy and the difficulties 
we've had with the economy over the last few years, a lot of kids or 
young adults, when they graduate high school, when they graduate 
college, are not able to find a job, or while they are in college they 
can't afford health insurance on their own because they have to go out 
and buy it on the individual market. What the Affordable Care Act says 
is you can be kept on your parents' policy and the insurance company 
has to provide that option up to the age of 26. That's very 
significant. Millions of young people that did not have coverage are 
now covered by that under their parents' policy.
  I just wanted to take a couple more minutes. I wanted to give some 
examples of the numbers of people in my district, the Sixth 
Congressional District in New Jersey, that have been impacted in a 
positive way by the Affordable Care Act.
  These statistics come from my committee that I serve on, the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce. And just to give you some idea, in my 
district, in the Sixth District of New Jersey:
  6,800 young adults in the district now have health insurance that 
didn't have it before;
  9,100 seniors in the district received prescription drug discounts 
worth $6.9 million, an average discount of $760 per senior. This is for 
their prescription drug coverage;
  There were 63,000 seniors in the Sixth District in New Jersey that 
received Medicare preventive services without paying any copays, 
coinsurance, or deductibles;
  31,000 children and 130,000 adults now have health insurance that 
covers preventive services without paying any copays, coinsurance, or 
deductibles;
  There are 620 small businesses in the Sixth District that received 
tax credits to help maintain or expand health insurance coverage for 
their employees;
  There have been $1.8 million in public health grants that have been 
given to community health centers, hospitals, doctors, and other health 
care providers to improve the community's health. Community health 
centers have really expanded in the district because of the Affordable 
Care Act; and
  There are 8,000 to 35,000 children with preexisting health conditions 
who can no longer be denied coverage by health insurers.
  I can give you more statistics, but I just want to point out that 
these benefits under the Affordable Care Act are impacting constituents 
in every district in the country, not just mine. Not only the thousands 
of people in my district, but all over the country, millions of people.
  I just wanted to talk a little bit about the cost issue, because I 
always hear the Republicans say, Oh, your costs are going to go up 
because of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, costs for health insurance 
now without the Affordable Care Act have gone up, but the Affordable 
Care Act actually is reducing costs for health insurance. Whatever cost 
increases that are being exhibited now are because the Affordable Care 
Act hasn't gone into effect completely. It kicks in gradually over the 
next few years.
  I also hear some of my Republican colleagues say, Oh, your health 
insurance went up. That's because it hasn't kicked in yet. Once it 
kicks in, there are a lot of positive impacts on costs that will make a 
difference.
  Let me just talk about some of the statistics in terms of costs that 
I think are significant.
  Since enactment of the health care law, the reform, the ACA, premiums 
are generally lower or stable. Average premiums for Medicare Advantage 
enrollees are 7 percent lower in 2012 than they were in 2011. Since the 
health care law was enacted, these premiums have fallen by 16 percent. 
Average premiums for Medicare part D, the prescription drug program, in 
2012, have seen no increase from the 2011 level. The Medicare part B 
deductible has fallen by $22 to $144 in 2012, the first time in 
Medicare history that the deductible has actually fallen. For most 
Medicare part B enrollees, the standard part B premium in 2012 is quite 
stable. It's 3.6 percent higher than the premium they paid in 2011, 
matching the 3.6 percent COLA increase seniors are receiving in their 
Social Security checks.
  The growth in private plan premiums has also slowed. In September 
2011, Mercer, an independent benefits consulting firm, released a 
survey of employers showing that health insurance premium increases 
will average 5.4 percent in 2012, the smallest increase measured since 
1997. Despite Republican claims, the health care law has played 
essentially no role in recent private plan premium increases. In fact, 
the premium increases have taken effect only because the ACA has not 
fully kicked in at this point.
  There are two provisions that I wanted to mention that deal with cost 
and that address cost in the Affordable Care Act that I think are 
significant and that put downward pressure on premiums.
  One is the rate review, and that is, under the health care law, there 
is a new transparency and accountability for insurers, with insurers 
being required to publicly justify on the Internet any premium 
increases they are seeking that are over 10 percent. And the Department 
of Health and Human Services has rate review authority to publicly deem 
these increases to be unreasonable, and they've done that in a number 
of States. The health care law also provides $250 million in health 
care insurance rate review grants to the States to make them enforce 
and keep premiums down.
  Finally, under the health care law, insurers must spend at least 80 
percent of premiums on medical care and quality improvement rather than 
CEO pay, profits, and administrative costs. If insurers don't meet 
these standards, they have to pay rebates to their consumers starting 
this summer. These are significant ways of cutting back on costs.
  What do we see from the other side of the aisle? Again, repeal the 
Affordable Care Act. If the Affordable Care Act were repealed, all the 
things that I talked about would disappear. Costs would climb. More and 
more people would have no insurance. All the benefits for seniors--the 
fact that you can have your children on the policy until 26, the gender 
gap for women, all these things, all the benefits would disappear and 
only the bad impacts from insurance companies being able to do whatever 
they want would remain.
  The Republicans talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act. They 
don't say what they would substitute for it. What we do know--and I'm 
going to close with this, Mr. Speaker--this week we heard from the 
Republicans in terms of what they want to do with their budget. Again, 
what does their budget do? It essentially privatizes Medicare. It makes 
it into a voucher program, causing seniors to spend more money out of 
pocket for the type of guaranteed benefits they receive now under 
Medicare. It even goes and impacts Medicaid.
  A lot of people are not aware of the fact that Medicaid, which most 
people see as a program for poor people, actually pays most of the 
costs for nursing home care in this country. What happens is that if 
you have to go to a nursing home, you have to spend all your assets 
essentially--with few exceptions--on paying for that nursing home care; 
and then after you have no assets left, the Medicaid kicks in and pays 
for your nursing home care.
  What do the Republicans do in their budget? They basically slash 
Medicaid. They block-grant it to the States. They slash it from 20 
percent to 30 percent based on different accounts. That's a 20 percent 
to 30 percent slash, and that money goes back to the States because the 
States have to match Medicaid. They also abolish the expansion of 
Medicaid, that I mentioned before, under the Affordable Care Act 
because they assume under the budget that the Affordable Care Act is 
going to be repealed.
  So not only is there a negative impact on Medicare because it becomes 
a voucher and essentially traditional Medicare disappears and seniors 
pay

[[Page H1493]]

more out of pocket, but with regard to Medicaid, which pays for nursing 
home care, the States are going to get so much less money that the 
quality of nursing home care will seriously diminish.

                              {time}  2110

  I remember back in the seventies when you would go to many nursing 
homes, and they were terrible places. Because we upgraded them and we 
provided money to the States to pay for Medicaid, which they matched, 
the quality of nursing homes improved significantly. Well, what 
happened--and I'm not just telling this. The nursing home industry has 
said this--with these types of cuts that are being proposed in the 
Republican budget, a lot of nursing homes will close, and their quality 
of care will diminish. They won't have as many nurses on staff. They 
won't be able to do a lot of the things they do now to make people's 
lives in nursing homes more comfortable.
  And the budget assumes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which 
means that the expansion of Medicaid, the subsidy to pay for health 
insurance, all the things that I have talked about before would simply 
disappear.
  So I know I make a stark contrast between what the Republicans are 
proposing and what we're doing with the Affordable Care Act and trying, 
on the Democratic side, to shore up and expand Medicare benefits. But 
the fact of the matter is that it is a stark contrast, a very stark 
contrast in terms of a world view of what we are going to do in terms 
of health insurance coverage and what we're going to do to protect 
seniors in Medicare. And I think it's very important for my colleagues 
to understand these differences as we proceed over the next few weeks.
  So I am very proud of the fact that on Friday, we will be celebrating 
the second anniversary of President Obama signing the Affordable Care 
Act. And I am also proud of the fact that, as a Democrat, we are going 
to oppose the Republican budget. When the Republican budget was 
proposed last year, it passed the House, but it didn't pass the Senate; 
and we heard nothing more about it.
  And that's exactly what we plan on doing this year because we can't 
allow Medicare to be destroyed. We can't allow the Medicare guarantee 
to disappear. We can't allow Medicare to basically wither on the vine, 
as former Speaker Gingrich said, as it's vouchered and as it's 
privatized, as the Republicans suggest in their budget.
  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2013

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that many of our 
colleagues across the aisle are hoping and betting that the Affordable 
Care Act will fail.
  But every day it becomes clearer that they are losing that bet and 
their hope for failure is not shared by the American people, 105 
million of whom already have received coverage for one or more free 
preventive health care services like screenings for breast cancer and 
diabetes.
  In my state of Texas, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 
5,198,00 individuals with private insurance who have received coverage 
for one or more free preventive services due to the Affordable Care 
Act.
  Children have received free vision and hearing screenings and 
recommended immunizations.
  Adults have received free immunizations and cancer screenings such as 
colonoscopies for cancer, cholesterol and high blood pressure 
screening; and HIV.
  Women have received preventive services such as recommended 
mammograms and Pap smears; screenings for gestational diabetes; and 
domestic violence counseling.
  Our Republican friends like to tell themselves that Obamacare is an 
unmitigated disaster. But to millions of Americans living in the real 
world, Obamacare is an unqualified success.


                       TEXAS--ACA SUCCESS STORIES

  Take Mark and Lucy for example,
  After comparing plans, Mark Sullivan, a new business owner, settled 
on a bronze option and added dental insurance. He will receive an $82 
per month subsidy, which will halve the monthly premium he will pay 
down to $78.
  Lucy is another Texan who is thankful for the Affordable Care Act, 
which is enabling her to save $2,300 a year on her premium and $4,000 
on her deductible.
  Lucy writes: ``I signed up at Healthcare.gov and I'm going to save 
$2,300 a year on my premium alone--and more, because my deductible will 
drop from $7,500 a year to $3,000 a year. It's still Blue Cross 
insurance, and I don't have to change doctors, either. I had a choice 
of over 30 plans and several different companies.''
  Mr. Speaker, my constituents in the i8th Congressional District of 
Texas favor the Affordable Care Act because they understand the 
insecurity and feeling of helplessness of being uninsured or 
underinsured. My home state of Texas has the highest percentage of 
uninsured, 27.6 percent in the nation, 4 percent more than Louisiana, 
the next state on the list.
  Mr. Speaker, health care coverage not only must be available and 
affordable but also adequate for consumers to have the health security 
and financial protection they need and deserve. The Affordable Care Act 
satisfies these criteria.
  Of course we should not be surprised by the House Republicans. After 
all, it is was the House Republicans who shut down the federal 
government for 16 days and cost the economy $24 billion while refusing 
to consider any legislation that would create jobs or address the real 
needs of the American people.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to reflect with my 
colleagues and say that we celebrate today the 1-year anniversary of 
the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and to reflect how much 
happened to improve health care in America since the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  We have reason to celebrate. If you are a senior in the Medicare 
Program, and you now know that you can see your primary care doctor 
every year for an annual wellness exam, and that wellness exam will now 
be covered under Medicare, and you will have an opportunity to meet 
with your doctor and take charge of your own health, you have a reason 
to celebrate passage of the Affordable Care Act.
  If you are a senior who happens to fall within the coverage gap under 
the prescription drug benefits in Medicare, the so-called doughnut 
hole, and you have been forced at times to leave prescriptions on the 
counter of a drugstore because you could not afford to pay the cost of 
the prescription, and you now know that there is coverage in Medicare 
if you fall within that gap--for last year, 3.2 million seniors who 
fell within the gap received a $250 check. This year, the seniors who 
fall within this coverage gap will receive a 50-percent discount on 
their brandname drugs. Next year, their benefit will be worth as much 
as $2,400 and, by 2020, we will close the gap entirely, all as a result 
of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. So you have reason to 
celebrate that Congress finally got the job done.
  If you are an American family, like many, and you celebrate your 
child's graduation from college, only to find that your child could no 
longer be covered under your health insurance policy because of the age 
restriction, and now you learn that Congress has changed that age to 
26, so you can keep your youngster under your family insurance program, 
and that child now has health insurance, and you are one of 1.2 million 
people who benefit from this provision that was in the Affordable Care 
Act, you have reason to celebrate the passage of the Affordable Care 
Act.
  If you are a small business owner who can now afford to cover your 
employees because of the small business tax credit that was included in 
the Affordable Care Act--4 million eligible institutions will be 
eligible for that tax credit, and soon you will be able to get 
competitive rates. Small businesses today pay 20 percent more for the 
same coverage large companies have. Congress took action last year to 
eliminate that disparity. If you are one of those small business owners 
now benefiting from that tax credit or who will benefit from more 
competitive rates and better choice, you have reason to celebrate the 
passage of the Affordable Care Act.
  If you happen to be a consumer of health insurance, as almost all of 
us are, and you want value for your premium dollar, you now know that 
with passage of the Affordable Care Act, the lion's share of your 
health premiums must go for health benefits, reining in the excessive 
administrative costs of private insurance companies, and you know now 
that Congress has taken action to prevent the abusive practices of 
private insurance companies, you have reason to celebrate the passage 
of the Affordable Care Act.
  If you happen to be the woman in Maryland, who was hiking in the 
mountains of West Virginia and fell off a cliff, was unconscious, and 
was flown to the closest emergency room to receive care and was denied 
coverage because she did not call ahead for preauthorization, you have 
a reason to celebrate the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.
  Yes, insurance companies have denied coverage for emergency care 
because of requirements for preauthorization or have denied coverage 
because the ultimate diagnosis did not meet their standard for 
reimbursement, even though your symptoms indicated you should seek 
emergency care. I started working on that issue in 1995, known as the 
prudent layperson's standards for requiring insurance companies to 
reimburse their policyholders for visits to emergency rooms, where 
their symptoms indicated they should go to the emergency room.
  In 1997, Medicare and Medicaid were changed in order to provide for 
the prudent layperson's standard for reimbursement. Now all insurance 
companies must comply with that standard because of the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  If you are a parent who has a child who has asthma or you have been 
told that the insurance company won't provide full coverage because of 
your child's preexisting condition, and now you can get full coverage 
for your child, you too have a reason to celebrate the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  If you are an adult and have been told you cannot get insurance 
because of a preexisting condition, such as high blood pressure, or you 
happen to be like a couple from Montgomery County, MD, who had to get 
two separate insurance policies because of preexisting conditions, 
paying two separate premiums and two separate deductibles, and now you 
know you can get one insurance plan that will cover your family, you 
have a reason to celebrate, because that too was corrected by the 
Affordable Care Act that was passed by Congress 1 year ago.
  If you happen to be a taxpayer who is concerned about the fiscal 
soundness of Medicare or the budget deficit, you too have a reason to 
celebrate enactment of the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable 
Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare system by 12 years, 
putting it on a safer basis, making it less vulnerable for our budget.
  The enactment of the Affordable Care Act reduced the Federal budget 
deficit by over $100 billion during the first 10 years, and over $1.5 
trillion during the first 20 years. This is because, quite frankly, 
this bill manages illness much more cost effectively. It uses health 
information technology more effectively and it invests in wellness, and 
it brings down the cost. That is not what this

[[Page S1711]]

Senator is saying has been established; it is what the CBO has told us 
will bring in savings on our budget deficit. Taxpayers have a reason to 
celebrate the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.

  There is one other reason to celebrate the year's anniversary of the 
enactment of this legislation. Let me give one more example. A couple 
of weeks ago I was at the Greater Baden Health Center located about 7 
or 8 miles from where we are today. They are doing something about the 
infant mortality rate in our community. We have too high of an infant 
mortality rate because of low birth weight babies. Some do not survive 
and become part of our infant mortality numbers in America where we are 
much higher than we should be. Others survive and have complications 
that need to be addressed by our health care system, making it 
challenging for the infant and expensive for our society.
  At the Greater Baden Health Center, they are doing something about 
that situation. They are expanding their qualified health center to 
include prenatal care so pregnant women can get the type of attention 
they need to have healthy babies. That money comes from the Affordable 
Care Act because of the expansion of our qualified health centers.
  We all celebrate what we are able to accomplish. It will keep our 
children healthier and save us money and have less use of the emergency 
rooms by expanding care at our qualified centers.
  Madam President, if you are concerned about health disparities in 
America--and you have reason to be--minorities are two times more 
likely to suffer from diabetes and 33 percent more likely to die from 
heart disease. In the African-American community, the infant mortality 
rate is 2.3 times higher than the White community. When we look at the 
number of people who have access to health care and health insurance, 
the minority population represents one-third. Yet they are one-half of 
the people who do not have health insurance.
  I think we all agree that we need to do something about that 
situation. That is not right in our sense of fairness. But let me give 
one more reason it will save us money.
  A study done at Johns Hopkins University and the University of 
Maryland points out that we can save $260 billion in excess direct 
medical care costs if we can deal with the minority health disparities. 
We had done something about that in the Affordable Care Act. An 
amendment that I was proud to offer established the Institute for 
Minority Health and Health Disparities within the National Institutes 
of Health. We have developed minority health and disparity offices in 
each of our agencies that deal with health care to do something about 
health disparities in America. We can all celebrate that we are able to 
move that forward in the Affordable Care Act.
  We should all take pride that America at long last, after decades of 
unsuccessful attempts, has acted. Health care is a right, not a 
privilege. As our dear friend, the late Senator Kennedy, said: We no 
longer have a sick care system. We have taken action to include all 
under health care in America.
  I understand the Republicans in the House want to repeal each and 
every one of these improvements and accomplishments. They offer no hope 
of taking up these issues in a serious manner during this Congress. 
Speaking on behalf of our seniors, speaking on behalf of our small 
business owners, speaking on behalf of the consumers of health 
insurance in America, speaking on behalf of what is right, as far as 
covering and making sure everyone has access to affordable care, we do 
not want to see that happen. We do not want to move backwards. We have 
reason to celebrate the accomplishments of moving forward with health 
care. We want to move forward, not back, and continue to build on an 
American health care system that provides affordable quality care to 
all Americans.
  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, opponents of the Affordable Care Act in 
Congress have spent the past few weeks reveling in the problems of the 
Federal exchange Web site, healthcare.gov.
  In my State of Kentucky, where we have created our own exchange, we 
have had tremendous success. As of last week, nearly 415,000 people had 
explored the Web site and assessed their options. More than 42,000 are 
now enrolled in health plans, many of them for the first time; and 843 
small businesses have begun applying for coverage for their employees, 
with 309 of them already able to offer coverage to their workers.
  We are 6 weeks into a 6-month open enrollment period, and while the 
failures of the Federal health care Web site are frustrating, they are 
far from fatal. The true danger to the more than 42,000 Kentuckians who 
have gained coverage under the law--and the hundreds of thousands more 
who will--is what opponents of the law are proposing in its place: a 
return to the broken system that failed tens of millions of Americans 
each year.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues and the American people to 
keep a healthy perspective. We did not enact the Affordable Care Act to 
launch a Web site. We did it to ensure that every American has access 
to affordable, quality care, and we should all work together to 
accomplish that goal.

[Pages S2320-S2321]
                    AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ANNIVERSARY

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, three years ago tomorrow, President Obama 
signed into law the Affordable Care Act. This landmark law will extend 
health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans when the 
reforms are fully implemented next year. Getting to this point has been 
an arduous process. But in the end, this achievement proved that real 
reform is possible, and that the voices of so many Americans who over 
the years have called on their leaders to act have finally been heard.
  Since its passage, Americans have seen the immediate benefits of the 
Affordable Care Act and 3 years later, those improvements continue. 
Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions are continuing to 
receive help when trapped within the coverage gap known as the doughnut 
hole. The Affordable Care Act completely closes the coverage gap by 
2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to afford 
prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7,000 Vermonters 
received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their prescription 
drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year alone, nearly 6,400 
Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their 
covered brand-name prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of 
$765 per person. Since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, 
more than 5,000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance 
coverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their 
parents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are 
seeing in Vermont go on and on: in 2011 and 2012, 71 million Americans 
and 151,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and 
received preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay, 
including more than 80,000 Medicare beneficiaries. These are just a few 
of the dozens of consumer protections included in the law that are 
benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day, and in many ways.
  The law goes into full swing next year as even more consumer 
protections are implemented and millions more Americans gain access to 
health insurance coverage. Beginning in January, insurance companies 
will no longer be allowed to deny coverage to individuals with 
preexisting health conditions or to charge higher premiums based on 
health status or gender. Unfortunately, estimates show that 44,000 
Vermonters currently do not have health insurance, but with the 
Medicaid expansion contained in the Affordable Care Act, 84 percent of 
these Vermonters will qualify for Medicaid or a premium tax credit. 
Also important to Vermonters, to assist Vermont with our State's work 
on implementing Vermont's State-based health insurance exchange--or 
marketplace--Vermont has received more than $125,000,000 in grants for 
research and for information technology development, as well as almost 
$3,480,000 for maternal health programs. These tangible initiatives 
help at-risk families gain the support they need to improve their 
children's health and ability to learn, and they help prevent child 
abuse.
  I was proud as well to work with Senator Grassley and others to 
include strong anti-fraud provisions in the law that already have 
helped prevent and detect fraudulent activities that in the past have 
cost American taxpayers multiple millions of dollars each year. Thanks 
in part to these efforts, $4.2 billion was returned to taxpayers last 
year alone.
  In only 3 years, Vermonters across our State have seen the many 
benefits of health care reform unfold in their lives. I see and hear 
about these improvements and pocketbook savings in visits to every 
corner of our State. At home in Middlesex and throughout Vermont, 
whether I am in the grocery store, at the gas pump, or at church, I am 
constantly reminded of how important access to quality affordable 
health care is to individuals and families. I applaud Vermont's efforts 
to expand the Affordable Care Act's reach even further to help every 
resident secure health insurance. I am proud that the Affordable Care 
Act offers Vermont the foundation it needs to reach this goal, and I 
look forward to working to see that it is met.
  Regrettably, opponents of the Affordable Care Act continue to 
misleadingly attack the law in an attempt to undermine its 
implementation. The moment President Obama signed this bill into law, 
opponents sought to continue their political battle by challenging the 
landmark legislation in the courts. With the legal challenges now 
nearly resolved, we are now seeing amendments filed to every bill we 
consider on the floor, aimed at repealing or gutting the Affordable 
Care Act. In fact, on the budget resolution we are considering today, 
dozens of amendments have been filed in an effort to block the 
Affordable Care Act's implementation, to undermine its success in 
making lives better across the land, or to repeal the law completely. 
This is unfortunate, it is shortsighted, and it is cynical. Even more 
shameful is the budget resolution considered and passed by the House 
this week. The House-passed budget would make drastic changes to the 
Medicaid Program causing 14 to 20 million Americans to lose health 
coverage; it would replace Medicare with a voucher scheme costing 
seniors at least $6000 more per year; and would completely repeal all 
the consumer protections included in the Affordable Care Act.
  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but in the true interests of 
the

[[Page S2321]]

people we represent we should be working together to ensure its 
success. We can make improvements where necessary, but we must allow 
full implementation to continue. Already the Affordable Care Act has 
changed so many lives for the better, and we must not turn our backs on 
the millions more who will have access to health care next year because 
of these reforms.
  The Affordable Care Act is a tremendous achievement that will improve 
the lives of Americans for generations to come. This anniversary is a 
time to renew our commitment to completing this important work on 
behalf of the American people, who are counting on us to do the right 
thing. With each year that we move forward to implement the features of 
this landmark health care reform law, the stories of families not being 
able to gain access to affordable coverage are becoming fewer and fewer 
and are being replaced by stories of the success of these reforms, one 
family at a time, all across Vermont and all across America. I look 
forward to continuing to work with Vermont and with the administration 
as the law moves forward in its fourth year.

             MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act was passed now 
almost 3 years ago, and the Affordable Care Act was going to lower 
costs. And why wouldn't you like it? You get free stuff.
  Well, how do you pay for that free stuff?
  It turns out five new taxes were started on January of this year. 
What are they, and who do they affect?
  Well, there's a big tax on medical devices. Now everyone talks about 
wanting to encourage American investment, encourage American 
manufacturing. But with this tax we're encouraging manufacturers to go 
offshore.
  Flexible spending accounts are now limited. Who's affected by 
flexible spending accounts? Well, people with predictable recurrent 
medical expenses who might want to set some of those dollars aside and 
pay for them with pretax dollars. Those amounts are now limited, so 
people with chronic illnesses, families with special needs children are 
going to be affected.
  There's a surtax on investment income. The economy's trying to 
recover. Why would we tax investment income?
  Itemized deductions are now going to be limited for people who 
itemize their deductions. So who is affected by that? People with the 
highest medical expenses.
  And then finally, the Medicare payroll tax hike. Might sound like a 
good idea. Medicare might need more money, but this money doesn't go to 
Medicare. This money goes to fund new programs.
  Look, 3 years ago we were all told, if you like what you have, you 
can keep it. If you like your insurance, you can keep it. If you like 
your doctor, you can keep him or her.
  Turns out, what we should have been hearing is, you're going to pay a 
lot more to get a lot less.

  APPLAUDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S HISTORIC FIRST OPEN ENROLLMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2014

  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I rise today to applaud the 
Affordable Care Act's historic first open enrollment along with the 8 
million people who now have the health security they deserve.
  And I am proud of the immense contribution California has been to 
these surging numbers. More than 3 million California consumers 
enrolled in health insurance plans or in Medi-Cal.
  Moreover, after connecting my district to over 20 events and 
enrolling over 2,300 residents through my ``Enroll OC'' initiative, 
Orange County alone represented 10 percent of all California 
enrollments.
  These final enrollment numbers are promising and although we have 
surpassed our goals, enrollment is only the first step.
  We must now shift our focus to educating these new consumers about 
the services available to them through their health insurance 
providers.
  Therefore, as an effort to educate new consumers in my district, I 
will be initiating a new campaign and hosting ``Know Your Benefits'' 
events throughout Orange County.
  And I urge my colleagues to go beyond the kind of work necessary to 
reach those who the law was meant to help.

                      AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DEADLINE

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, with the deadline to sign up for the 
Affordable Care Act approaching, I want to encourage everyone, 
especially young people and people in my district, to sign up for 
health insurance.
  For those who think the process is too cumbersome or you won't get an 
affordable rate, listen to this story from a 29-year-old woman from New 
Jersey, Fawziah Qadir. She said: My employer agreed to provide $300 a 
month towards any health plan I could find.
  Unfortunately, trying to find an affordable insurance plan on her own 
in New Jersey where she lives, she said, was insane. One quote was over 
$700; others provided flimsy coverage.
  Full of frustration, Fawziah's mother told her about the health care 
insurance marketplace. She says that when she logged onto 
healthcare.gov, she was surprised to find out how easy it was to 
enroll.
  With her employer's contribution, she has a comprehensive plan that 
costs just $63 a month. That is less than a cell phone bill or a cable 
bill, and we are talking about something much more important--our 
Nation's health.
  Don't wait. Go to healthcare.gov and find a plan that works for you.

            HIDDEN TAXES INCLUDED IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, you wouldn't know it by the weather, but it 
will soon be April, and tax day is right around the corner. As 
Americans scramble to gather their W-2s and other important tax 
documents, many are unaware of the extra hidden taxes included in the 
Affordable Care Act that will ultimately fall on them.
  These hidden taxes will surprise and catch hardworking families and 
small businesses off guard and put a strain on family budgets that are 
already stretched thin.
  A 3.5 percent tax on insurance premiums, a 2.3 percent medical device 
tax--raising the cost of pacemakers, prosthetics, stents, and more--a 
tanning tax, an investment income and Medicare payroll surtax, the list 
goes on and on; and all these costs are passed on to Americans and 
families in our communities.
  That is hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars leaving our 
communities, out of the pockets of hardworking families in States like 
Kansas and heading to Washington, D.C.
  Mr. Speaker, with the many challenges Americans face today, the last 
thing they need this tax season is to carry a heavier government tax 
burden on their backs.

             GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, when we needed 
bipartisan action to lower costs and improve health care, Congress 
passed the Affordable Care Act on a party-line vote.
  Given the growing number of failures that have been revealed since 
the law's implementation began, it is time for Congress to work 
together to address the unworkable provisions for the good of the 
American people.
  Fortunately, opposition to the ACA's flawed policy is moving beyond 
party labels. Last year, the Democratic-led Senate voted 79-20 to 
repeal the law's medical device tax. Since then, more and more Members 
of Congress recognize there are bigger problems.
  Earlier in January, despite the Obama administration's vocal 
opposition to the efforts to boost consumer protections under the law, 
a veto-proof majority of Republicans and Democrats in the House voted 
to pass H.R. 3811, which would help secure personal information on the 
online exchanges.
  Madam Speaker, the American people deserve bipartisan solutions.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mrs. NEGRETE McLEOD asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. NEGRETE McLEOD. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is moving 
in the right direction and delivering what the law was intended to do: 
delivering a wider range of medical services to all Americans, 
including improved access to mental health services.
  The administration announced that $100 million of additional funding 
would be made available to expand and improve the way Americans receive 
mental health services.
  According to the California HealthCare Foundation, nearly one in six 
Californian adults has a mental health need and approximately one in 20 
suffers from a serious mental illness that makes it difficult to carry 
out major life activities. The rate among children is higher where one 
in 13 suffers from a mental illness that limits participation in daily 
activities.
  While most mental illnesses are treatable, those with mental illness 
often struggle to get needed treatment if they do not have health 
insurance that covers mental health services. Starting next year, 
insurers would not be able to deny coverage or charge an individual 
more due to preexisting health conditions, including mental illnesses. 
The health care law would also require most health plans to cover 
recommended preventive services like depression screening for adults 
and behavior assessment for children.

  A woman by the name of Melanie wrote the following letter to the L.A. 
Times:

       My daughter and I have been without health care for 3 years 
     following my loss of employer-provided insurance. In that 
     period, I have paid handsomely for those times when my 
     mother-ministrations were not sufficient and I had to seek 
     the care of a very expensive doctor. I've been waiting 
     eagerly for ObamaCare for the two of us since the law was 
     enacted in 2010.
       Did I run into problems when I first tried to sign up in 
     California? I did.
       Did I persevere? I did.
       Did I finally get through? I did.
       In January, I'll be able to take care of a condition I've 
     ignored for the last 2 years, and my college-age daughter 
     will be covered as well. Although the subsidy certainly 
     helps, I will be paying something for coverage we haven't had 
     for years. To those who cry foul, I say ``score.''

  Mr. Speaker, I couldn't have said it better. The reality is that 
because of ObamaCare, millions of vulnerable Americans now ``score.''

                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS UNAFFORDABLE

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, some are trying to create the 
impression that the only problem with ObamaCare is the Web site, and 
the experts will soon fix that. Actually, the biggest problem with the 
so-called Affordable Care Act is that it is unaffordable.
  We are already having trouble paying for all of the Federal medical 
programs we have now. The cost of all of our Federal medical programs 
have been greatly underestimated at the start.
  Now with many millions more losing their coverage than the 
administration predicted, added to the millions previously uninsured, 
the cost of ObamaCare is already estimated at possibly four times more 
than when it was passed, and it is not even fully in place.
  Since it took 3\1/2\ years to even get a screwed-up Web site 
partially ready, most people don't believe the Federal Government can 
run our health care system efficiently in the first place. More 
bureaucratic, less-humane medical care, and all at much greater cost to 
taxpayers at both the Federal and State levels.
  This plan is a mess that will ultimately lead to shortages, waiting 
periods, and a great decline in the quality of American medical care.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. McCAUL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Affordable 
Care Act.
  As the American people know, Members of Congress now are covered by 
this law. And, rightly so, we should engage in the D.C. exchange. I 
want to tell you about my personal experience with the D.C. exchange.
  The President said you can keep your health care plan and that your 
premiums will go down. Mr. Speaker, I lost my health care plan. I have 
five children. My premiums have gone up significantly. I don't know if 
I can keep all the same doctors that treat my children.
  If this is such a great law, why isn't the President of the United 
States covered by this law? On day one, why didn't the President of the 
United States have a Rose Garden ceremony as customer number one under 
his law, ObamaCare, and sign up for this? The answer is that he hasn't 
signed up for it because maybe he doesn't think it is good enough for 
his family, but yet it is good enough for the American people.
  That is the height of hypocrisy and arrogance in Washington, and it 
needs to stop.

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues have highlighted the 
challenges of implementing the Affordable Care Act at the Federal 
level. While these must be addressed, I would like to take a minute to 
highlight the successes we have seen at the State level in Rhode 
Island. Although a majority of States opted not to operate an exchange 
of their own, Rhode Island chose to be a leader in creating a State-
driven, integrated marketplace to provide quality, affordable health 
insurance for its citizens.
  On October 1, Health Source RI, the Ocean State's online portal and 
health insurance marketplace, opened for business. It has successfully 
enrolled over 5,000 residents to date without many of the issues 
plaguing the Federal Web site. Of course, we are still at the beginning 
stages of this process, and efforts are under way to improve and expand 
the successful rollout with many of our State partners.
  This has been a highly collaborative effort, and I look forward to 
continuing our work together so that individuals, families, and small 
businesses can shop for insurance that meets their needs based on 
transparent, competitive pricing and robust coverage.

                          ____________________

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, even with the difficulties of the health care 
Web site, we are seeing great things coming out of this Affordable Care 
Act. Across the country, millions of people who lacked affordable 
health care options yesterday are checking out their new options today. 
This law is working.
  I continue to hear scores of success stories from California. 
Marilynn, who is a breast cancer survivor, was paying nearly $1,300 a 
month for her Anthem Blue Cross policy. Through Covered California, she 
is saving now more than $500 a month.
  Although the healthcare.gov Web site has had its problems--that we 
are fixing--know that the California exchange has become a model for 
the rest of the country. Early enrollment results demonstrate that 
Covered California is working and people are signing up. We led the 
Nation in our readiness for this new law, and newly released numbers 
show that 131,000 Californians have already enrolled in new quality 
health plans on Covered California, more than any other State exchange.
  Rather than rooting for its failure, let's work together to make this 
a reality for all Americans.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice 
the concerns of a small business in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional 
District, whose economic security is in jeopardy due to the Affordable 
Care Act.
  The is the story of a sixth-generation, family-run business that has 
been marginally profitable over the years. The business has grown 
through tough times, while staying committed to always providing health 
care insurance through policies that allow their employees the choice 
and the flexibility to have the doctor that they want.
  Since the ACA has taken effect, this business is now facing drastic 
increases in costs, which threaten their profitability and, in turn, 
this threatens jobs in our community.
  The President has offered the American public little assurance that 
he can save the plans, plans that he originally said we could keep. The 
public doesn't need another press conference or PR fix. They need real 
solutions moving forward.
  I commend my 39 Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who joined us in passing the Keep Your Health Plan Act today. These 
Members realize there needs to be accountability in government. The 
American people deserve as much.

             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT--A WINNER FOR SENIORS

  (Mr. COURTNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, the government announced yesterday good 
news for seniors: their Medicare part B premiums for 2014 will go up 
zero dollars and zero cents. It will stay at $104 per month. This is 
now the third year in a row that CMS Medicare part B premiums have 
defied the trustees' predictions and have come in lower than projected. 
It also defies the relentless campaign of misinformation that seniors 
have been subjected to that their Medicare part B premiums are going to 
go up.
  Just on Friday, I was at a senior fair where a woman showed me a 
chain email that read that Medicare part B premiums for 2014 were going 
up to $247 a month--just a viral infection that has been out there and 
that I have been confronted with at senior centers over and over again. 
The facts are that they are going up zero. Medicare Advantage premiums 
have stabilized. Medicare part B premiums have stabilized. Prescription 
drug costs have gone down because of closing the doughnut hole.
  In every respect, the Affordable Care Act since it passed in 2010 has 
been a winner for seniors, and it has helped strengthen the solvency of 
the program. Again, Medicare part B premiums are going up zero for 
2014.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that there is plenty to 
disagree about in Washington, D.C. The House majority continues to 
believe that funding special treatment for Members of Congress in the 
Affordable Care Act is wrong. The House majority continues to believe 
that the American people need a reprieve from the new government 
insurance mandate for 1 year--the same reprieve that has been given to 
businesses, unions, Congress, and other groups. We should all be 
treated equally and fairly under the law, and Congress should have to 
follow the same laws it dictates to the rest of America.
  But as we continue to negotiate over this divide, let's start funding 
the things we agree on. Let's fund veterans programs. Let's fund the 
NIH clinical trials. Let's fund Head Start, WIC programs. Let's open up 
the World War II Memorial. Surely, even in the divided times we live 
in, we could set aside our differences and start reopening the doors of 
government. This shutdown is wrong and the American people are hurting.
  Let's please start working together, getting past our differences, 
finding points of agreement, and let's forge ahead together united as 
Americans.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acquaint you and my 
colleagues with Mr. Butch Matthews, a 61-year-old former small 
businessman from Little Rock, Arkansas, who used to wake up every 
morning at 4 a.m. to deliver canned beverages to retailers before 
retiring in 2010.
  A lifelong Republican, he was heavily skeptical of the Affordable 
Care Act when it first passed. ``I did not think ObamaCare was going to 
be a good plan; I did not think it would help me at all'' is what he 
said. But after a little research, he has now found out that he can get 
a better plan than he already had and at the same time save $13,000 a 
year.
  When he was asked what would he say to people who are skeptical about 
the plan, Mr. Matthews says this: ``I would tell them to learn more 
about it before they start talking bad about it.''
  Mr. Speaker, he is still a real strong Republican, but he says: I'm 
very happy this came along.

                  BENEFITS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, western New York has long distinguished 
itself as a leader in innovation and cutting-edge medical research. 
Buffalo gave the world cancer research when the New York Cancer 
Laboratory was first established by Dr. Roswell Park in 1897. Today, 
the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus continues to grow and thrive with 
the expansion of Roswell Park, plans for the University of Buffalo 
Medical School, and construction of a new women and children's 
hospital.
  I'm pleased to say that today western New Yorkers continue to receive 
good news about the availability and accessibility of health care. 
Yesterday, The New York Times reported that New York State health 
insurance purchased through the State exchanges will reduce insurance 
rates by at least 50 percent. Additionally, thanks to the Affordable 
Care Act, 37,000 kids with preexisting conditions will not be denied 
coverage because by law they can't be denied coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, health care should be affordable and accessible to all 
Americans. The progress we have already seen is promising, and we must 
keep moving forward.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. MENG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this 
38th attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Our country needs affordable care. My constituents in Queens, New 
York, need affordable health care. Right now, only 17,000 New Yorkers 
buy their own health insurance because the insurance premium rates are 
too high, and 2.6 million New Yorkers do not have health insurance. 
Nationwide, 13 million people are uninsured.
  The most exciting part is that ObamaCare is already working. As of 
this morning, the new, approved health care premiums available in the 
New York State health care exchanges for 2014 are, on average, 50 
percent lower than this year's insurance premiums. That is not even 
taking into account individuals who can take advantage of other Federal 
subsidies and that everyone with a health insurance plan will be able 
to gain access to basic, free preventative health care services.
  I want to thank New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State 
Legislature for their leadership on this issue.
  With all the partisan sniping across the aisle about health care, we 
cannot lose sight of why our country needs ObamaCare. Better access to 
affordable, preventative health care is essential to reining in health 
care costs; and more importantly, it's essential for a healthy America.

             THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. DENT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, the House will again vote to address the 
imprecisely named Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Critics 
say that we're tilting at windmills. Well, Mr. Speaker, let's review:
  Within the last month or so, we've heard from the Senator who 
authored the law refer to it as a coming ``train wreck''--that's right, 
he called it a ``train wreck'';
  We've heard the administration official responsible for helping set 
up the insurance exchanges worry that the public might be in for a 
``Third World experience'' as they try and find health care;
  Oh, and let us not forget some of the very same Members of Congress 
who voted to foist this massive overreach on Americans are now 
feverishly trying to find ways to exempt themselves and their staffs 
from its effects.
  Let's look at the checklist, shall we?
  Premiums shooting up, check;
  Small businesses hiring fewer workers and jobs being lost, check;
  Employees seeing their hours cut, check;
  Faulty cost projections, check.
  Everything that opponents of this law listed as a reason to vote 
against this example of government overreach is actually occurring and 
happening.
  Tilting at windmills, Mr. Speaker, hardly. Working to protect the 
American people from a horribly disruptive and ineffective law, 
certainly.

                     SO-CALLED AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Americans want and need 
greater access to health care, and they deserve reforms that will lower 
costs and expand access, but without undermining quality and 
innovation.
  These were the promises of the President's health care reform law. 
They were worthy goals. Unfortunately, they are not reality.
  To the contrary, over the past 3 years, families and businesses have 
seen a 400 percent premium increase for health care. Patients are being 
denied coverage that physicians will not accept. Employers have slowed 
hiring under new costs and the fear of what is ahead.
  This Congress has rescinded funding for or completely repealed eight 
separate provisions of ObamaCare. Key provisions of the act are 
beginning to collapse under the weight of their own irreparable flaws. 
And even my Democratic colleagues have warned of the law's looming 
``train wreck.''
  Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. Full repeal of this 
flawed policy is the first step to enacting commonsense reforms to 
actually lower costs and expand access. Only then can we enact a law 
that can be truly called the ``Affordable Care Act.''

                       AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FIXES

  (Mr. BARBER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BARBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about commonsense 
actions we must take to fix the health care law. I wasn't in Congress 
in March of 2010 and I didn't vote for the Affordable Care Act, but I'm 
here today to ensure that it meets the needs of small businesses and 
middle class families.
  That's why I've spent a lot of time listening to small business 
owners and staff, to seniors, and to hospital employees and physicians 
in Arizona about their concerns. That is why I have cosponsored 
legislation to repeal the medical device tax, the annual tax on health 
insurance, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board. These actions 
will protect families and small businesses from premium hikes, and 
protect access to health care for seniors and all Americans. This is 
why I'm working with the citizens of Green Valley in my district to 
keep health care affordable by protecting the tax deduction for medical 
expenses.
  These are but a few examples of how we can come together to fix this 
law. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to find additional ways to do so.

                   REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. JOYCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOYCE. I rise in support of repealing the Affordable Care Act and 
preventing Ohioans from having to deal with higher health costs, $1.1 
trillion in tax hikes, and more government intrusion in their health 
care. As we near the full implementation of the health care law, it 
seems as though every day we receive more evidence that this law will 
increase health costs for ordinary Ohioans, place an enormous burden on 
Ohio small businesses owners--making it harder for those businesses to 
hire new workers--and insert more big government in between Ohioans and 
their doctors.
  My district in northeastern Ohio is home to several medical device 
manufacturing companies which will be especially hurt by the health 
care law's onerous medical device tax. It's crucial we repeal this law 
and replace it with commonsense health care legislation. Jobs and 
affordable health care are at stake.

                     BEYOND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this year the Supreme Court agreed to 
hear and issue a decision on the Affordable Care Act. Of course, I'm 
eager to see what happens, and I'll be following the case very 
carefully, as will millions of Americans. But important steps will need 
to be taken depending upon how the Court rules. Right now, we do not 
know if the Court will rule solely on the individual mandate or say 
that the entire law is unconstitutional. Either way, this House must be 
prepared.
  Now, House conservatives have been working for at least the past 3 
years, well before the Affordable Care Act was even passed, to craft 
policies that focused on patients instead of payments, that focused on 
quality instead of quantity, innovation instead of stagnation, and 
affordability as opposed to just being cheap.
  I'm fully committed to continuing this work and producing alternative 
legislation that will benefit the American people without putting an 
undue burden on the economy.
  The Congressional Health Care Caucus discussed this issue today at a 
briefing. James Capretta and Thomas Miller discussed and shared ways on 
which we can prepare in the coming months with specific policy ideas. 
Although no one has a clear idea of how the Court will rule, we do know 
that we need to work together to consider ideas and craft policies to 
take care of the American people when their decision is rendered.

            VOTE ``NO'' ON REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the reckless 
attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The new law has already put in place critical protections to help our 
families across this country. I want to tell the story of one family in 
my district whose life has been dramatically helped by this law, the 
Strong family of Santa Barbara.
  Bill and Victoria Strong's daughter, Gwendolyn, was diagnosed at age 
6 months with a rare disease, muscular spinal atrophy. Her care is 
extremely expensive; and before the new law, the Strongs lived in 
constant fear that Gwendolyn would reach her policy's lifetime limit, 
no longer be covered for treatments and be uninsurable because of her 
pre-existing condition.
  The elimination of lifetime caps has given the Strongs peace of mind. 
They are guaranteed Gwendolyn will receive the care she needs and their 
family is protected from bankruptcy.
  Repealing these safeguards will take that security away. It would put 
this courageous little girl at risk of having her health care cut off 
when she needs it most and it would put this inspiring family at risk 
of bankruptcy.
  I urge my colleagues to stand for all those who are benefiting from 
the law, as the Strong family is. Vote ``no'' on repealing the 
Affordable Care Act.

            LOOK AT WHAT'S REALLY IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Now that it's the law of the land, it's time for 
everyone in the country to take a deep breath and look at what really 
is in the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare.
  If you're a senior citizen, you're now receiving a 50 percent 
discount on brand name drugs if you fall into what is called the 
doughnut hole, the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap.
  If you're a woman, you now have free coverage of lifesaving 
preventive services such as mammograms; and beginning on August 1, free 
coverage is going to include many additional preventive care services, 
so take a good look at that.
  If you're a parent, if you have children under age 19, they cannot be 
denied coverage by an insurance company because they have a preexisting 
condition.
  And if you're a young adult, you can now stay on your parents' health 
care plan until your 26th birthday, which is really important if you 
don't have a job that has health insurance coverage.
  And if you're a small business owner, like my son is, there are 
millions now of eligible small business owners that are receiving tax 
credits if you choose to offer coverage to your employees.
  So take a look. It's really good for most Americans.

   TEXAS' DECISION NOT TO EXPAND MEDICAID AND THE VOTE TO REPEAL THE 
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, by refusing to 
expand Medicaid to cover millions of sick, low-income adults, Texas 
Governor Rick Perry has joined the growing list of Republican Governors 
who have decided to put partisan politics before the health of their 
residents.
  6.2 million Texans, including 1.2 million children, lack health 
insurance, the highest number of any State in the Nation. Medicaid 
expansion would drastically decrease Texas' uninsured rate from an 
astonishing 25 percent to just 9 percent.
  Without the Affordable Care Act, millions of uninsured Americans will 
continue to seek primary care in our Nation's overcrowded emergency 
rooms, leaving taxpayers, property owners, to foot the bill. As a 
nonpracticing registered nurse, I am all too familiar with this 
scenario, which has placed a tremendous burden on our Nation's hospital 
systems.
  Madam Speaker, the highest court in the Nation has spoken, and it's 
time for us to move forward for the American people.

                    DON'T REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Madam Speaker, I think it's worthwhile to remember why 
Congress passed health care reform in the first place. It's because our 
system was broken; it wasn't working.
  But just this morning, Speaker Boehner said that we needed to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act because we didn't need it because we had the 
best health care system the world has ever seen. Well, I don't think 
that was true for 17 million children who were being denied health 
insurance for preexisting conditions. I don't think that was true for 
about 3.1 million young adults who were denied coverage because they 
were kicked off their parents' insurance plans. And I don't think that 
was true for 40 million Americans who couldn't get coverage and for 
every family threatened with losing their coverage because of rising 
costs.
  If we need to tweak the law, let's work together to fix it, but let's 
not repeal it. I think that would be bad for our health.

                 GOP REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, today the House will consider a repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act for the 31st time. We will spend at least 6 
hours debating this, but not 1 minute considering a Republican 
replacement. That's because there isn't one.
  The American people are now experiencing the benefits of the law: 
allowing young people to stay on their parents' policies until the 
young people are 26; requiring insurance companies to cover children 
regardless of preexisting conditions. The Republican leadership had the 
choice to include those provisions and others in this bill. Yet, once 
again, they are choosing to deny care to millions of Americans instead.
  With this bill, the Republicans are choosing to cut young people off 
of their parents' coverage. They are choosing to end the guaranteed 
coverage for children with juvenile diabetes, autism, asthma, and other 
illnesses. They are choosing to raise prescription drug costs for 
seniors, and they are choosing to allow insurance companies to charge 
women more for the same policies as men.
  Madam Speaker, I invite any Republican in this body to come to the 
floor and to explain to my constituents and theirs why they've made the 
choice to repeal all of these patient protections while offering the 
American people nothing in return.

                          ____________________

             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I rise today because this is a great 
country. In fact, I would call it the greatest country in the world.
  Throughout my life's history, although we have traveled mountains and 
low valleys, I have been equal and unequal in this Nation. Yet today I 
feel as tall as the pine trees because our Supreme Court shed itself of 
diverse and sometimes divisive bickering and upheld the Constitution of 
the United States.
  It granted to the American people affordable health care. It granted 
to the sickest of the sick the opportunity to be covered by insurance. 
It granted to seniors who fall into doughnut holes and who have to 
choose prescription drugs over food a relief line. It granted to 
hospitals that take in indigent patients who may otherwise die on 
sidewalks in America an opportunity to take care of those patients. It 
gave children with preexisting diseases an opportunity to live fully in 
this country.
  So now the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. We have been 
vindicated. Every single, single vote of those Members who have lost 
and of those who have won, we've been vindicated. Thank God for the 
United States Supreme Court.

      THE FATE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AWAITS THE SUPREME COURT

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, here we are, 32 hours away from the Supreme 
Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act. No one has a clear idea of 
what their decision will be. We've worked hard in preparing for any 
decision that might come from the Supreme Court,

[[Page H3984]]

and their announcement will certainly be watched by all.
  As the chairman of the Congressional Health Caucus, I've held a 
series of policy forums to discuss the future of health care in this 
country. Today we heard from Dr. John Goodman, president and CEO of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas. Dr. Goodman has put a 
considerable amount of time into how to craft health care policy that 
will be beneficial to all Americans without the burdensome law that we 
currently have.
  Additionally, doctors in Dallas convened with four Members of 
Congress earlier this month. They produced a set of principles that I 
will provide for the Record. I encourage people to spend some time and 
look at those, and understand that we have to have health care in this 
country that's patient-centered, doctor-led, and most of all, we keep 
the government out of the way.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as the 2-year anniversary 
of the President's so-called Affordable Care Act approaches, we're 
reminded of the unkept promises. It almost seems like yesterday when we 
heard the line, ``We have to pass the bill so we can find out what's in 
it.'' That prediction

[[Page H1525]]

today stands as one of the few justifications for passage of the law to 
still hold much truth or credibility.
  Then supporters said it wouldn't cost a dime; yet last week, the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated they now expect the law 
to cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years. That's nearly double the $940 
billion originally claimed.
  Supporters said it would bring down costs; yet these new mandates 
have helped result in premium increases of up to 9 percent in my home 
State of Pennsylvania.
  Today we remain committed to repealing and replacing this costly and 
dangerous law, piece by piece, if necessary. We take a great step today 
by repealing a provision that would otherwise cede the responsibility 
of Congress to an unelected and unaccountable Medicare rationing board. 
This measure is yet another facet of that commitment.

                  BENEFITS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the ways that young 
people in my congressional district and around the country are 
benefiting from the Affordable Care Act.
  Before health reform, young adults were the age group most likely to 
be uninsured, losing their coverage right after they left home and 
entered the workforce; but thanks to the health reform law, 2\1/2\ 
million young people, including nearly 10,000 in my communities, now 
have health insurance. And some of them have reached out to tell us how 
the law is working for them and for their families.
  Jamie from Santa Barbara wrote:

       I got back on my parents' insurance and was finally able to 
     visit the dentist and get a new prescription for eyeglasses 
     that I desperately needed.

  Maria from Oxnard says:

       As a recent graduate. I felt completely vulnerable. With 
     health care reform, I am now able to stay with my parents' 
     health insurance, which has given me peace of mind while I 
     search for employment.

  Madam Speaker, health reform is working for young people on 
California's central coast. We must ensure the law stays strong to keep 
them and their families healthy, and I'll say the same for this entire 
Nation.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. MILLER of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support 
the provisions in the Affordable Care Act that close the gender gap in 
health care. Beginning in 2014, health insurers cannot charge women 
more just because of their gender. Health insurers cannot deny coverage 
because of preexisting conditions like having survived cancer or having 
been pregnant or having been a victim of domestic violence, a condition 
that is almost as disproportionately experienced by women as pregnancy. 
And health care will have to cover preventive services like mammograms, 
screening for cervical cancer and, yes, contraception.
  Republicans in Congress are trying to block these and other reforms 
so that health insurers or employers or Members of Congress can make 
women's health and reproduction decisions rather than trust those 
decisions to women. Madam Speaker, women can make those decisions. They 
really don't need help from insurers or employers or politicians or 
radio talk-show hosts. Women want to make those important personal 
decisions for themselves, and they should.

           OPPOSING REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. CARNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this 
counterproductive effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Instead, we 
ought to focus on how we can move forward together, Democrats and 
Republicans, to address the very serious challenge of rising health 
care costs. Among developed nations, the United States spends twice as 
much as a share of GDP on health care; yet we rank near the bottom in 
health outcomes.
  Insurance premiums more than doubled in the last decade. Absent 
reform, they are on pace to double again by 2020. These costs are 
unsustainable for Delaware families and for the Federal budget. There 
can't be serious conversation about deficit reduction without talking 
about health care cost containment. Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP alone 
consume one-quarter of the Federal budget. The Affordable Care Act will 
curb health care cost growth, but there is a lot more that needs to be 
done.
  I came to Congress to make the tough, thoughtful decisions necessary 
to improve the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it. And I look forward 
to working with my colleagues to do just that.

                    AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CANCELATIONS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Capps) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the Affordable Care 
Act. The Affordable Care Act is working for many of my constituents on 
the central coast of California, like Danna in San Luis Obispo County, 
who tells me she will be saving 40 percent on her family's premiums. It 
is working for the Pacelas in Solvang, who tell me they now have better 
coverage while saving $8,000 a year on their premiums. It is working 
for the thousands of families whose young adult children can continue 
on their parents' plans, and for everyone who has a preexisting 
condition who now cannot be turned down for coverage.
  I know that this is not the case for all central coast residents, 
especially those who may have received cancelation notices this year, 
either because their insurer is only selling in the exchanges, or 
because the insurance companies have stopped offering plans in our area 
all together. Cancelation of these plans has caused real pain and 
confusion for our constituents in California who are faced with Covered 
California marketplace options that have different provider networks or 
different premium costs.
  After hearing numerous stories from the families I represent, it is 
clear we must address this problem with the implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act so we can protect all California families and 
businesses. The President has offered an administrative fix to this 
issue to allow insurance companies to offer plans to those already 
enrolled for the next year, but States will be the final 
decisionmakers.
  That is why I led a letter, with Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and 22 of 
our California colleagues, to Covered California's leadership asking 
them to implement this administrative fix without delay.
  Covered California has led the way in bringing new, quality health 
care opportunities to millions of Californians. The Web site is 
working, and enrollment is steadily increasing. But with over 1 million 
Californians receiving cancelation notices of their current plans, we 
must and we will do more to ensure that no one is left without the 
opportunity for affordable coverage. These families were told that if 
they liked their plan they can keep it, and that is a promise we must 
keep for them.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, today, the President put forth some 
conversation about the Affordable Care Act that focuses especially on 
women's health. I am absolutely delighted to come to the floor to 
address that issue in that--and I hope every woman in America 
understands this--because of the Affordable Care Act, being a woman is 
no longer a preexisting medical condition. As the mother of five 
children--four daughters and one son--I am very excited about this.
  Over the break, I had the privilege of being at a meeting with some 
researchers on the subject of breast cancer in particular, and they 
spent a good deal of the time telling us what the possibilities were 
with research that should be funded--that is a budget issue, another 
subject, but one that is related here--and that we could remove this 
threat to women's health with proper research.
  They took time to say that one thing that was helping women with 
breast cancer more than anything was the Affordable Care Act--that they 
would have access to care without being discriminated against because 
of a preexisting medical condition, that no longer would they have 
annual or lifetime limits on the health insurance that they would 
receive. The relief of the stress from all of that is a very healthy 
thing for people who have a diagnosis.
  So whatever it is--whether it is mammograms as my colleague 
Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz so generously shared her story 
with us about her experience or, earlier, as Congresswoman DeLauro 
shared hers and as other Members shared the stories of their 
constituents--this is really very important. Moms are the hubs of 
families. Many of them fear this diagnosis. Many families in America 
have been affected by it.
  With our investments in research and with the Affordable Care Act, 
women have reason to be very, very hopeful that this can be prevented 
with early detection--and not only with early detection but with 
regular detection. Then, on top of that, if they have that feared 
diagnosis, they will receive the care that they deserve.
  There is one other point I want to make about it because we all 
worship at the altar of biomedical research and what it means for our 
country and the thought that we could be rid of breast cancer in a 
handful of years: we want to make sure every woman in America and every 
person in America benefits from that research. The vehicle for that is 
the Affordable Care Act. It stands right there with Social Security, 
with Medicare, with affordable--and that is the word, ``affordable''--
health care for all Americans as a pillar of health and economic 
security for the American people.
  Today, we focus on moms--we focus on women--and we say, Thank God. No 
longer will being a woman be a preexisting medical condition.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Carson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, this week the House is voting to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 37th time.
  In every congressional district, there are seniors, new mothers, 
young children, low-income families, and young adults just starting out 
on their own. Do my good Republican friends really want to take away 
their chance for better health?
  I would never do that to my constituents, which is why I'm here 
today, Mr. Speaker, to say again, I am proud of my vote for the 
Affordable Care Act.

                              {time}  1030

  Recently, I had a chance to spend some time with some Hoosiers across 
my district, and I heard again and again their worry about rising 
health care costs and their family's ability to access care. 
Fortunately, millions of Americans no longer have to worry about 
accessing care because of the Affordable Care Act. Instead, more than 
half a million Medicare beneficiaries in Indiana alone received free 
preventive services in 2012, avoiding more costly illnesses. More than 
17 million children with preexisting conditions nationwide are no 
longer being denied insurance coverage. More than 100 million Americans 
no longer face lifetime limits on coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, over 360,000 small businesses have already used tax 
credits to help insure 2 million workers. By the end of this year, 
health exchanges will be set up making it easier for people who don't 
have insurance to choose the coverage that best suits their needs. Next 
year, we will happily welcome even more consumer protections. Insurance 
companies will no longer be able to place lifetime limits on coverage. 
Discrimination against preexisting conditions will be banned for all 
Americans.
  This means that when a woman notices a lump under her arm, there is 
no reason for her to wait until she finds a job to schedule an 
appointment. And she doesn't have to wait to get sicker, costing more 
of her time off from work and away from her family. Under the 
Affordable Care Act, Mr. Speaker, she knows she can obtain potentially 
lifesaving care right away. The same goes for her spouse, her parents, 
and her children. Our health care system benefits us by allowing us to 
make investments in lower-cost treatments and prevention now rather 
than expensive therapies later.
  Of course, I know that times are tough right now and we have to be 
even more careful about the mandates we put on businesses. But my good 
Republican colleagues seem to forget that people have to be healthy to 
contribute to our economic growth. As a Representative of many 
hardworking families, Mr. Speaker, I have stood here time and time 
again over the past few years to extend a hand to anyone who wants to 
work with me and us to provide quality health care for all Americans.
  Today, I make that very same offer. I will work gladly with anyone 
who wants to improve our health care system and ensure that all 
Americans have access to quality and affordable health care.
  I call on my Republican colleagues to work with us to implement the 
Affordable Care Act and start improving it. It's time we all stand 
together, Mr. Speaker, and start looking out for the health of this 
great Nation. Without it, we have nothing.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, roughly 
17 million American children with preexisting medical conditions can no 
longer be discriminated against and be denied health insurance by 
insurance companies. And yet, rather than focus on the key tasks of 
creating jobs and strengthening the middle class in America, my 
Republican colleagues want to tear up the health care law. They want to 
rip up the independent decision by our Supreme Court, by Justices 
appointed by Presidents of both parties, finding the Affordable Care 
Act is on firm constitutional footing, and they want to start all over 
again, putting the coverage of those millions of children I just spoke 
about at risk.
  This vote is personal. Health care is personal. When I was 9, I had a 
serious childhood illness. I spent 3 months in the hospital. My 
grandparents, who were raising me, found out that their family 
insurance didn't cover me. They made great sacrifices to help pay for 
my care. But if that weren't enough, when my grandparents then looked 
for insurance that would cover me, they couldn't find coverage at any 
price. I was considered one of those kids with a preexisting medical 
condition, never mind that I had fully recovered from my illness. No 
child should ever be denied coverage for that reason.
  I grew up believing that no family should have to go through what 
ours did. Parents or grandparents shouldn't have to worry, shouldn't 
have to lay awake at night worrying about whether they can provide for 
a sick child or whether an illness might bankrupt their family.
  Families now know that insurance companies can't discriminate against 
their children based on a preexisting condition. Turning back the clock 
so insurance companies can, once again, deny children access to care is 
simply wrong.
  It is time that we all move forward. It is time that we work 
together. It is time to make this Affordable Care Act work for the 
American people.

[Pages H1436-H1437]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, this week, we're marking the second 
anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. I wanted to take 
a few minutes to speak to a number of groups that have benefited from 
the health care reform, a reform which I strongly supported.
  If you think back to the time of the debate 2 years ago, it was at 
the height of hearing stories about people across the country, millions 
of people, who were struggling to access the health care system. So let 
me speak to the struggles of two or three particular groups.
  Many adults across the country had had the experience of trying to 
get health care coverage, health care insurance, and discovering that 
because they had a ``preexisting condition,'' as it's so called, that 
they would be denied that coverage. If you look at some of the policies 
even today, you can see that the list of preexisting conditions is a 
long one. You don't have to have some kind of exotic disease or 
condition. Diabetes, hypertension, other things that plague millions of 
Americans across the country could be the basis for an insurance 
company denying coverage to you.
  As difficult as that experience was for many adults to have when they 
went to try to purchase coverage because they had a preexisting 
condition, the most heart-wrenching stories we heard were of parents 
who had a child that suffered from a preexisting condition, and that 
child was unable to get health insurance coverage. It literally was 
tearing the hearts out of families across this country. One of the 
things that the Affordable Care Act put in place was a prohibition 
against denying coverage for children based on a preexisting condition. 
That is now law as a result of the Affordable Care Act.
  Those who argue that we should repeal the Affordable Care Act, I 
cannot believe that they want to go back to a time when a family would 
have to look at their child who had a preexisting condition and know 
that they couldn't get coverage, couldn't provide health care for that 
child. I can't believe that we want to go back to that.
  A second group that benefited are young people, many of whom after 
they graduated from college could no longer stay on the health 
insurance plan of their parents because it wasn't provided for. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, if you're a young person, you can now stay on 
your parents' health insurance plan until age 26.

                              {time}  1110

  This is making a huge difference for millions of Americans across the 
country. Already hundreds of thousands have taken advantage of the 
opportunity to stay on the insurance plan of their parents, which means 
that young people, many of whom think that they're invincible but then 
something happens to them and they need that health insurance coverage, 
now they'll have it. It's still in place because, under the Affordable 
Care Act, there's now a requirement that health insurance plans cover 
young people until age 26.
  I cannot believe that those who want to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act want to go back to a situation where millions of young people can't 
access that health insurance coverage.
  And let me talk about the third group, our seniors who, 2 years ago, 
were dealing with the situation of having to come out of pocket for 
prescription drugs because of the so-called doughnut hole under the 
prescription drug benefit program. Under the Affordable Care Act, we 
put in place the opportunity now to begin closing the doughnut hole and 
making sure that seniors who are in the doughnut hole have access to a 
50 percent discount on prescription drugs, brand-name prescription 
drugs.
  So now our seniors, many of whom before were having to make a choice 
between do I cover the cost of food, do I pay the rent, or do I cover 
the cost of my prescription drugs because they were having to come out 
of pocket, now, many of them don't have to make that terrible choice 
because of the assistance provided by the Affordable Care Act.
  I cannot believe that those who are urging the repeal of health care 
reform want to take our seniors back to a place where they have to make 
that terrible choice between whether to

[[Page H1437]]

cover the rent, buy food, or pay for their prescription drugs.
  Madam Speaker, there are so many good things already in place as a 
result of the health care reform, and I cannot believe that those who 
want to repeal it want to deny our children, want to deny our young 
people, want to deny our seniors the benefits that it provides.

                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, the centerpiece of President Obama's 
2008 Presidential campaign was the promise of health care reform. He 
told us, time and time again, that every President has seen the urgency 
of reform, that all of them had attempted reform, and none succeeded.

[[Page H4071]]

  President Obama reminded us of the fact that having more than 40 
million uninsured Americans is unacceptable. It is not only bad for the 
individual, but it is for the American economy. It is bad for hospitals 
who absorb the loss for these indigent patients or shift the costs to 
other patients.
  During the campaign, the President went on to painfully highlight the 
unfair practices of some insurance companies in making people think 
they have quality insurance policies, when, in fact, in many instances, 
it is not worth the paper it is written on.
  After fierce debate, and after the right-wing Tea Party instilled 
unfounded fear in the hearts of good Americans, the Congress passed the 
Affordable Care Act, and it is good policy for the American people. But 
there are those who have exploited the legitimacy of the Affordable 
Care Act, and now we await a ruling from the Supreme Court on the act's 
constitutionality.
  Should the Supreme Court decide to undermine the most vital provision 
of the law, the individual mandate, one thing will be clear: it would 
be an act of judicial activism and judicial overreach, placing the 
Court firmly in the role of Congress.
  Precedent for the Affordable Care Act already exists. Social Security 
is a program which all Americans are required to pay into and to 
participate. Car insurance is mandated in almost every State; yet the 
Supreme Court is on precipice of possible unfastening the linchpin that 
makes true health care reform attainable.
  Such a decision would confiscate benefits that the public and 
businesses largely support. Lifetime coverage limits could be re-
imposed on 100 million Americans. Seventeen million children with 
preexisting conditions could lose insurance coverage, and 6 million 
young adults may be forced off their parents' insurance plans.
  Preservation of this law means 40 million uninsured Americans will be 
insured. It creates state-run health exchanges to give consumers 
maximum choice when selecting a policy, and it contains skyrocketing 
costs in medical care. The Affordable Care Act will lower insurance 
premiums driven by uncompensated care for the uninsured, saving the 
average family in North Carolina $1,400 a year.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act has already paid great dividends 
in my district. Under the law, 94,000 seniors have received Medicare 
preventive services without paying a dime. More than 5,000 young adults 
have health insurance when they previously did not. About 400 small 
businesses received tax credits to expand care to their employees; 
34,000 children with preexisting health conditions can no longer be 
denied.
  As a policy-maker representing 700,000 people, I hope the act will 
remain intact. As a former judge, I hope the Supreme Court recognizes 
the impact an unfavorable decision will have on the role of Congress.
  We cannot let the perfect, Mr. Speaker, be the enemy of the good. We 
should explore ways to improve upon the law instead of ways to further 
deny Americans access to affordable health care.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I, along with most Americans, celebrated 
Mother's Day yesterday with my wife, my daughter, and my grandchildren, 
to express our appreciation for what mothers all over the world have 
done in order to help our communities. In America, we have taken action 
to help women in this country. I am referring to the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act, which has helped childbearing women and child 
rearing throughout the child's life, as well as the mother and the 
family.
  Let me give some examples because I think it is good to point out 
where we have made progress and to celebrate what we have done to help 
women in America. We have taken on the arbitrary practices of private 
insurance companies that discriminated against women, against pregnant 
women, and against mothers. A woman can now choose her own OB/GYN 
doctor as her primary care doctor, no longer having to wait for 
authorization or to get a referral in order to have OB/GYN care. Women 
now have the absolute right to choose their own primary care doctor, 
including an OB/GYN.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman in America is guaranteed 
an annual well-woman visit to be able to assess their health, including 
mammography screening, pap smears, diabetes screening, and other 
preventive screenings services at no cost. That is all provided in the 
Affordable Care Act, so a woman can take care of her own health care 
needs and, in many cases, avoiding much more costly and debilitating 
care. Again, this is at no cost. So there is no reason why a woman 
cannot take advantage of these services. HPV DNA testing is now 
available every 3 years under the Affordable Care Act to deal with the 
sexual health of women. STI counseling and HIV screening for sexually 
active women are now available under the Affordable Care Act. This is 
now guaranteed. Women don't have to go look at the fine print of an 
insurance policy to see whether they have coverage. Before, in most 
cases, they didn't have coverage. Women don't have to wait for 
authorization, having to show a need. These are given rights that are 
now available to every woman under the Affordable Care Act.
  No longer can pregnancy be considered a preexisting condition. Before 
the passage of the Affordable Care Act, if a woman wanted to get an 
insurance policy, insurers excluded childbirth during the first perhaps 
9 months or later. It was considered a preexisting condition. Now we 
have a seamless system, so women can get the type of care they need.
  Why does that become so important? So they can get the necessary 
prenatal care in order to keep their baby healthy, to get the type of 
tests that are necessary.
  Pregnant women can now get a gestational diabetes screening to see 
whether they are at high risk and, if so, they can get the type of 
treatment they need in order to make sure their baby is born as healthy 
as possible.
  Prenatal care is available and it is covered, and we now have, 
through the Affordable Care Act, a provision we added that provides 
support for qualified health centers. I have visited qualified health 
centers in Maryland that are now providing prenatal care that wasn't 
there before. It is not only that we are providing coverage; we are 
providing access to care, so we can reduce low birth weight babies in 
our community. Look at the numbers of infant survival. Look at the 
numbers of low birth weight babies. We are improving those numbers 
daily because of the Affordable Care Act. To be able to prevent and 
discover complications during pregnancy, including preterm outcomes--
all of that is now available.
  Women now have access to folic acid to make sure a woman has a 
healthier fetus and birth. All of that is now available under the 
Affordable Care Act.
  We help newborns and their mothers. Breast feeding has been proven to 
be a very strong part of a healthy infancy and for a baby. There are 
certain needs a mother has, including having the time to breast feed, 
and the cost of breast feeding, including breast pumps. That is now 
covered under the Affordable Care Act.
  We understand the need to keep people healthier, and that is why we 
call it

[[Page S2894]]

a wellness program. No longer is it insurance just to take care of an 
illness or injury; it is to keep people healthy and for women 
particularly. We didn't do a good job for many years. We are now making 
up for it in the Affordable Care Act, making a huge difference.
  We are giving peace of mind to women all over this country about 
having adequate third-party coverage so they can afford to take care of 
their own health and the health of their families.
  Adult children can remain on parents' insurance policies until age 
26. We have all received so many letters from our constituents saying: 
Thank goodness we have that provision. My 24-year-old never thought she 
would get ill. Now she has this insurance coverage so we can take care 
of her and keep her healthy, and when she needs health care, it is 
available, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.
  Today millions of Americans today who didn't have it before, now have 
quality, affordable health insurance as a result of the Affordable Care 
Act. It is peace of mind. They can now carry an insurance card. I got a 
letter from one of my constituents saying how it felt to have an 
insurance card in her possession, knowing that it worked as a ticket to 
take care of her health care and the health care of her family.
  No longer can an insurance company discriminate in ratings against 
women--a huge deal. The discriminatory rates were aimed against women, 
and we have eliminated that under the Affordable Care Act.
  We have eliminated preexisting condition restrictions. I already 
talked about pregnancy. But it was amazing how women particularly were 
discriminated against because of preexisting conditions, where they 
couldn't get full coverage to take care of all of their needs. That is 
over, including for their children. Many families told us they had a 
child with asthma and they couldn't get full coverage. Now they can get 
full coverage, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. They now have peace 
of mind and adequate coverage to take care of their needs.
  We had the end of the caps on health insurance. No longer do people 
have to worry: Should I do this or not? Will I hit my annual limit or 
my lifetime limit?
  They are gone. If they need insurance, it is there to protect them. 
That is what insurance should do: Protect families.
  So we have made a huge difference.
  I am particularly proud of the prudent layperson provision for 
emergency care. I can't tell my colleagues how many times we had 
circumstances where people needed to go to the emergency room because 
they thought they had a true emergency with chest pain and sweating, 
and they would go to the emergency room. The good news was they weren't 
having a heart attack. The bad news is they got a bill from their 
insurance company telling them that because they didn't have a heart 
attack they have to pay this bill. That is over. We have now legislated 
the prudent layperson standard so it is now right for a person to seek 
urgent care, and the insurance company must cover that visit for urgent 
care.
  I could continue to list so many ways we have helped all people in 
this country but particularly women. It is tough enough to give birth 
to a baby and to raise a child. We have made it easier by taking away 
some of the burdens regarding our health care system.
  So this past Sunday, when we celebrated Mother's Day, we could also 
point to a very tangible accomplishment this Congress has been able to 
deliver for all of our mothers in this country, and I was proud to be a 
part of making that a reality.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

[Pages S6138-S6139]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, 3 years ago Congress passed a massive 
health insurance law which didn't have a single Republican vote, and it 
had significant opposition by the public.
  In an administration proclaiming to be the most transparent ever, 
this 2,700-page bill was rammed through Congress in the early morning 
hours on Christmas Eve. Even then-Speaker of the House Pelosi said 
Congress had to pass this bill so that we could find out what was in 
it.
  Well, we did. It was passed, and the American people are not liking 
what they have discovered.
  While the President promised the Affordable Care Act would lower 
health care costs and strengthen our health care system, the law, 
instead, is increasing health insurance premiums, slowing economic 
recovery, and hindering job creation. We should not allow the 
administration to continue to ignore this reality. We must permanently 
delay the Affordable Care Act.

[[Page S6139]]

  Since its enactment in 2010, 18 components of the health care law 
have been changed, cancelled, or delayed. The President downplays the 
law's substantial defects by characterizing them as ``glitches and 
bumps'' that are to be expected. He also claims that the Affordable 
Care Act critics are responsible for the law's broken promises by 
arguing that the problem is with ``folks out there who are actively 
working to make this law fail.'' Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act is 
slowly unraveling.
  Every day brings new information about missed deadlines, funding 
shortfalls, soaring health insurance premium rates, and a technical 
implementation that is floundering. Is it any wonder that this law 
continues to be publicly unpopular?
  With the majority of mandates, fees, and taxes taking effect in 2014, 
we are already beginning to see the alarming effects of the law on 
individuals, families, employers, and on our economy. It is one broken 
promise after another.
  Promise No. 1. In attempting to convince the American people that the 
ACA was good, the President promised it would ``save families $2,500 in 
the coming years.'' But since 2008, the average American family has 
seen health insurance premiums rise more than $3,000. Nonpartisan 
actuaries estimate that national health spending will grow at an 
average rate of close to 6 percent annually between 2011 and 2021. As 
national spending ticks up, American families will continue to see 
their monthly premiums go up.
  States are beginning to release details on the rates consumers will 
pay for ACA-related health insurance starting on January 1. An 
unfortunate pattern is emerging--ACA-mandated insurance is going to 
increase costs for many Americans.
  Recently, the State of Indiana announced that insurance rates will 
increase 72 percent for consumers in the individual market. Consumers 
in Ohio, Florida, South Carolina, and Maryland have also announced they 
are expecting to see their premiums increase significantly. Just 
yesterday, the Georgia insurance commissioner asked the Department of 
Health and Human Services to extend the deadline to approve health 
plans in their State because some rates were expected in Georgia to 
rise by 198 percent.
  In my home State of Kansas, I consistently hear concerns from 
individuals, business owners, and even local government officials about 
the impending costs of the Affordable Care Act.
  For example, rural Kansas school districts and special education co-
ops, whose budgets are already stretched thin, will now be forced to 
cover the costs associated with the law. This has resulted in 
reductions in employees' hours and may trigger layoffs in order for the 
districts to avoid significant ACA-related penalties.
  It is sad to visit with the director of a special education co-op 
only to learn that less services are going to be provided to special 
needs students because of the costs associated with the Affordable Care 
Act.
  The American people were promised savings and security. Instead, we 
are experiencing less of both. The Affordable Care Act is leaving 
Americans with less options and simply unaffordable care.
  Promise No. 2. In 2009, the President said:

       No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this 
     promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep 
     your doctor, period.

  Reality has since whittled down this promise dramatically. If you go 
to the Affordable Care Act Web site today, you will find this far less 
confident statement:

       Depending on the plan you choose in the Marketplace, you 
     may be able to keep your current doctor.

  Even large labor unions have recently criticized the President and 
congressional Democrats for breaking this promise. Notably, the 
National Treasury Employees Union, the union that represents most IRS 
employees, is urging its members to write their elected officials to 
oppose any effort that would force them to participate in the health 
insurance exchanges.
  Further, several unions stated:

       When you and the President sought our support for the 
     Affordable Care Act (ACA), you pledged that if we liked the 
     health plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that 
     promise is under threat.

  And another statement:

       [A]pproximately 3 million laborers, retirees, and their 
     families now face the very real prospect of losing their 
     health benefits. This, I must remind you, was something that 
     you promised would not happen.

  Promise No. 3. The President indicated that the Affordable Care Act 
would ``lower costs for . . . the federal government, reducing our 
deficit by over $1 trillion in the next two decades. It is paid for. It 
is fiscally responsible.''
  The only way the Affordable Care Act will reduce deficits is by 
grossly increasing the taxes and fees associated with this law. One 
wonders how anyone believed at the time that the new entitlement 
program would ever save money.
  These broken promises are more than just words. The administration's 
false starts and early failures in implementing the Affordable Care Act 
are just the beginning. The harm this law will do to individuals, 
families, and businesses will continue to emerge. In less than 3 
months, individuals will be asked to start enrolling in a health 
insurance exchange when insurance rates, coverage requirements, and 
subsidy amounts are still largely unknown. And, increasingly, the 
question being asked is, What happens to individuals required to buy 
health insurance or face penalties if the exchanges are not ready on 
time?
  I am the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Labor, Health and Human Services. I offered two amendments to the 
fiscal year 2014 bill that would bring some certainty to this 
overarching issue.
  First, I offered an amendment to codify the administration's decision 
to delay the employer mandate. While many of my colleagues on the 
Democratic side issued press releases praising the administration's 
decision to delay, when asked to affirmatively vote in committee to 
delay for 1 year, they all voted no. The amendment failed on a straight 
party-line vote.
  The second amendment I offered delayed the implementation and 
enforcement of the individual mandate for 1 year. While I support the 
delay of the employer mandate, in that decision, like it or not, the 
administration undermined its own credibility in stating that the 
Affordable Care Act would be implemented on time, as promised. We 
should not, and cannot, require individuals to risk their health care 
coverage by signing up for an unworkable program with a dubious 
future. Unfortunately, my colleagues--again, on the Democratic side--
disagreed. They refused to extend the exemption the President granted 
to businesses to families and individuals--to all Americans.

  The evidence continues to show that the Affordable Care Act is so 
large and convoluted that it cannot be implemented into practice. 
Reports from State actuaries, the Congressional Budget Office, the 
Government Accountability Office, and nonpartisan think tanks have 
reached the same conclusion: Almost everything we were told about the 
Affordable Care Act is untrue.
  We were told 3 years ago that we need to pass the Affordable Care Act 
to find out what is in it. Now we know, and it is not good. We don't 
need to force American families to endure another 3 years just to see 
how bad it actually will be.
  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no one can dispute that Winston Churchill 
was a statesman and the most famous in the history of our world. This 
is what he said:


[[Page S2136]]


       Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between 
     the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the 
     future.

  Why do I say that? Even though those remarks were made more than 70 
years ago, I believe there are many in Congress who should focus on 
what Winston Churchill said because it is true. For far too long 
Republicans have obsessed over the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare. The 
Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It has been for more than 4 
years.
  From the very day this law was signed, Republicans have zealously 
worked to undermine it in so many different ways. Day in and day out 
they have clamored for repeal of this bill. House Republicans have 
voted more than 50 times trying desperately to cripple ObamaCare. They 
shut down the government trying to defund health care reform. And how 
has that worked? While they have obsessed over the past, the country 
has moved forward.
  Now Republicans have to face the fact that millions of their own 
constituents, millions of Republicans are benefiting from health care 
reform in record numbers. But my Republican friends still insist on 
nothing short of repeal. So I ask my Republican colleagues, what would 
they like to repeal? What would repeal look like?
  Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans can no 
longer be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. 
What are some of the preexisting conditions that caused so much trouble 
in the past? Diabetes. How about this one: You are a woman. Many 
insurance companies considered women having a preexisting disability 
because they were women. Millions of young adults are now able to stay 
on their parents' policies until age 26. That is more than 3 million. 
Millions of seniors are saving huge amounts of money on prescription 
drugs because we are in the process of filling the doughnut hole. This 
year alone millions of Americans will receive maternity coverage. 
Repealing the Affordable Care Act would be repealing many of these and 
many more. I could spend a long time talking about what would be 
repealed.
  My counterpart, the Senator from Kentucky, will probably address the 
Senate after I finish. In his home State of Kentucky, 360,000 people 
have signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky is 
not New York; it is not Texas; it is not California. It is a sparsely 
populated State, somewhat like Nevada. Yet 360,000 people have signed 
up for coverage. Of those, 75 percent were previously uninsured. That 
is approaching 300,000 people. Over a quarter million Kentuckians who 
did not have insurance now have health coverage under the Affordable 
Care Act. In other words, ObamaCare has reduced the uninsured 
population of Kentucky by 40 percent.
  I wonder when my friend from Kentucky will explain to the 270,000 
Kentuckians how he plans to repeal the law without stripping the new 
health benefits. How exactly will he and his Republican colleagues 
guarantee that their newly insured constituents have no lapses in 
coverage? Remember, they want to do away with 270,000 people who didn't 
have insurance. They want to do away with 360,000 people in Kentucky 
who are signed up for insurance. So I await their answer.
  In the meantime, Democrats will keep looking to the future, and the 
future of the Affordable Care Act is bright. Every day more and more 
Americans are getting health coverage under the law. On Monday we 
learned that 7,045,000 people had already signed up and about 1 million 
people on the State exchanges--370,000 in Kentucky, for example. We 
know there are more than 3 million young people on their parents' 
insurance because of that. We know there are millions of people who are 
now covered because of their ability to become part of Medicaid. So we 
are talking about a lot of people.
  Health reform is working, and the law is here to stay. The more 
Americans see the law is working, the more they want it to stay. The 
time of fighting over the past is over. Remember what Winston Churchill 
said:

       Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between 
     the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the 
     future.

  I say this very seriously: I invite my Republican friends to look to 
the future. Put this obstruction behind them. Work with us to make the 
Affordable Care Act even better for their constituents and our 
constituents and Americans generally. Together, we can help millions 
more Americans get the health coverage they deserve.

             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND PREVENTIVE HEALTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, 27 years ago, I was diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer. I was lucky. I had excellent doctors who detected the cancer by 
chance in stage 1. I underwent radiation treatment for 2\1/2\ months. 
Because of the grace of God and biomedical research, I stand here 
today, and I am fortunate to say that I have been cancer free ever 
since.
  I can tell you for a fact that access to preventive health care saved 
my life. If

[[Page H7455]]

my ovarian cancer had not been diagnosed and caught in stage 1, I might 
not be here today, but many women are not so lucky as over 15,000 die 
every year from ovarian cancer. While I survived by that off chance of 
luck in that diagnosis, no one should have to survive by luck, which is 
why my Democratic colleagues and I worked hard.
  We worked very hard to make sure that prevention and wellness are 
such a critical part of the Affordable Care Act. Before we passed this 
transformative piece of legislation, one in five women over age 50 had 
not had a mammogram in the past 2 years, mostly because she could not 
afford one. Now mammograms are covered--they are covered for all 
Americans--with no out-of-pocket costs. So are annual checkups, 
colonoscopies, diabetes, and other cancer screenings--at no cost. Let 
me repeat that. They are the beneficiaries of lifesaving treatments.
  Preventive care not only helps to keep Americans healthier; it also 
helps to drive down the cost of health care so that people can get 
access to the services that they need. Chronic and often preventable 
diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, cause seven out of 10 
deaths in the United States of America, and they account for 75 percent 
of our health spending. Preventive care can help Americans avoid these 
ailments or to catch them before it is too late.
  That is what the Affordable Care Act does. That is what the people of 
this country need to know. There are countless stories, after stories, 
after stories of people's lives being saved because they have the 
opportunity to get a treatment or something that says you may be at 
risk for a particular disease, and you can get that identification not 
by luck but as a routine checkup. No one in the United States of 
America should survive by luck. Now we have an opportunity through the 
Affordable Care Act, which is the law of the land today, to make sure 
that everyone--man and woman--can get those services.
  If you expand access to preventive health, it drives the costs down, 
but most importantly, it saves lives. Isn't that worth doing, to be 
able to save someone's life? That is what the Affordable Care Act is 
all about. It is just one of the many ways that it is good for men, for 
women, for families in this Nation, and it is good for America to move 
in this direction.

                   REPAIRING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, my son played basketball at Dillard 
University. I went down to see his games as often as I could. On one 
occasion, we were driving around in his car, we were at a busy 
intersection, and the car stops. I didn't know what was wrong, but 
eventually I realized that he simply didn't have gas in it. I was not 
happy, but I didn't stand outside of the car and just continue to talk 
to him about the fact that the car stopped running and needed gas.
  What we did is, we tried to get some gas to get the car out of the 
busy intersection because a lot of people were trying to get by. It 
would have been of no value for me to stand there and lecture him or 
talk about how horrible the situation was. We wanted to fix it.
  That is the same thing with the Affordable Care Act. There are some 
problems. I think it would be crazy for anybody to say there are not 
problems. The law has already been passed by Congress, signed by the 
President, and

[[Page H7201]]

upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States.
  We would be infinitely better off if we gave our time to repairing 
the problems that are there as opposed to standing in the intersection 
talking about how bad it is.

         OPENING DAY FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN CONNECTICUT

  (Mr. COURTNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was opening day for the 
Affordable Care Act in the State of Connecticut. Despite the hysterical 
predictions on the other side, where you would have thought the Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse would be riding through the streets of New 
London, Norwich, and Hartford, instead, the headlines this morning 
were:

       Enrollment better than expected on exchange's first day.

  Forty-five thousand people contacted the Connecticut exchange. 
Hundreds enrolled. They didn't wait until January to begin the process 
of getting health coverage.
  One of them was a lady named Elly Banos, 48 years old, who said she's 
been without coverage for a year and half due to a layoff. She's been 
holding her breath and ``thanking God every day that I don't get sick 
or get into a car accident.'' She was excited to learn that she could 
get good individual coverage for a month or qualify for the expanded 
Medicaid coverage.
  Another, Babz Ivy, said that she has gone to bed ``with a prayer on 
my lips, asking God to keep me healthy and in no need of medical 
attention.''
  ``Today was amazing,'' Ivy said. ``I felt so empowered and in control 
of my health.''
  The fact of the matter is these are the targets of the shutdown 
effort. It's not President Obama or Democrats in Congress. It's people 
like Elly Banos and Babz Ivy that we need to protect by keeping this 
government open and allowing people to get access to health care for 
the first time in American history.

  FUNDING FOR THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MUST BE 
                                 DENIED

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today, I sent a letter to Kathleen 
Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services, asking, in light of 
Judge Vinson's ruling in Florida 2 weeks ago today where a declaratory 
judgment was issued that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
is indeed unconstitutional, that further implementation of this act not 
go forward.
  In fact, Judge Vinson stated that officials of the executive branch 
will adhere to the law as declared by the court. As a result, the 
declaratory judgment is the functional equivalent of an injunction. 
There is no reason to conclude that this presumption should not apply 
here.
  Now, I believe the judge is correct, that the administration should 
not proceed with implementation, and I've asked the Secretary for 
clarification that that is indeed her position and will be her position 
going forward.
  Of course we do have debate and a vote on the continuing resolution 
to fund the United States Government for the next 7 months. It is my 
expectation that funding for provisions of enacting the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act will not be funded in the continuing 
resolution.
  The American people have made it very clear, and even recently the 
Florida ruling confirmed that the health care law is unconstitutional, 
and Congress must do its job to make sure funding for this legislation 
is denied.

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2011.
     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,
     Secretary of Health and Human Services,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Secretary Sebelius: I write to inquire of the 
     Department of Health and Human Services your response to and 
     specifically subsequent implementation decisions made by the 
     Department in the wake of Judge Vinson's ruling in The State 
     of Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human 
     Services. As you are well aware, the plaintiff sought 
     declaratory judgment that the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional as well as an 
     injunction against its enforcement.
       In his opinion, Judge Vinson relied on precedent in 
     Committee on Judiciary of U.S. House of Representatives v. 
     Miers to determine that when a court issues a declaratory 
     judgment against federal officials, the ``declaratory 
     judgment is the functional equivalent of an injunction.'' He 
     quoted a previous United States Court of Appeals decision 
     which further addressed his point, ``that officials of the 
     Executive Branch will adhere to the law as declared by the 
     court. As a result, the declaratory judgment is the 
     functional equivalent of an injunction . . . There is no 
     reason to conclude that this presumption should not apply 
     here. Thus, the award of declaratory relief is adequate and 
     separate injunctive relief is not necessary.''
       I would like to request information on how, in light of the 
     declaratory relief issued by Judge Vinson, the Department 
     plans to proceed in its implementation of the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act.
       Thank you for your time and consideration on this issue and 
     I look forward to your response. Should you have any 
     questions, please contact me in my Washington office at (202) 
     225-7772.
           Sincerely,
                                         Michael C. Burgess, M.D.,
     Member of Congress.

                  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUCCESS STORIES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, we have been in this huge debate around the 
Affordable Care Act for quite a while now. One of the things that I 
cannot ever forget is the health care nightmare stories that I listened 
to before we passed the Affordable Care Act. As I see so many of my 
Republican colleagues gleefully celebrate the difficulties with the Web 
site or cancelations and then think that that is going to somehow help 
them in an election, I can't think about any election. All I can think 
about are people like the people whom I want to share with you right 
now.
  Let me tell you about Marty Olson. Marty built a small business 
creating marble sinks and countertops. He poured everything he had into 
his business, and it flourished. He became a job creator, in the 
language of some people. I call him a ``small business person.'' I call 
his customers ``job creators.''
  Just a few years ago, he employed more than half a dozen employees. 
Recently, things changed drastically for him. Over the course of the 
last year, his 9-year-old daughter, Abby, was diagnosed with leukemia. 
She beat the odds and was in remission for 6 months until her cancer 
symptoms returned. She is now awaiting a bone marrow transplant. Mr. 
Olson spent time with his ailing daughter, and his business began to 
decrease.

                              {time}  1030

  He is now the sole employee of the marble business. Three months ago, 
he suffered a detached artery and had heart surgery. He is still 
recuperating from his surgery and losing his insurance on January 1 due 
to a divorce. He began to search for affordable health insurance, but 
most premium quotes were too much for him to afford. The implementation 
of the Affordable Care Act means he will not be denied insurance due to 
his preexisting heart condition. The health care exchange in Minnesota, 
mnsure.org, is allowing him to purchase a policy he can afford. Without 
the plans available on the Minnesota health care exchange, he likely 
would have to choose between health insurance or paying his other 
monthly bills.
  When his business was growing, he often trained employees who 
increased his production, but sometimes lost that employee because he 
was unable to provide them with an adequate health care insurance plan. 
The small business exchange is there for him to use when his business 
grows again in the future.
  Of course Marty is not by himself in this. Tracy Brock is another 
small business owner. She has presided over a small business for 21 
years. She is able to earn enough to support herself and hire several 
part-time employees. However, her health insurance premiums have forced 
her to work six to seven days a week. Those high premiums, around $650 
a month, prevent her from taking time to enjoy life and get some well-
deserved rest. Her insurance premiums were taking most of her marginal 
profits. The assets from her business disqualified her from receiving 
any assistance with her premiums.
  Tracy had the misfortune of being a cancer patient. She also needs 
knee replacement surgery, and Ms. Brock's business has not been as 
profitable recently so she continues to work every day despite her 
health condition. She began researching mnsure.org, the health care 
exchange available in Minnesota, and she found health plans with better 
coverage at prices that she can afford. Some plans she found were only 
50 percent of the cost of her current premium. The additional coverage 
will give her more options to treat her conditions, and the savings 
will allow her to work less and enjoy life more.
  I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't look at difficulties in 
the implementation of the Affordable Care Act as a political 
opportunity. We should never take our eye off the fact that we have 
citizens who desperately need something way better than we had before 
we had the Affordable Care Act. I wish Republicans would say, You know 
what, it is there. It is passed. The Supreme Court has said it is 
constitutional, and we are going to do everything we can to make it 
work even if we would do it different, and we will offer constructive 
improvements, but we are not going to sit back and just try to wreck it 
with poison pill bills like the Upton bill last week, or with the 47 
attempts to repeal it, or with the myriad of other tricks, sabotage, 
and devices that they have employed.
  It is time to help Americans like Marty Olson, like Tracy Brock, and 
like millions of other people, including

[[Page H7259]]

one of my own interns, Abby Schanfield. Abby is an awesome young woman. 
She has had numerous surgeries since she was 10 months old. Thanks to 
the Affordable Care Act, Abby is able to stay on her parents' insurance 
until she is 26, and her parents were able to pay premiums and copays 
that have given her access to the health care that she needs.
  So for that and for many other reasons, I urge support of the 
Affordable Care Act.

              THE 40TH VOTE TO REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANNA G. ESHOO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 2, 2013

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, there is something extraordinary taking 
place. Not only are we implementing the Affordable Care Act across 50 
states benefitting hundreds of millions of people in our country, but 
there is simultaneously an effort in the House of Representatives to 
repeal the law for the 40th time.
  Imagine. . .this is not the fourth time, but the 40th time that 
Republicans are moving to take away rights to which Americans are 
legally entitled. These are the rights signed into law by the President 
and confirmed by the United States Supreme Court.
  There's never been such an effort in Congress in the history of our 
country where a measure has been taken up 40 times. I believe my 
friends on the other side of the aisle are on the wrong side of 
history.
  I would like to highlight this phenomenon through the lens of 
constituents and the rights they have and the rights that my Republican 
colleagues want to take away from them.
  They want to reopen the prescription drug donut hole that was created 
through the program that they supported, costing seniors thousands of 
out-of-pocket expenses a year.
  They want to take away from children the ability to stay on their 
parents' insurance policy up to the age of 26.
  They want to take away lifetime limit caps on insurance policies. How 
can anyone argue that lifetime limit caps were ever good policy?
  They want to take away preventive services from Americans like 
mammograms and colonoscopies.
  They want to take away health care premiums that are actually spent 
on medical care instead of advertising.
  They want to take away the right to plain language explanations of 
plan benefits.
  And most of all, they want to take away the rights of my constituents 
to health insurance for those with preexisting conditions.
  Thomas Jefferson said in 1808 that ``great innovations should not be 
forced on slender majorities.'' I think an overwhelming number of 
American people would say they are in favor of the rights they have 
under the Affordable Care Act, versus going back to a time of 
discriminatory practices of private insurers.

     THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CONTINUES TO HURT PATIENTS AND DOCTORS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today The Dallas Morning News and the Fort 
Worth Star-Telegram carried stories that only 31 percent of Texas 
doctors are accepting new patients who rely on Medicaid. In 2010, the 
last time the survey was taken, it was 42 percent. In the year 2000, it 
was 67 percent.
  The Texas Medical Association conducted the survey and attributes the 
dropping numbers to a low reimbursement rate for physicians and 
increasing red tape. Doctors appear to be losing patience with 
government-funded health plans and government-run health care in 
general.
  You know, shortly after the Supreme Court decision, all of the cable 
talk shows talked about it's free riders that are driving up the cost 
of health care in this country. No, it's not. The biggest freeloader is 
the Federal Government.
  The Federal Government, with its Medicare and Medicaid programs being 
structured the way they are, is actually causing the cost of health 
care to skyrocket in this country, and that's something that needs to 
stop. They're freeloading on an underfunded program, and it's costing 
us money. And more importantly, it's inexcusably hurting patients.
  The Affordable Care Act is a bad law. We all knew it was bad law when 
it passed. It was written by lobbyists in secret down at the White 
House. It was a rough draft passed by the Senate that got forced to the 
House.
  This House is going to hold a repeal vote this week. I suspect it 
will pass. I urge the Senate to take up and pass this repeal vote so we 
can get on to the important business of reforming the system in this 
country.

                     AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND WOMEN

  (Ms. SLAUGHTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, I was really honored to 
serve as the chair of the House Committee on Rules and bring this 
historic Affordable Care Act to the House floor. It was one of my 
proudest moments. I'm standing here today, equally proud to defend that 
law from the ongoing war on women.
  When it comes to health care, women are classified as a preexisting 
condition. For decades, women have been routinely charged more for 
health insurance than a man who seeks the very same coverage.
  Did you know that if a business employs more women than men, it can 
choose to raise everybody's premiums, regardless of gender, to cover 
the higher cost, which is, in their mind, of insuring women?
  Women not only pay for standard insurance coverage, but they also pay 
a separate cost for maternity coverage. In Illinois, a 30-year-old 
woman must pay $278 a month and an additional $270 a month for 
maternity coverage in case she needs it.
  Insurance companies claim that these added costs are because women 
are more likely to visit doctors, get checkups, take prescription 
drugs, and have illnesses. Everyone knows that preventative care--
everyone but the insurance companies, apparently--saves us money in the 
long run. We women in the majority of the United States are tired of 
being second-class citizens.

              AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DESTROYS PATIENT ACCESS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to bring your attention to the 
front page of USA Today. The story is titled, ``Medicaid Payments Go 
Under the Knife.'' This is an issue that, unfortunately, is going to 
continue to get worse. Medicaid isn't just going under the knife; it's 
being slashed.
  The simple truth is that Medicaid has become a coverage without 
access and only an empty promise for the people who arguably may 
legitimately need its services. And the Affordable Care Act is only 
going to exacerbate the problem with patient access to physicians. The 
new health care law has changed what was a program that was designed 
for the poorest of the poor, pregnant women, children, and the elderly, 
and turned it into a one-size-fits-all government program. States will 
add 16 million new people to the program, millions of younger adults, 
putting an even greater strain on the State budgets.
  The health care law never addressed the root problem. We need to 
ensure that Medicaid spending is directed in a fashion that provides an 
actual safety net for those in need and allows States to create a range 
of products to give Medicaid patients access to their physicians and 
better care. We actually need to get back to the basics. And it is 
essential that we examine Medicaid and realize the ramifications before 
our States sink even deeper into a budgetary crisis.

 INTRODUCTION OF BILL TO REPEAL PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE 
                                  ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PAUL C. BROUN

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 18, 2011

  Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today, I am honored to introduce a 
bill that repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and 
the accompanying Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, 
and replaces it with four specific health care reform policies which 
will improve the challenges facing our country's health care financing.
  Americans desire true health care reform that lowers premium costs, 
meets their medical needs regardless of what job they currently have or 
which state they live in, strengthens the doctor-patient relationship, 
and provides an affordable approach for medical insurance coverage for 
those uninsured or with pre-existing medical conditions. Many Members 
in Congress have expressed support for the ideas listed above and for 
the following specific solutions to these issues:
  (1) Individuals should be afforded the same tax advantages that 
businesses have by being able to deduct their 100 percent of all of 
their health care expenses from their taxes, including insurance.
  (2) Strengthen and expand new avenues for affordable health care for 
sick Americans through high-risk pools.
  (3) Expand choice and competition by allowing consumers to shop for 
health insurance across state lines.
  (4) Create association health plans, which would allow small 
businesses and other entities to form pools that will increase 
availability and allow their sheer size to negotiate lower costs for 
their employees or members.
  While it's understood that these concepts do not make up a complete 
solution to our nation's health care financing problems, they would be 
a strong foundation to start to address the inequities inherent in the 
health care financing system, while still allowing for future 
additional reforms.

            AFFORDABLE CARE ACT--FISCAL CALAMITY IN WAITING

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, almost a month after the Supreme Court has 
issued its decision on the so-called Affordable Care Act, we have all 
had time to think and dissect their opinion and start to predict how 
this landmark ruling will affect each and every one of us.
  I respect the role of the Court and the decision of the Justices, but 
I can't help but tell you I was disappointed the entire law was upheld. 
I do believe the Affordable Care Act is detrimental to our Nation. 
Certainly it has been a wet blanket on our economy, and it is a real 
threat to the future of medicine in America. Since the passing of the 
law over 2 years ago, we have seen the strain it has placed on our 
economy. The pricetag continues to increase, sometimes staggeringly so. 
There are provisions which discourage small businesses from hiring, not 
to mention the commensurate government regulations.
  Today, the Congressional Health Care Caucus held a panel discussion 
on what was one of its many panel discussions on the current state of 
health care. Karen Ignagni, president and chief executive officer of 
America's Health Insurance Plans, has said that the health care law 
won't work unless it is changed or delayed. I couldn't agree more. Dan 
Danner from the National Federation of Independent Businesses was also 
present, and he said there has got to be a way to get price signals to 
people so they can participate in the cost of their care.
  The structure of this law, through the combination of new fees 
coupled with weak penalties for those who choose to not purchase will 
force the young and healthy to shoulder the majority of the financial 
burden of expansion. Mr. Speaker, we must do away with this thing.

[Pages H1396-H1397]
             THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is styled 
such for a reason. Let us look back to 2009, at the time we embarked 
upon passing the Affordable Care Act. At that time in 2009, we were 
spending $2.5 trillion per year on health care--$2.5 trillion. That is 
a lot of money, and it

[[Page H1397]]

is very difficult to understand $2.5 trillion. Well, $2.5 trillion is 
$79,000 per second. That's what we were spending on health care, 
$79,000 per second. I'll be quite candid with you: these numbers are so 
huge that sometimes I do confuse them myself. That's $79,000 per 
second.
  We were spending 17.6 percent of GDP on health care. It was projected 
that by 2018, we would be spending $4.4 trillion per year on health 
care. That would be $139,000 per second. As I said, big numbers. It's 
hard to always get them correct because they are so huge and they can 
be confusing. That's $139,000 per second.
  We had 45,000 persons per year dying because they didn't have proper 
health care. We had 21 million people who were working full time and 
did not have insurance. That is 21 million people. In my State of 
Texas, 6 million people were uninsured. Twenty percent of the State's 
children were uninsured. In Harris County in my State of Texas, 1.1 
million people were uninsured.
  It was time for this Congress to act, and act we did. By passing the 
Affordable Care Act, we have reduced the cost of health care over the 
long term. It doesn't happen immediately, because the rising cost, as 
I've explained to you, was exponentially huge. It was almost 
unimaginable. To bring it down doesn't mean it comes down instantly, 
but over the next 20 years we will save a trillion dollars.
  Here's what we've done. Aside from lowering the cost, which is 
important, we also impact lives. Preventive care is there. We also do 
away with preexisting conditions. For those who did not know, pregnancy 
is a preexisting condition. We also make sure that women are not 
discriminated against. Women won't be charged more simply because they 
are females, because they are women. We equalize health care as it 
relates to the genders. We close the doughnut hole as it relates to 
senior citizens. I might also add that in '09, we were spending about 
$100 billion a year on uninsured persons, much of that in emergency 
rooms where persons had to go to the emergency room to get the care 
that they did not have by virtue of not having insurance. They were 
getting their primary care in emergency rooms. They were also getting 
their pharmaceuticals through emergency rooms. It was a time to act, 
and act we did. We passed the Affordable Care Act.
  I will close with this. We live in the richest country in the world. 
One out of every 100 persons is a millionaire. In this country, if you 
are an enemy combatant and we should capture you and wound you in the 
process, we will give you aid and comfort. In this country, if you are 
a bank robber and you're robbing the bank and on the way out we should 
harm you, when we capture you, we will give you aid and comfort. In 
this country, if you're on death row and scheduled to meet your Maker 
next week and you get sick this week, we give you aid and comfort this 
week and we send you to meet your Maker next week. In this country, if 
we can give aid and comfort to the enemy combatant, if we can give aid 
and comfort to the criminal who robs the bank, if we can give aid and 
comfort to the person on death row, surely we can give aid and comfort 
to hardworking Americans who do not earn enough to afford insurance.
  The Affordable Care Act does this. It does not require people who 
cannot afford insurance to buy it, but it does say that every person 
who can should buy insurance.
  The Affordable Care Act is making a difference in the lives of 
people. Children can stay on their parents' policies until they're 26 
years of age. This was a good piece of legislation. I supported it then 
and I still support it now. The Affordable Care Act is affordable, and 
that is why we passed it.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Finally, my first elected job, many years ago, was to an 
organization called the Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. It was the 
largest hospital in the State. It was the largest hospital district. 
People ran at-large from Clark County, the Las Vegas area, and I was 
elected to that. It was my first elected job. When I took that job, 
there was no Medicare. In that hospital, when someone came who was old 
and did not have money, someone had to sign for them--a husband, a 
wife, father, mother, brother, sister, neighbor; someone signed. If 
that person did not pay after agreeing to pay, we had a large 
collection agency and we would go after those people. It was very 
difficult sometimes to collect that money, difficult in the sense it 
was hard to do, but, more importantly, it was difficult to do because 
you hated to go after people to pay these large hospital and doctor 
bills.
  Medicare came into being before I left my job. It changed. Prior to 
Medicare, 40 percent of the seniors who came into that hospital had no 
insurance, and that is where they had to look to their friends and 
neighbors and relatives to take care of that bill. Today, after 
Medicare is the law of the land, virtually every senior citizen has the 
ability to go into a hospital anyplace in America.
  For all of these many years, going on five decades, Medicare has been 
improving and extending the lives of seniors. The Affordable Care Act, 
legislation that my Republican colleagues tend to denigrate, 
Obamacare--let's talk a little bit about Obamacare today, the 
Affordable Care Act.
  One thing that bill did is it extended the life of Medicare for 12 
years. Medicare would stay strong for future generations and for 
retirees. That is one reason we passed that legislation.
  Health care reform today is helping seniors by beginning to close the 
doughnut hole, the infamous doughnut hole for prescription drugs for 
seniors. This year; that is, 2011, because of the legislation we 
passed, Obamacare, more than 2.5 million Medicare recipients, including 
thousands of Nevadans, saved about $600 each on prescription drugs. 
That amounts to about $1.6 billion, thanks to this legislation. For 
some seniors on fixed incomes, those savings prevented difficult 
choices between literally food and medicine.
  We also had a provision in that legislation that people could get 
wellness checks, screenings, and a checkup. More than 24 million 
seniors this year got free physicals because of health care reform. 
That is progress of which America can be proud.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, the Supreme Court concluded 
three days of oral arguments about the affordable care act, the law 
Congress passed 2 years ago to provide millions of Americans with 
access to affordable health care while bringing the spiraling costs in 
this area under control.
  I was fortunate to be able to attend yesterday's argument about the 
constitutionality of the provision requiring individuals to take 
personal responsibility for paying for their health care, and to watch 
in person and in real time. Hundreds of thousands of Vermonters and 
millions of Americans across the country who benefit from the 
affordable care act did not have that access. The Supreme Court's 
decision in this landmark case will affect every American. I think 
every American should have had a chance to see it and the Supreme Court 
should open its proceedings to television and radio.
  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of 
insurance reform. Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions 
are starting to receive help when trapped within a coverage gap known 
as the ``doughnut hole.'' The affordable care act completely closes the 
coverage gap by 2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to 
afford prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7,000 
Vermonters received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their 
prescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year, nearly 
6,800 Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their 
covered brandname prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of 
$714 per person. Since the affordable care act was signed into law, 
more than 4,000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance 
coverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their 
parents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are 
seeing in Vermont go on and on: 81,649 Vermonters on Medicare and more 
than 100,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and 
received preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay. 
These are just a few of the dozens of consumer protections included in 
the law that are benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day.
  Now that the law is in effect, many of the essential 
antidiscrimination and consumer protections of the affordable care act 
are being implemented, allowing consumers to take control of their own 
health care decisions. Going forward, insurance plans can no longer 
deny children coverage because of a preexisting health condition; 
insurance plans are barred from dropping beneficiaries from coverage 
simply because of an illness; dozens of preventative care services must 
be covered at no cost and with no copay; and Americans will have access 
to an easier appeals process for private medical claims that are 
denied.
  I attended Tuesday's argument with Senator Grassley, the ranking 
member of the Judiciary Committee. He and I disagreed about the 
affordable care act when we debated it extensively in the Senate and 
passed it 2 years ago. But we both respect the important role the Court 
plays in our constitutional system. I hope that as the Supreme Court 
considers its decision in the coming weeks, it respects the important 
role of Congress, the elected representatives of the American people.
  For years, we have heard Republican and Democratic Senators 
rightfully say that judges should not make law from the bench. For the 
sake of the health and security of our nation, the Supreme Court should 
not cast aside this landmark law and Congress' time-honored ability to 
protect the American people.
  After watching the arguments and following the debate closely, it is 
as clear to me now as it was when Congress debated and passed the law 
more than 2 years ago. The Supreme Court should uphold the affordable 
care act. Looking at Article I of the Constitution and a long line of 
Supreme Court precedents dating back to the Nation's earliest days, 
there is no question Congress acted well within its time-honored 
ability to protect the American people.
  Every Member of Congress takes an oath of office to ``support and 
defend the Constitution of the United States.'' We take this oath 
seriously. As Justice Scalia said at a Judiciary Committee hearing last 
year, we take the same oath that the Justices take.
  During the course of Congress' extensive consideration of the 
affordable care act, we considered untold numbers of amendments in 
committees and before the Senate. That is what Congress is supposed to 
do. We consider legislation, debate it, vote on it, and act in our best 
judgment to promote the general welfare. Some Senators agreed and some 
disagreed, but this was a matter decided by the democratically elected 
Congress.
  Among the arguments expressly considered and rejected by Congress 
before passing the affordable care act were arguments that the law was 
not constitutional. We considered and rejected arguments that the part 
of the law now being challenged in the Court--the individual mandate--
is not constitutional. In fact, those arguments were considered on the 
Senate floor when Senator Hatch raised and the Senate formally rejected 
a constitutional point of order claiming that the individual 
responsibility requirement was unconstitutional. During the Senate 
debate on the affordable care act, I responded, publicly and on the 
record, to arguments about the constitutionality of this requirement. 
No Justice could say Congress did not consider the constitutionality of 
the affordable care act.
  The individual mandate is about personal responsibility. Throwing out 
this requirement that Americans be responsible for their necessary 
health care costs will result in tossing aside the provision that bans 
insurance companies from denying Americans coverage based on pre-
existing conditions. The personal responsibility requirement is 
necessary to ensure that Americans who do have health insurance are not 
stuck with paying the $43 billion in health care costs incurred by 
millions of Americans who do not buy health insurance, instead relying 
on expensive emergency health care when inevitably faced with medical 
problems. Congress concluded this after extensive study and debate.
  I joined with congressional leaders in filing an amicus brief 
defending the affordable care act in the case now being considered by 
the Court because I am convinced that Congress acted well within the 
limits of the Constitution in acting to secure affordable health care 
for all Americans. I believe we must defend the enumerated powers given 
to Congress by the Constitution so that our ability to help protect 
hardworking American workers, families and consumers is not wrongly 
curtailed by the courts.
  Partisan opponents of the affordable care act want judges to override 
these legislative decisions properly made by Congress, the elected 
representatives of the American people. They want to challenge the 
wisdom understood by generations of Supreme Court justices from the 
great Chief Justice John Marshall in upholding the constitutionality of 
the national bank nearly 200 years ago to Justice Cardozo in finding 
Social Security constitutional early in the last century.
  The difference between the role of Congress and of the courts is not 
a partisan one or a controversial one. In his opinion upholding the 
affordable care act, Jeffrey Sutton, a conservative, President George 
W. Bush's appointee to the Sixth Circuit, understood the importance of 
courts not substituting

[[Page S2161]]

their policy preferences for those of Congress. He wrote: ``Time 
assuredly will bring to light the policy strengths and weaknesses of 
using the individual mandate as part of this national legislation, 
allowing the peoples' political representatives, rather than their 
judges, to have the primary say over its utility.''
  Professor Charles Fried, who was Solicitor General under President 
Reagan, testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a year ago on 
the constitutionality of the affordable care act. When Senator Grassley 
asked him if there needs to be changes to the part of the law requiring 
that individuals purchase health insurance to make it constitutional, 
Professor Fried answered: ``I see no need for it because it seems so 
clearly constitutional.'' I agree with him and I do not think it is a 
close call.
  The provisions of the affordable care act are firmly rooted in what 
previous Congresses enacted over the last century to protect hard-
working Americans. Working Americans have long been required to pay for 
Social Security and Medicare by the deduction of taxes reflected on 
their paychecks every month. It is not novel for Congress to pass laws 
affecting a health care market that makes up one-sixth of the U.S. 
economy, the key to satisfying the test for constitutionality under the 
Commerce Clause.
  What is telling about the partisan nature of these challenges is that 
many of those who now claim that the requirement that Americans have 
health insurance or face a tax penalty is unconstitutional are the very 
ones who proposed it. Republican Senators such as Orrin Hatch, the 
former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and John McCain proposed 
and supported a health insurance requirement when President Clinton was 
trying to increase access to health care. They proposed the individual 
mandate as an alternative when they opposed President Clinton's plan. 
This requirement was also a part of health care reform in Massachusetts 
supported by former Governor Mitt Romney and by Scott Brown, now a 
Republican Senator from Massachusetts.
  All of these opponents were for ensuring personal responsibility with 
an individual mandate until President Obama was for it, and now they 
are against it. Their views may have changed, but the Constitution has 
not.
  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the 
conclusion of my remarks a March 24 column in The Washington Post by 
Ezra Klein, ``Why Ryancare and Obamacare look so similar,'' questioning 
Republican opposition to the individual mandate they once championed.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  (See exhibit 1.)
  Mr. LEAHY. When I hear partisan critics attacking the affordable care 
act, I wonder what law they are looking at. The affordable care act 
will protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. The law eliminates 
discriminatory practices by health insurers, ensuring that a patient's 
gender is no longer a pre-existing condition, reduces the cost of 
prescription drugs for our Nation's senior citizens, and helps parents 
continue to cover their kids on their health insurance until they are 
26. The law also provides necessary resources to help law enforcement 
recover millions of taxpayer dollars lost to fraud and abuse in the 
health care system.
  If the Supreme Court overturns the affordable care act now, it will 
be devastating to kids, families, and senior citizens. I hope the Court 
does not undo the progress we have made. Doing so depends on legal 
theories so extreme they would turn back the clock even farther to the 
hardships of the Great Depression and strike down principles that have 
helped us build the social safety net over the last century with Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
  The affordable care act builds on some of the cornerstones of 
American economic security built over the last century. I believed when 
it passed, and still believe today, that Congress acted within its 
constitutional authority to enact laws to help protect all Americans, I 
hope the Court does not overstep the judiciary's role by substituting 
its own policy preferences and denying a century of progress.

                               Exhibit 1

               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2012]

               Why Ryancare and Obamacare Look so Similar

                            (By Ezra Klein)

       Let's play a game. I'll describe a health-care bill to you. 
     Then you tell me if I'm describing President Obama's 
     Affordable Care Act or the budget released this week by Rep. 
     Paul Ryan (R Wis.).
       The bill works like this: The federal government subsidizes 
     Americans to participate in health insurance markets known as 
     ``exchanges.'' Inside these exchanges, insurers can't 
     discriminate based on pre-existing conditions. Individuals 
     can choose to go without insurance, but if they do so, they 
     pay a penalty. To keep premium costs down, the government 
     ties the size of the subsidy to the second-least-expensive 
     plan in the market--a process known as ``competitive 
     bidding,'' which encourages consumers to choose cheaper 
     plans.
       This is, of course, a trick question. That paragraph 
     describes both the Affordable Care Act and Ryan's proposed 
     Medicare reforms. The insurance markets in both plans are 
     essentially identical. And for good reason.
       The Affordable Care Act was based on two decades of 
     Republican thinking about health care. The basic structure 
     was first proposed by the conservative Heritage Foundation in 
     1989, first written into a bill by Senate Republicans in 
     1993, and first passed into law by a Republican governor by 
     the name of Mitt Romney in 2005.
       About 2008, Democrats decided they could live with a system 
     based on private health insurers, federal subsidies and an 
     individual mandate as long as it produced universal coverage. 
     A year later, Republicans decided they couldn't live with 
     such a system, at least not if a Democratic president was 
     proposing it.
       The problem for the Republicans, however, is that they 
     don't have a better--or even alternative--idea. Since the 
     passage of the Affordable Care Act, ``repeal and replace'' 
     has been a reliable applause line at tea party rallies and an 
     oft-uttered incantation on the floor of the House of 
     Representatives. But while Republicans have united around 
     ``repeal'' of health-care reform, they haven't managed to 
     come up with a policy for ``replace.''
       Instead, they've opted to apply their old policy 
     framework--the one the Democrats stole--to Medicare. That has 
     left the two parties in a somewhat odd position: Democrats 
     support the Republicans' old idea for the under-65 set but 
     oppose it for the over-65 set. Republicans support the 
     Democrats' new idea for the over-65 set but oppose it for the 
     under-65 set.
       This isn't quite as incoherent as it seems. Democrats say 
     they would prefer Medicare-for-All for the under-65 set, but 
     they'll take whatever steps toward universal health insurance 
     they can get. Republicans say they would prefer a more free-
     market approach for the over-65 set but that a seniors' 
     version of ``Obamacare'' is nevertheless a step in the right 
     direction. For both parties, it's the direction of the 
     policy, rather than the policy itself, that matters.
       There's an added complication for Republicans. They have 
     assumed huge savings from applying the exchange-and-subsidies 
     model to Medicare. But they don't assume--in fact they 
     vehemently deny--that those same savings would result from 
     the identical policy mechanism in the Affordable Care Act. 
     The Democrats haven't assumed significant savings from the 
     exchange-and-subsidies model in either case.
       If the concept works as well as Ryan says it will, then the 
     Affordable Care Act will cost far, far less than is currently 
     projected. There's no compelling reason to believe 
     competitive bidding will cuts costs for seniors but fail 
     among younger, healthier consumers who, if anything, are in a 
     better position to change plans every few years and therefore 
     pressure insurers to cut costs.
       The discrepancy highlights another difference between 
     Republicans and Democrats right now. Republicans have put all 
     their eggs in the competitive-bidding basket. If that doesn't 
     work to control costs--and versions of it have failed in the 
     past--they're sunk.
       Democrats, on the other hand, are promoting a slew of 
     delivery-system reforms in the Affordable Care Act. They're 
     hoping competitive bidding works, but they're also trying 
     comparative-effectiveness review, pay-for-quality, 
     accountable-care organizations, electronic health records, 
     penalties for excessive readmissions and medical errors, and 
     a host of other experiments to determine which treatments and 
     processes actually work and how to reward the doctors and 
     hospitals that adopt them.
       It's unlikely that the model in the Republican budget will 
     prove sustainable. That legislation would repeal the 
     Affordable Care Act, cut Medicaid by a third and adopt 
     competitive bidding for Medicare. The likely result? The 
     nation's uninsured population would soar. In the long run, 
     and quite possibly in the short run, that will increase the 
     pressure for a universal system. Because Republicans don't 
     really have an idea for creating one, Democrats will step 
     into the void.
       As a result, Republicans' long-term interests are probably 
     best served by Democratic success. If the Affordable Care Act 
     is repealed by the next president or rejected by the Supreme 
     Court, Democrats will probably retrench, pursuing a strategy 
     to expand Medicare and Medicaid on the way toward a single-
     payer system. That approach has, for

[[Page S2162]]

     them, two advantages that will loom quite large after the 
     experience of the Affordable Care Act: It can be passed with 
     51 votes in the Senate through the budget reconciliation 
     process, and it's indisputably constitutional.
       Conversely, if the Affordable Care Act not only survives 
     but also succeeds, then Republicans have a good chance of 
     exporting its private-insurers-and-exchanges model to 
     Medicare and Medicaid, which would entrench the private 
     health-insurance system in America.
       That's not the strategy Republicans are pursuing. Instead, 
     they're stuck fighting a war against a plan that they helped 
     to conceive and, on a philosophical level, still believe in. 
     No one has been more confounded by this turn of events than 
     Alice Rivlin, the former White House budget director who 
     supports the Affordable Care Act and helped Ryan design an 
     early version of his Medicare premium-support proposal.
       ``I could never understand why Ryan didn't support the 
     exchanges in the Affordable Care Act,'' Rivlin says. ``In 
     fact, I think he does, and he just doesn't want to say so.''

                     AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ENROLLMENT

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I stand here first to salute those who 
advocate against domestic violence and those who advocate for more 
stroke awareness--health care issues.
  I also stand here not only as a Member of Congress, but as a person 
who has navigated the online health care insurance marketplace system, 
so let me note some facts.
  Yes, there have been problems. Unfortunately, the Web site was not 
prepared to handle the huge volume of interest, but President Obama has 
made it clear that the delays on the Web site are unacceptable and they 
will be fixed.
  Since the marketplace has opened, healthcare.gov has had over 20 
million unique visitors. And while the site is being improved, 
consumers should keep in mind what we haven't heard from my colleagues, 
that there are four ways they can apply for coverage: by phone, online, 
by mail with a paper application, or with the help of an in-person 
assistant.
  I say to you, let us not forget the point that millions of Americans 
are now able to choose an insurance plan that will make the most sense 
for them and for their family.

  (Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I received an 
email from a woman who runs a small business in my district. I will 
read it to you now:

       Morgan, As you know, I'm a small business with 36 
     employees, have been paying 75 percent of my employees' 
     health care for over 20 years.
       Get a call from health care provider agent that although my 
     renewal date is March 1, the companies are offering to renew 
     on December 1 this year with a 9.8 percent increase. This is 
     to beat what is anticipated as a 30 to 60 percent increase 
     after all the effects of ObamaCare.
       Needless to say, this has reignited my frustration with the 
     so-called Affordable Health Care Act. Please stick to your 
     principles, continue the fight. Let me know what, if 
     anything, I can do.

  Yes, ma'am, I will.

   THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE IMPACT ON THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Mrs. Christensen) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, Tuesday was a bittersweet day. It was 
an unfortunate day because of the government shutdown, but it was a 
good day because of the millions of Americans who live in the States 
and Washington D.C., who finally had the opportunity to leave the ranks 
of the uninsured when they logged in or called the toll-free number and 
enrolled in affordable quality health care coverage through the health 
insurance marketplaces.
  However, October 1 was bittersweet for other reasons for me, and I 
rise today as a Congresswoman from the United States Virgin Islands 
because on October 1 my constituents, who are also Americans, were 
largely left out in the cold on this key part of the law.
  As a member of the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, I was 
at the table and an active participant in the drafting, negotiation, 
and

[[Page H6184]]

amending of the Affordable Care Act, and I am proud that I was. But it 
was and remains sadly clear that one of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the 
other territories' biggest public health and health care challenges 
when it comes to Federal policies is benign neglect. Despite our 
efforts, still too many people, well intentioned, just don't 
acknowledge that, for example, across nearly every health indicator, 
from HIV/AIDS, cancer, heart disease and obesity prevalence, to rates 
of uninsurance and health care provider shortages, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands often are worse off than the national average.
  So I, working in close collaboration with leadership and my 
territorial colleagues, the Black, Hispanic, Asian and Progressive 
Caucuses, worked tirelessly to ensure that the more than 4 million 
Americans who live in U.S. territories, as well as our collective 
health care systems, would enjoy the positive benefits of health care 
reform.
  The great news is that we were in very large part successful. Today, 
Virgin Islanders and other persons in the territories are included in 
the consumer protections that make it illegal for a health plan to deny 
health coverage because of a preexisting disease or to rescind or deny 
coverage when someone gets sick and to impose lifetime dollar limits on 
essential benefits.
  Today, U.S. Virgin Islanders can keep their children on their health 
plans until the child is 26 years of age. Because of The Affordable 
Care Act, today seniors in the U.S. Virgin Islands receive free annual 
wellness visits and free preventive care. They receive Medicare 
prescription drug rebate checks and meaningful help covering the cost 
of their prescription drugs. In the U.S. Virgin Islands because of the 
Affordable Care Act, our community health centers and community health 
workers are strengthened and better equipped to serve as medical homes.
  But the devil is in the details. You see, the sad reality is that 
just because U.S. Virgin Islanders are included in the law and eligible 
for these great benefits does not mean that the law has been 
implemented in a manner that allows them all benefits or to fully 
experience the positive impact the Affordable Care Act was intended to 
have on every American.
  The law gave the Governor in the U.S. Virgin Islands a choice between 
two options, and all the territories: one, to establish a health 
insurance exchange, either separately or in partnership with a State 
that was also setting up a State-based exchange; or, two, to use the 
funds that would have gone towards the exchange to expand our Medicaid 
program.
  The Governor, based on advice of a task force and consultants, opted 
for option number two. And so amid all of the information that is being 
promulgated about the opening up of enrollment for the exchanges, 
wonderful news for many Americans, my constituents and those in the 
other territories feel very much left out and unfairly treated. To add 
insult to injury, there are no individual policies being written and 
the industry is blaming it, I think unfairly and not rightly, on the 
Affordable Care Act.
  It is important to remember that because of the Affordable Care Act 
there is a very significant increase, though in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars, in funding for the Medicaid program and the 
Governor can establish a local poverty level that could significantly 
increase Medicaid eligibility. The robust increase in funding for 
Medicaid can allow for thousands of Virgin Islanders to be newly 
eligible for meaningful health insurance coverage under that program. 
Unfortunately, although the House passed a provision that would have 
changed the match, it did not make it through the Senate, so the match 
is set so high that it is difficult for us and the other territories to 
fully utilize the increased funding.
  As a physician who practiced for more than 20 years before coming to 
Congress, I know what happens to someone's health and wellness, as well 
as personal finances, when they do not have health insurance coverage. 
It is catastrophic. That is why I requested meetings with Secretary 
Sebelius to explore how and whether the moneys that could have been 
used to establish a health insurance exchange can instead be used for 
making health care reform a reality for those who are uninsured but 
make too much to qualify for Medicaid.
  So there is a small but distinct window of opportunity to work with 
the Secretary and our Governor to think outside the box, to identify 
meaningful and thoughtful solutions to the unique health care 
challenges facing the Americans in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some will 
require legislation, and I ask for the support of my colleagues on 
that; but also please let us pass a clean CR to keep our government 
open and provide services to Americans wherever we live in this great 
country.

                           HON. DEREK KILMER

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 18, 2013

  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, as Congress considers two pieces of 
legislation related to the Affordable Care Act, I rise today to point 
out the silly exercise we're going through. On days like today, the 
American public gets to see exactly why Congress' approval rating is at 
historic lows.
   Today, we're voting on two bills that would amend provisions of the 
Affordable Care Act. The first bill before us, H.R. 2667, would delay 
the so-called employer mandate provision until January 1, 2015. Given 
that the Administration has already said that they are delaying the 
employer mandate provision until that time, this bill won't actually do 
anything.
   Mr. Speaker, the other bill we're voting on, H.R. 2668, would delay 
the implementation of the so-called individual mandate for one year. 
This bill would severely undermine the integrity of the Affordable Care 
Act. While I wasn't in Congress when the Affordable Care Act was passed 
into law, it is clear that this provision is needed to help make 
insurance affordable for all Americans and finally end the ability for 
insurance companies to deny coverage to those who have pre-existing 
conditions. By delaying the individual mandate, this bill would raise 
premiums on working class families and cause significant harm to our 
efforts to make health insurance accessible to all Americans.
   I am proud of the work the State of Washington has done, through its 
state-based exchange and Medicaid expansion efforts, to make health 
insurance accessible for more than half a million uninsured 
Washingtonians. This will not only lead to a healthier population, but 
save Washington State an estimated $280 million by the end of 2015, and 
add 10,000 new jobs as a result of the coming health care changes.
   Before today's vote, I reached out to Washington State's Office of 
the Insurance Commissioner to discuss the individual insurance 
marketplace and the proposal to delay the individual mandate. I was 
assured that the marketplace is moving forward, full steam ahead. 
Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler said in a statement, ``Delaying 
the mandate would be unwise. It's an issue of personal responsibility. 
It's unfair for people who can afford coverage to not have it, and to 
expect the rest of us to cover the cost of their care if they become 
seriously sick or injured.''
   The decision to bring both of these bills to the floor in this 
manner is not guided by some public policy concern. It is not to put 
forward credible solutions to legitimate problems. It is nothing more 
than a cynical attempt to play politics and mock the notion that we 
should implement the Affordable Care Act in a thoughtful, pragmatic 
way.
   Mr. Speaker, I reject this false dichotomy. I support H.R. 2667, the 
Authority for Mandate Delay Act, not because I believe it solves an 
urgent problem, but for the same reason that I supported the 
Administration when they made this decision in the first place: the 
provisions have been determined to be too complex to implement prior to 
the existing deadline. I've met with several dozen employers in recent 
months who have asked for more time and greater certainty. That's what 
this bill does.
   On the other hand, I oppose H.R. 2668, the Fairness for American 
Families Act, because the individual marketplace is moving forward and 
is in a fundamentally different place. In fact, this bill would 
severely undermine our ability to provide affordable, comprehensive 
health insurance to Americans.

[From the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commisioner Updates, 
                             July 17, 2013]

       ``Delaying the mandate would be unwise. This is an issue of 
     personal responsibility. It's unfair for people who can 
     afford coverage to not have it, and to expect the rest of us 
     to cover the cost of their care if they become seriously sick 
     or injured.
       ``A critical part of the Affordable Care Act was the 
     provision requiring that insurers take all applicants. No 
     more screening out people because they have pre-existing 
     medical conditions. But to make that work, you have to have 
     as many people as possible in the insurance pool.
       ``Without an individual mandate to have coverage, people 
     would likely just buy insurance when they knew they needed 
     it. That's like letting people get homeowners insurance only 
     when their house catches fire.''

               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, 38 times? How many times will we vote to 
repeal or take away patient protection from families and to undermine 
the middle class? It makes no sense.
  Look at what we know:
  The United States Supreme Court said the PPACA is constitutional;
  Millions have already benefited;
  One hundred million cannot have lifetime limits placed upon their 
health care;
  By January 2014, 129 million cannot be denied coverage due to a 
preexisting condition;
  By 2020, there will be no doughnut hole, and already 6.3 million 
seniors save $6.1 billion on prescription drugs;
  Women cannot be discriminated against by 2014; last year alone, 90 
percent of the best-selling plans still charged women more; and
  Seventeen million children are now protected from being denied 
coverage due to a preexisting condition.
  Mr. Speaker, really, 38 times? Why? It makes no common sense.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you another letter I 
received from a constituent about the Affordable Care Act. He writes:

       About 9 months ago, my wife was forced to leave her job, in 
     part because they wanted her to travel to Boston twice a week 
     and the responsibilities to care for our daughter who has 
     cerebral palsy made that impossible. Our health insurance was 
     from her employment.
       We went on to COBRA, which cost about $1,400 per month. 
     Waiting to have permanent insurance that did not have a 
     termination date, we contacted Anthem Blue Cross for a quote 
     for private insurance.
       We were told that my wife was uninsurable for 10 years 
     because she had been treated for depression a few years ago 
     when our daughter was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and we 
     were told she would require spinal cord surgery to possibly 
     walk.
       They then said, because of her condition, the cost for only 
     my daughter and I was almost $4,000 per month. The burden for 
     the last 6 months was overwhelming. Insurance brokers 
     informed us that only the Affordable Health Care Act could 
     help us.
       Yesterday my wife signed up for health insurance for all of 
     us. Due to our income, we do not qualify for assistance and 
     we were never looking for any. All we wanted was affordable 
     insurance for my family. The policy we selected will end up 
     costing about what our COBRA payment is, $1,400, depending on 
     how much deductible we end up using, which is all we ever 
     wanted.
       I know the only reason our family is safe is because of the 
     President, who cares more about people like us than the CEO 
     of Anthem Blue Cross or Aetna.

  Mr. Speaker, I receive calls and letters like this all the time. It 
is why I worked so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act in the first 
place.
  This is a transformative piece of legislation, a law that provides 
more security for the middle class and a better, healthy quality of 
life for the entire community. It empowers patients and doctors again 
and puts them, and not insurers, back at the center of care. It makes 
important, long-overdue reforms that most people just take as common 
sense.
  But for 3 years now, this House Republican majority has been trying 
to roll the clock back and bring back the bad old days when insurance 
companies could discriminate against people with preexisting 
conditions, even children with preexisting conditions, once again. They 
want to see women pay more for the same coverage than men, be denied 
coverage because they survived breast cancer, were a victim of domestic 
violence, or had a child by cesarean section. They want to see small 
businesses lose tax credits and seniors' health care and drug costs 
continue to rise at staggering rates.
  But we are not going to go back. The Affordable Care Act is already 
making a profound difference for individuals and families in need. It 
is time to stop with the partisan political games and let it work for 
families who desperately need to have health care coverage and 
insurance that they can't afford.

                          ____________________

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, tomorrow we celebrate the second 
anniversary of the signing of the affordable care act into law. Our 
Democratic leader, Senator Reid, in his opening remarks today, outlined 
the tremendous progress we have made. I listened to the comments made 
by our distinguished Republican leader, and all I heard was: Repeal 
ObamaCare, repeal ObamaCare.
  But I never heard what they want to replace it with. They just want 
to go back to the old system where the insurance companies ran 
everything before, where people were thrown off their policies because 
they had an illness, where because of preexisting conditions people 
could not get health care coverage, where we had this big doughnut hole 
which we are now closing for the elderly?
  The one aspect I want to focus on this morning in my brief time is an 
extraordinary element of the affordable care act that is not being 
talked about a lot but which members of the committee I now am 
privileged to chair, the HELP Committee, worked so hard to include in 
the affordable care act; that is, the array of provisions that promote 
wellness, disease prevention, and public health.
  Taken together, these provisions have begun to jump-start America's 
transformation into a genuine wellness society. They are transforming 
our current sick care system into a true health care system. I have 
said this many times: We do not have a health care system in America. 
We have a sick

[[Page S1958]]

care system. If people get sick, they get care--one way or the other. 
But there is very little out there to help people keep healthy and to 
maintain wellness and to keep them from going to the hospital in the 
first place. Now, that would be a true health care system, and that is 
what we have begun to establish with the affordable care act, by 
preventing chronic diseases, enabling people to stay healthy, and stay 
out of hospitals in the first place.
  Right now in the United States about 75 percent of all our health 
care spending--75 percent of the Nation's health care spending--is on 
chronic diseases. Only 4 percent is spent for prevention. So during the 
last year we have data for--2005--the United States spent about $2 
trillion on health care. Of every $1 spent, 75 cents went toward 
treating patients with chronic diseases, many of which are preventable. 
Only 4 cents went toward prevention. That ought to tell us something 
right there. That is the old system, and that is the system the 
Republicans want us to go back to: Spending more and more to treat 
people after they get sick rather than trying to put something forward 
to keep people healthy.
  Well, in the affordable care act we have tremendous opportunities to 
again move us to more prevention and wellness. We have made 
historically new investments in this area of wellness, prevention, and 
public health. Here is one example of that, as shown on this chart.
  Before our health care reform bill, our law, was passed, just take 
the issue of colorectal cancer screening; we know, if people get it 
early and detect it early, their chances of survival are tremendous. If 
people detect it too late, then they are going to be in the hospital, 
and they are going to have cancer, they are not going to live. But we 
know, by people getting a colorectal cancer screening early, we can 
prevent a lot of unnecessary deaths and illnesses and treatments later 
on.
  Cholesterol screening: We know if people get good cholesterol 
screening, they can get on either a drug or a good diet, an exercise 
program, reducing the prevalence of heart disease.
  Tobacco cessation: Need we keep repeating around here how much it 
costs our society from the plague of tobacco use?
  Well, here is where we were before health care reform, as shown on 
this chart. About 68 percent were covered for colorectal cancer 
screenings, about 57 percent were covered for cholesterol screenings, 
and only 4 percent were covered for tobacco cessation.
  After health care reform, now there is 100 percent--100 percent--
coverage for colorectal screenings with no copays and deductibles, I 
might add; 100 percent coverage for cholesterol screenings, and 100 
percent coverage for tobacco cessation.
  That is prevention, that is wellness, keeping people healthy in the 
first place. What do the Republicans want? They want to go back to what 
it was. We have made too much progress in prevention and wellness to go 
back to the old ways of just treating people after they get sick.
  Now, again, we have been able to promote a lot of activities around 
the country to promote health and wellness. For example, in Illinois, 
the State made improvements to its sidewalks and marked crossings to 
increase student physical activity levels. You might say: Well, big 
deal.
  Well, it is a big deal. Because of these improvements, the number of 
students who are walking to school has doubled--doubled--and it is 
expected to save the school system about $67,000 a year just on bus 
costs. So kids are healthier and we save money.
  In Alabama, Mobile County is using funds from this prevention fund to 
support tobacco quit lines to help residents live tobacco free--again, 
under the Tobacco Cessation Program.
  Officials enacted a comprehensive smoke-free policy expected to 
protect 13,000 of their residents--this is in Mobile County, AL--from 
being exposed to secondhand smoke. All across America, more and more is 
being invested in prevention. We know that, for example, a 5-percent 
reduction in the obesity rate--just a 5-percent reduction in the 
obesity rate--will yield more than $600 billion in savings on health 
care costs over 20 years.
  Again, our prevention fund is out there getting people the necessary 
support and information they need to reduce obesity. So with the 
misguided efforts to repeal the health care reform law, again, most 
Americans know what is at stake. They are going to lose a lot of these 
prevention activities that enable us to take charge of our own health 
care to make sure we get our colonoscopies on time, our mammogram 
screenings.
  Every woman in America now over age 40 gets a free mammogram 
screening--no copays, no deductibles. The Republicans want to take that 
away from the women of this country. Colonoscopies, as I said, without 
copays or deductibles, Republicans want to take that away. Annual 
physicals. We know a lot of people do not get annual physicals because 
it costs money. It costs them. Now they can get an annual physical 
free--no copays, no deductibles. Republicans want to take that away.
  Again, I think we have to ask the question--every time I hear the 
Republicans talking about doing away with ObamaCare or the affordable 
care act, we have to ask: Are we going to cut short this transformation 
into a wellness society in preventing diseases, keeping people healthy 
in the first place? I think the answer is clear. Americans are not 
going to allow all these hard-earned protections and benefits in the 
affordable care act to be a taken away. We are not going to be dragged 
backward. We are going to continue our march forward to make ourselves 
more healthy. We are not going back to the old system, where only a 
little over half the people in this country got cholesterol screening, 
68 percent got colorectal cancer screening.
  We want people to get early screening, early support services for 
preventive care so they stay healthy. Not only is it going to help our 
family budgets, it is going to help our Federal budget if we have 
people healthier and not going to the hospital in the first place. This 
is one of the big aspects of the affordable care act that is not talked 
about a lot. But to me it is one of the most important aspects of 
moving us, again, to a society where we are not just relying on people 
going to the hospital and paying for high hospital bills and things 
such as that in the future.
  I am going to yield the floor. I just wanted to make those comments 
about one aspect of the affordable care act. Of course, we do know 
there are many other benefits in the affordable care act people do not 
want to lose. Right now, we ban lifetime limits, which helps more than 
100 million people. They want to take that away. Republicans want to 
take that away. We cover vital preventive services, which I just went 
over; young people remaining on their parents' coverage up to age 26--
more than 2.5 million helped so far. Republicans want to take that 
away. They want to end all that. I do not think the American people 
want to end it. I think the American people want to move forward with 
health care reform because we have made too much progress--too much 
progress in making sure health insurance is affordable, available.
  I guess I have just one more thing to say, if my friend from Rhode 
Island will let me.
  Everyone in this Senate body belongs to the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits Program. Do you know what. We have coverage for preexisting 
conditions. We have no lifetime bans in our policies. Yet that is what 
we did. Remember the debate? We wanted to say to the American people: 
Whatever we have, we want you to have too. We put that in the 
affordable care act.
  The Republicans say: We are going to take that away from the American 
people but keep it for ourselves. I do not think so. I do not think so. 
I do not think the American people want to say: You Senators and you 
Congressmen can keep all that, but you can take it away from all of us. 
We are not going to do it. We are not going to go backward.
  I yield the floor for my distinguished friend from Rhode Island who 
played such a pivotal role in getting the affordable care act through 
on our committee and has been one of the more eloquent spokespersons on 
this health care bill in the last couple years.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Rhode Island.

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 
15 minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

         PASSAGE OF PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, in these hallowed 
Halls, we have the power to do many things. At times, it might appear 
as if there is no riddle so complex that the careful arrangement of 
words on a paper cannot overcome it. Indeed, the very rationale behind 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act was to

[[Page H2889]]

solve forever the Gordian knot of equality in our citizens' access to 
health care. Yet, for all its words, commands, prescriptions, and 
boards in the bill, Richard Foster, the chief actuary of CMS, has laid 
bare an essential truth about these mandates. Mr. Speaker, they have 
consequences. On page 10 of his recent report, Mr. Foster states 
unequivocally that this bill will make hospitals, long-term care 
facilities, and other part A providers unprofitable.
  It's clear to me, Mr. Speaker, that while we in Washington can pass 
words on paper that guarantee all Americans health care, that the 
doctors and hospitals throughout America may not be around long enough 
to provide them care. More jobs, Mr. Speaker, lost to wrong-headed 
policies being forced upon the American people by this majority.

 CMS CHIEF ACTUARY'S ANALYSIS ON EFFECTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND 
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. WALDEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House told the National 
Association of Counties a while back that Congress needed to pass the 
health care bill so we could find out what's in it. Well, we are 
finding out now.
  The Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
is the independent scorekeeper of legislation like this. Their report 
that they just issued said half of all seniors in America who are on 
Medicare Advantage plans, half, are going to lose that coverage under 
the bill that was signed into law.
  Well, that's a big problem for seniors in Oregon. Oregon has had one 
of the highest penetration rates in the United States of seniors who 
wanted Medicare Advantage and signed up for it. I was out in Ontario, 
Oregon, not long ago, and the seniors there raised their hands and 
said, ``Why are they taking away the Medicare Advantage I have?'' We 
now know under this independent evaluation half of them will lose that 
care, 38,000 seniors in my district alone.
  We need to repeal and replace this law that was jammed through this 
Congress, Mr. Speaker.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Massie). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 3, 2013, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Castro) for 30 minutes.


                             General Leave

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to talk about 
the Affordable Care Act, about some of its milestones and the benefits 
to the people of the United States, also about some of the critiques 
that have come up over the last few years and in the last few months.
  The Affordable Care Act has succeeded in doing a few things. The 
United States, for a long time, has been the wealthiest nation on 
Earth; however, millions and millions of Americans, despite our 
country's wealth, have been unable to get health care insurance. Many 
folks have suffered a very long time, either themselves or their family 
members, in not being able to see a doctor when they have needed to and 
in being kicked off of insurance because they have hit lifetime caps. 
College students have gone without insurance for years because they 
could no longer stay on their parents' plans.
  There was, I know, a discussion earlier on the floor--I think during 
the lunch hour--and there was a question raised by one of the 
Republican Members. Essentially, his question was: What has the 
Affordable Care Act done?

                              {time}  1800

  Well, there are several concrete things that it has done for the 
United States. The first is that 3 million students have been able to 
stay on their parents' insurance plans, where they otherwise would have 
been kicked off before. The average age where students were kicked off 
before was about 19. Under the Affordable Care Act, millions of college 
students can now stay on until the age of 26.
  We know this number--5 million people, so far, and growing--have 
signed up for health care through the exchanges. Five million people. 
That is very significant. That number continues to grow, as some of the 
busiest days for the health care Web site and for the call-in number 
have been over the last few weeks.
  Also, 4.4 million Americans have signed up for health care through 
Medicaid. They have been covered through Medicaid expansion.
  We can talk about the fact that some States have decided not to 
expand Medicaid. So millions of these people, including in my home 
State of Texas, low-income Americans, most of these people going to 
work every day, working hard to support themselves and their family 
members who are still low-income Americans, but because the State 
governments have not expanded Medicaid in many States, they have not 
been able to get covered. So we are going to talk about that.
  Another issue I want to talk a little bit about is something that is 
very significant for millions and millions of Americans, and that is 
mental health parity with physical health.
  For years, we tried in State legislatures--I know I tried in Texas, 
as well as people across the United States--to make sure that mental 
health issues are covered by insurance in the same way that you would 
cover a broken arm or broken leg or even cancer. Millions of Americans 
suffer from anxiety, depression, and a slew of mental health issues. 
Previously, they were unable to get covered.
  So those are some of the issues that we are going to talk about this 
evening.
  I now yield to my good friend Congressman, Gene Green from Texas.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. First of all, I thank my colleague from San 
Antonio. We are both Texans, and we know the problems. You served a lot 
of years in the State legislature. I did, too. Frankly, I think a lot 
of our problems could have been dealt with if Texas would have expanded 
Medicaid. We are actually giving back money to the Federal Government 
and not covering children and families in our community because of 
that.
  Frankly, even with the problems with the rollout of the Affordable 
Care Act, I know some States have done a great job, like Kentucky and 
California. Some States haven't. But I would think that if Texas did 
their own exchange, we could be the ones making those decisions, I 
think particularly with the Medicaid expansion.
  I appreciate you asking for the Special Order tonight because we are 
coming down up to the deadline of March 31. In fact, I have to do a 
commercial first.
  A lot of us have done these events on how people can sign up for the 
Affordable Care Act. I have one that we are sponsoring this Saturday at 
the Harris County Department of Education building. It is at 6300 
Irvington Boulevard in our district. I am partnering with some of your 
former colleagues: State Representative Armando Walle; State 
Representative Jessica Farrar; our relatively new State senator, Sylvia 
Garcia; and our city council member, Ed Gonzalez. We are doing that 
this Saturday from 9 to 1 so people can come in and sign up.
  The success, though, is that the Web site was down for 2 months, but 
we have seen a huge number of people signing up--5 million as of last 
week. I hear on Monday of this week they had 1 million contacts, both 
by phone and to the Web site.
  So there is a need out there for the Affordable Care Act. It is 
landmark health care reform.
  I was on the subcommittee and the Committee of Energy and Commerce to 
help draft part of it. We did days and nights of drafting amendments. 
We had both bipartisan amendments adopted, including one on mental 
health that Congressman Murphy from Pennsylvania and I had worked out 
to expand mental health coverage.
  Of course, we live in a bicameral Congress and sometimes the Senate 
doesn't always do what we would like

[[Page H2691]]

to do on the House side. That is the nature of it. But the Affordable 
Care Act is expanding health care access.
  You mentioned some of the successes that we have. I know as a State 
legislator I would have loved to have a State law that required 
insurance companies to pay 80 percent of their premiums they received 
back as benefits. I don't know of any State that does that. I would 
have loved to have that in Texas.
  Somebody who pays an insurance premium, whether it is employer health 
care or an individual health policy, they can be guaranteed that 80 
percent of their premium will come back in benefits. That is what the 
Federal law is.
  We hear our Republican colleagues say they still haven't come up to 
an alternative to the Affordable Care Act--because they can't.
  That is one of the successes in there, and there are a lot of 
successes. In fact, some of that law is actually Republican ideas that 
have been built up over the last 20 or 30 years, saying, How can we 
cover the uninsured in our country?
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That is right.
  Congressman, once upon a time, these were the ideas of the Heritage 
Foundation. This was a conservative movement, conservative ideas, about 
how folks would take individual responsibility. Because, as you know, 
being in Harris County, our large hospitals systems end up with 
millions of dollars in uncompensated care every year.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Our Harris County Hospital district is our 
catchment. But not all counties in the State of Texas have that option 
to have a hospital district.
  Even in our area, I have a district that is one of the highest in the 
country of people who work who don't get insurance through their 
employer. That is why the Affordable Care Act is important. In our 
district, we have an estimated 261,000 people who would have the 
opportunity to get health care through the Affordable Care Act. And we 
are hoping to sign them up. We started in November, and we have had 
these workshops literally all over our district, in partnership with 
lots of different groups.
  The Affordable Care Act is particularly important in our districts 
because we have one of the highest rates in the country of people who 
are uninsured. It is essential people know that the financial 
assistance is available under the Affordable Care Act that can lower 
their health care costs. In fact, nearly 6 of the 10 uninsured people 
will find that they can find health coverage for $100 or less a month.
  Like I said, this Saturday we are having a forum. This forum is a 
great opportunity for people to come and actually learn about health 
care options, because health care insurance is important.
  After World War II, our country made a decision. The countries we 
rebuilt in Western Europe had government-run insurance. Canada has 
government-run insurance. Our country decided to go with employer-based 
insurance. And that worked well up until about 10 or 12 years ago, 
where we started seeing employers drop that coverage.

  At one time in our country, 80 percent of the people who worked had 
insurance through their employer. Now it is below 60 percent, and it is 
getting worse. Although with the Affordable Care Act, we are actually 
seeing increases. Because even a small business can be eligible for 
subsidies to cover their employees under the Affordable Care Act.
  Like I said, as a member the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am 
proud of us passing something. It is not perfect, but it is a step in 
the right direction. I would hope that this Congress and maybe a future 
Congress can say, Okay, let's see what is wrong with the Affordable 
Care Act. It is just like we had to go back and fix Medicare on a 
number of occasions.
  Nobody wants to abolish Medicare. It is one of the greatest pieces of 
legislation that we have ever passed. I would hope that over the years 
we would not only build on the Affordable Care Act to make people--just 
like with Medicare--know that they don't have to worry about putting 
their families in bankruptcy because they have an illness. The 
Affordable Care Act will help us on the road to protect that.
  I appreciate your leadership tonight on this. I know I have a 
colleague from California from my class who is up next. I thank you for 
your time.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congressman.
  A few things that you pointed out that I think are especially 
noteworthy. The first is that there is no perfect bill that we pass 
here. And especially, the larger the bill is, the more you are going to 
have to come back and change it and tweak it. That is what you have 
seen with the Affordable Care Act. So there is no surprise that we are 
going to have to have some changes to it. Quite frankly, there have 
been some changes in deadlines. There have been some other changes. 
Americans rightly ask, Well, why is the President or the administration 
doing that?
  Well, it is very simple. Last year, for example, Congress passed the 
least amount of legislation of any year on record. The President is 
taking action to improve the law because the Congress will not or 
cannot. Somebody has got to be doing something here in Washington. 
Unfortunately, in the House of Representatives, we have hit a 
standstill. So the administration is making sure and listening to 
Americans and making the changes that are necessary.
  No bill is ever going to be perfect. Social Security was deeply 
criticized when it was enacted. For several years, Medicare was deeply 
criticized when it was enacted.
  So this is no surprise. Americans in previous generations have seen 
this before, have lived through this before, and this program has been 
a successful one. It will be even more successful as we go forward, and 
we will continue to talk a bit about some of the benefits to millions 
of Americans.
  Before I yield to my colleague from California, Lucille Roybal-
Allard, I want to point out that there are a few ways people can get 
information and sign up. We have been talking a lot about the Web site 
and asking people to go online, but there is also the traditional 
method.
  We have the online Web site at healthcare.gov, of course. Also, by 
mail. You can download an application and send it in by mail. You can 
go in person here. You can also call by phone at 1-800-318-2596. I know 
there has been a lot of emphasis on the Web site, but you can also 
enroll by these traditional methods. That means a lot to a lot of folks 
in different communities.
  I was at an enrollment fair on Saturday, and there was a woman who 
looked to be somewhere between 55 and 60. Quite honestly, she was a bit 
baffled by having to get on the computer, even thought she was being 
assisted, and she asked, Is there another way I can do it where I don't 
have to use a computer? The answer to that is yes, there are 
traditional methods.
  With that, I want to yield to Congresswoman Roybal-Allard from the 
wonderful city of Los Angeles.
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for 
organizing tonight's Special Order on the Affordable Care Act, which is 
helping to make health care a reality for millions of Americans across 
our Nation.
  Luckily, California is one of the States that has a plan. It has 
bought into the Affordable Care Act. As a result, thousands of 
California are now benefiting from what we in California call Covered 
California, which is the ACA plan there.
  By enrolling in the Affordable Care Act, parents and their children 
no longer have to endure illnesses or painful injuries because they 
can't afford a doctor. Parent don't have to worry about their children 
getting a preventable illness because they can't afford to have them 
vaccinated or treated for a chronic preventable disease.
  Why? Because under the ACA, many immunizations and preventative 
services are free.
  Seniors and adults are also eligible for free preventive services, 
including annual checkups, annual mammograms, prostate cancer 
screenings, and immunizations. Young adults, including 435,000 young 
Californians, don't have to worry about being a burden on their family 
if they get sick or are in an accident because they can remain on their 
parents' insurance until age 26, and get affordable insurance after 
that.
  Also critical is the fact that under the Affordable Care Act, no one 
can be

[[Page H2692]]

denied health care coverage because of a preexisting condition.
  The ACA is a wonderful opportunity, as you have pointed out, for 
uninsured Americans to get the health care that they need to improve 
the quality of life for themselves and for that of their family. And I 
would like to just give one example of that.
  A constituent of mine from the city of Bell by the name of Roberto 
Rivas is in his mid-twenties. On December 21, 2013, he arrived at 6 
a.m. to enroll in a health insurance plan before going to work at KFC, 
where he is not offered any health insurance. He is also a full-time 
student at Trade Tech studying chemistry. He would like to use his 
education to study proteins and to research viruses such as hepatitis 
and other infectious diseases.
  Until the age of 21, along with his 10-year-old sister, he was 
covered by his mother under Medi-Cal. When he turned 21, he was no 
longer eligible for Medi-Cal. He lost that insurance and was left 
completely without any health insurance whatsoever.
  Shortly after, he began suffering from breathing problems. He went to 
a doctor and found out that he had pneumonia. Later, after being 
treated for that pneumonia, he received a medical bill for $4,663. He 
had no insurance to cover that. He even asked for charity care services 
to help cover his expenses, but was denied that request.
  Robert said:

       As a minimum wage worker and a full-time student, it is 
     hard to get health insurance.

  Thanks to ObamaCare:

       Now I can go to school and not stress about getting sick 
     and ending up in the hospital.
       I'm calling everybody in my family to tell them I'm 
     enrolled in health care and that they need to come out and 
     get covered, too.

                              {time}  1815

  Robert Rivas was also astounded by the service, the friendly faces, 
and the applause he received when he enrolled; and he says:

       To know so many people actually care about me getting 
     health insurance is great.

  This is just one example of the millions of Americans who are 
benefitting from what we call ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act.
  I am hoping that more Californians who have not applied, and 
Americans across the country who are uninsured and can benefit greatly 
by enrolling in health care, that they don't miss out.
  There are only 5 days left until the enrollment deadline of March 31. 
I hope that, today, they will visit healthcare.gov or use any services 
which you have already outlined to enroll in the Affordable Care Act 
for themselves and for their families.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congresswoman. And what a powerful 
story that you have told. I am glad to hear that California has done 
such an incredible job in making health care available to its 
constituents and to its residents. Thank you.
  I would also point out, Congresswoman Roybal-Allard mentioned 
something that is very significant because Republicans have tried to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act now--I think it is about 51 times--50, 
51 times.
  We make no bones about it. There are a lot of Americans--a decent 
number of Americans who agree with that argument, who say repeal it; 
but let's understand, if your argument is repeal it, then understand 
exactly what you are repealing.
  First, there is no plan that has been offered by the other side--no 
alternative. Also, if you repeal it, what you are saying now is you are 
going to, again, allow insurance companies to kick off cancer patients 
because they hit a lifetime limit, send them out of the hospital, send 
them home.
  You are not going to allow recent college graduates to stay on their 
parents' insurance until they are 26 years old.
  Remember, health care problems and big hospital bills, for years now, 
have been the number one reason for personal bankruptcies. People would 
run out of insurance money.
  They would have to take out all of their savings from their bank 
accounts to pay their hospital bills; and then, they could no longer 
make their mortgage payment, their car payment. They couldn't help 
their kids go to college. They essentially became broke.
  If you are talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act, then you 
have to accept and be upfront about the kind of future that you are 
inviting, which is a travel back to the past.
  I have been surprised in my time here that Republicans have tried to 
repeal this law 51 times, and what is more surprising is that there is 
no alternative plan to the Affordable Care Act.
  That is why, in the surveys, you see over 60 percent of Americans 
that say: Yeah, I may have an issue with it. I didn't like the way the 
Web site was done. I disagree with some parts of it, but I don't want 
it repealed. I want it improved.
  Unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, the strategy has not 
been to improve this thing and work with us to make it better. Like I 
said, any big law--any big law--whether it is about health care or 
mortgages or financial services or anything, any big law is going to 
require some tweaks and some changes.
  So I hope that they will listen to the voice of Americans and take a 
different tack.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Cardenas).
  Mr. CARDENAS. I thank my good friend from San Antonio, Texas.
  Congressman Castro, you are absolutely right. To go back away from 
the Affordable Care Act means to go back to the old system, and the old 
system is not the good old days.
  When we are looking at families who are fortunate to even have 
insurance, their insurance is going up seven to 17 percent, year over 
year over year. That is unsustainable.
  People's income does not go up that high, that fast. People's 
opportunity to find other ways to find that money somewhere else in 
their budget doesn't go up that fast, so those were not the good old 
days. Actually, the best days are yet to come.
  What we have seen 52 times here is an opportunity--or a tried 
opportunity to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, and by calling it by 
another name doesn't make it bad.
  Yes, the rollout could have happened better, but the bottom line is 
the good days are yet to come. They are here now. The past are not the 
good old days.
  I would like to thank you for this opportunity to speak. I think it 
is important for us to understand that what we are talking about here 
is high quality affordable health care, which is something that was 
denied and out of reach for so many seniors and families in my district 
in the San Fernando Valley and across the country.
  One in three people in my district were uninsured, but Covered 
California is giving those people the opportunity to purchase 
affordable plans that will give them the care they need when they get 
sick and the preventative services they will need to stay healthy.
  While the rollout of the Affordable Care Act hasn't been perfect, 
Covered California has been very successful in providing a simple, 
straightforward way to enroll.
  I feel really bad for those States where their State legislatures and 
their Republican Representatives have denied them the opportunity to 
experience good affordable health care. I hope that they can catch up.
  Last week, Covered California announced that they had enrolled over 1 
million people through the State-run exchange. That is in California 
alone. Their critical work has helped hundreds of thousands of 
California families, seniors, small businesses to gain access to high 
quality affordable health care that was once denied to them for too 
long.
  My staff and I have been working alongside Covered California to help 
enroll residents in the San Fernando Valley. Over the last few months, 
I have been hosting a series of successful enrollment workshops for the 
Affordable Care Act; and as a matter of fact, we will reach 30 events 
by this weekend.
  This is where families learn about the options available to them 
under the new health care law, including learning about insurance 
policies that can be purchased through the Covered California health 
insurance exchange, which has been successful in getting folks 
enrolled.
  More than 500 families have taken advantage of these workshops just 
in my district alone.
  Wow. Can you imagine, Congressman Castro, if every single one of the 
435 Congressional Members rolled up their sleeves and helped people get 
enrolled?

[[Page H2693]]

That would be millions upon millions of more American families that 
would be enrolled in affordable health care.
  In the last week before the deadline, every Representative should 
take this opportunity to do the same job that we have been able to do 
in my district. We must help families sign up for the Affordable Health 
Care Act.
  The day will come very soon when the truth will overcome the lies 
that have scared so many people. Billions of dollars have been spent 
scaring people away from trying to even enroll in the Affordable Care 
Act.
  Let me give you an example. I have met with parents who have come to 
workshops to sign up, and they have anxiety and fear in their eyes; but 
thank God, just moments later, their fears go away when they find out 
that they now have affordable, reliable health care.
  People with mild asthma that were once denied health care can no 
longer be discriminated against. They are no longer denied health care, 
and they can breathe easy knowing that they can now see a doctor, and 
they can actually get the medicines that they need just to breathe.
  I met with a gentleman who was sitting there with his wife and his 
daughter, the sole income earner for that family. I don't know how he 
does it, but with $9 an hour, he manages to feed a family of three; and 
he was worried that he couldn't afford maybe $30, $40, $50 a month.
  When the person turned the computer around and showed him what his 
eligibility was, he almost came to tears, realizing that, once and for 
all, himself, his wife, and his teenage daughter can now have health 
care.
  I will tell you what. This is serious business. America, it is time 
that you sign up for affordable health care. Just try it. Don't worry; 
be happy.
  Sign up for the insurance that you deserve.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congressman Cardenas. Thank you for 
all of your work.
  You also raise a great point, which is folks will often see the 
sticker price of the insurance on the exchanges.
  By the way, I, as well as many other Members of Congress, bought our 
insurance off of the exchanges. We were getting asked that question a 
lot. You know, are you going to buy ObamaCare?
  The answer is yes. I bought my insurance off the exchanges, and I 
saved money.
  Folks should make sure that they also check, besides the sticker 
price, what kind of subsidy they get because it is meant to make 
insurance affordable for middle class Americans and others.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle 
Lujan Grisham).
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Thank you very much, 
Congressman Joaquin Castro.
  Muchas gracias, al congresista Joaquin Castro.
  Thank you so much for calling us together to talk about this 
critically important issue for our families.
  Twenty years ago, when I was running the New Mexico Department on 
Aging, I remember an incredibly tragic call from a family of a 60-year-
old woman who had fallen and broken her hip. She was in a hospital in 
Albuquerque.
  Now, of course, hospitals are required to provide stabilizing 
emergency treatment and even surgery if that is required in that 
instance; but unfortunately, this 60-year-old woman didn't have 
insurance, and she was rolled out of the hospital in a wheelchair 
without the required surgery for her hip fracture.
  If the Affordable Care Act was in place when this happened, this 60-
year-old woman could have simply provided her health insurance card to 
someone at the hospital, and the hospital would have stabilized her 
hip, performed the surgery, and then provided follow-up rehabilitation 
care. This would allow this woman to walk again.
  The required stabilization is critical for successful recovery of 
that particular hip injury, and the long-term consequences of not 
receiving the care, in addition to the pain and suffering of this 
woman, are significant. Quite frankly, she would never have walked 
again without that surgery.
  Now, thankfully, in her case, the whole community came together to 
gather enough money to pay for her treatment; but if this were to 
happen today, she could have already purchased subsidized insurance in 
the health insurance marketplace or qualified for Medicaid, and she 
would have been able to receive treatment without the scare and the 
subsequent fundraising by her family in that instance.
  People across the country face situations like this every single day. 
That is why it is critical that we tell our friends and neighbors that 
they only have 5 days left to enroll in health insurance through the 
marketplace--5 days. There is absolutely no time to waste.
  Like many of my colleagues, I have been working with groups in my 
district and have been participating in enrollment events to help 
provide information and to assist New Mexicans to enroll.
  Two of my constituents, Mark and Elizabeth Horst from Albuquerque, 
signed up for bronze plans through the exchange last fall. They make 
$24,000 a year between them and have qualified for $612 in subsidies, 
which covers the cost of the bronze plan.
  Thousands more New Mexicans are still eligible. New Mexico had the 
third highest uninsured of any State before the Affordable Care Act 
went into effect this year. In the Hispanic community, more than 25 
percent are uninsured, and more than that are underinsured.
  Today, more than 360,000 in New Mexico are still eligible for 
enrollment. By enrolling in a plan, you don't have to risk injury or a 
lifetime of debt. You can get your family covered; and, by having 
access to primary care, your family can stay healthier longer.
  I appreciate my colleague's effort today. I thank you very much.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congresswoman.
  We only have a few minutes left, and I would like to yield to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).
  Mr. DOGGETT. I would just like to thank you for the work that you are 
doing on this, and I believe our real message is to the many people out 
there--some of whom may even think that this law has been repealed. 
They have tried so many times.
  As you pointed out a little earlier, this is an opportunity that is 
there for the next 5 days. Get beyond all the political chatter. Turn 
to a group like the American Cancer Society or the American Diabetes 
Association. Look at the information that is there.
  Then go to one of the many enrollment fairs we are having across San 
Antonio this weekend. There is one up in Austin that is going to go 
almost 24 hours straight. These are opportunities to get out and do 
this.
  I know you had a very successful enrollment fair in San Antonio. I 
had one over at Progreso Hall. Our colleague, Pete Gallego, had one out 
at Palo Alto. These have been opportunities for a wide range of our 
neighbors to come out and participate. We just want to encourage them 
to do more.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congressman Doggett, and thank you 
for your work when this bill was being worked on and drafted. Thank you 
for helping to pass it and, since then, passionately making sure that 
people get on to the ACA.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I think, if we keep working together, we can find ways 
to strengthen and improve this, but the main thing is for our families 
to get out there now.
  I think, increasingly, most folks are realizing, as you pointed out, 
with so many efforts to repeal, that the only alternative that they 
offer is ``Nothing Care.''
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.

                          ____________________

[Pages H1722-H1723]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, all things are subject to interpretation, 
but as Nietzsche once said:

       Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is often 
     more a function of power and not truth.

  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office came out with a report 
evaluating the economic impacts of the Affordable Care Act. Since then, 
there are those who have used the power they have to frame a false 
narrative. Rather than talking about what the report actually says, 
they have spent the last week talking about what they would like it to 
say. Their false interpretation of the ObamaCare act is that it will 
cost the American economy 2.5 million jobs; but the truth is that the 
much-misrepresented CBO study didn't say that at all because, as The 
Wall Street Journal accurately reported, reducing the total number of 
hours Americans have to work is very different than eliminating jobs.
  One of the reasons we passed the Affordable Care Act in the first 
place was to fix the pitfalls of this country's employer-based health 
care system. Before the ACA, people with preexisting conditions were 
often forced to stay in their jobs to avoid losing their health care 
coverage. Even if they wanted to leave their jobs to reduce their 
hours, retire early, change careers, or to spend more time with their 
families, they couldn't because doing so would risk their ability to 
provide affordable health insurance for their families.

                              {time}  1015

  What the Affordable Care Act did was right this wrong. By broadening 
access to health insurance, the ACA has increased personal freedom and 
market choice. Now Americans can choose jobs based on what they want to 
be doing instead of staying where they are unhappy just to keep their 
insurance.
  The expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the subsidies available in 
the exchanges will give Americans the flexibility they need to raise 
their families, not encourage workers to seek less employment, which 
was one of the most misleading claims made after the report was 
released.
  The idea that hardworking Americans will modify their employment just 
to be eligible for social safety net programs is both ludicrous and 
offensive. Nobody wants to live in a situation that makes you eligible 
for Medicaid or other social safety net programs, but too many 
hardworking Americans are forced to.
  In Illinois, a family of four must exist on less than $32,500 per 
year to qualify for these programs. In the Chicago area, the cost of 
living is high and families struggle to make ends meet.
  Measures like Medicaid and SNAP are meant to help people lift 
themselves from poverty. Claiming that poor people want to be poor to 
rely more on the government is misguided and just flat out wrong.
  I have said from the beginning that the ACA is far from perfect and 
that we should work together to improve it, but arguing that at-risk 
and low-income Americans will actively choose to work less, reducing 
their own incomes and jeopardizing their family's economic future just 
to ``game the system,'' is not a legitimate issue and speaks volumes 
about the extreme views that are dividing our government and preventing 
real reform from occurring.
  By focusing on false interpretations, we are forgetting the economic 
benefits contained in the law. To quote the CBO report:

       If some people seek to work less, other applicants will be 
     readily available to fill those positions and the overall 
     effect on employment will be muted.

  At a time when long-term employment is at its highest since World War 
II, there are more than enough workers willing and able to take these 
jobs. That is why the director of the CBO recently testified about the 
likelihood of the ACA creating jobs, not eliminating them.
  The report also acknowledged that insurance premiums under the law 
are 15 percent lower than originally forecast, that ``the slowdown in 
Medicare cost growth'' is ``broad and persistent,''

[[Page H1723]]

and that enrollments will increase over time to where they would have 
been if not for the Web site's issues.
  Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans 
can now access affordable health insurance. With a focus on personal 
responsibility, preventive care, consumer protections, and increased 
choices, the Affordable Care Act has helped empower Americans to lead 
healthier lives.
  Let's put aside the punditry and focus on the facts.

     MARCH 20, 2012--SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in the same spot where I was 
about 2 years ago, March 23, 2010, to celebrate the passage of one of 
the most important acts that this body has ever passed: the Affordable 
Care Act.
  On March 23, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of that 
landmark decision. Of course, next week the Supreme Court will hear 
arguments on whether the individual mandate is permissible or not. Let 
us hope that the Supreme Court will act according to the law.

[[Page H1396]]

  The Affordable Care Act will change the landscape of our Nation's 
health care delivery system for the better. I hosted a telephone town 
hall last night with my constituents on the Affordable Care Act and was 
joined by the Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, Bill Corr, 
to answer questions from folks in my district about how it will affect 
them.
  We listened to comments and stories about people who have been in the 
doughnut hole, seniors, that cost them a lot of money. We told them 
about the fact some of them knew that once they go into the doughnut 
hole--after they spend about $2,500 or $2,700 and up to about $5,000 
you go into that hole--that the moneys will be paid for, for generic 
drugs, with a 50 percent discount because of the Affordable Care Act. 
That is extremely important for citizens and others with high drug 
prices.
  Children will be able to stay on their parents' insurance, if they 
choose to, up to the age of 26, which didn't happen before; and that's 
so important for young people and for parents to know the security that 
their children will be insured if they have a health care crisis.
  Doctors will be able to see seniors for preventative care without 
cost. That's happening right now for those on Medicare and will happen 
for everybody in 2014 when the law goes into effect for all--
mammograms, colonoscopies, shots for children, vaccinations, et cetera.
  The insurance companies will no longer be able to have lifetime 
limits on how much people can use their insurance in case of illness.
  There will be a consumer-friendly exchange where you can shop for 
prices for insurance and compare insurance policies to get what's best 
for you.
  You can't arbitrarily be dropped from coverage by your insurance 
company simply because you get sick, and preexisting conditions will no 
longer be a basis to deny somebody insurance. Already today, for 
children up to the age of 19, preexisting conditions cannot stop you 
from getting insurance.
  I had polio when I was a child. I would not like to think of any 
child that gets an illness such as that today, whether it be diabetes 
or cancer or any other illness, to be denied insurance because of a 
preexisting condition. That, because of the Affordable Care Act, will 
not occur in the future in this country.
  Insurance companies have taken people off of insurance because 
they've used too much in a year or too much in a lifetime, and that's 
going to stop.
  The idea of getting preventative care, which Medicare provides now 
and all will have in the future, will lead to lower health care costs 
because, if you catch illnesses early, it's much more cost efficient to 
treat them, and lives will be saved as well.
  Insurance companies are required to spend at least 80 percent of 
their moneys on treating patients, not on executive pay, advertising, 
administrative costs, or other such costs to the consumer; and if they 
go over that in any way whatsoever, the consumer will get a rebate. 
Insurance companies must now publish justifications for any premium 
increases they are seeking of more than 10 percent on the Internet, and 
outside experts will evaluate whether those increases are justified. 
The consumer will be protected.
  The doughnut hole ending, which I talked about earlier, has helped 
3.6 million seniors receive discounts of $2.1 billion, each senior 
saving an average of $604.
  The preventative care services I mentioned under Medicare, 32.5 
million seniors have already received one or more of those preventative 
services; and youngsters have received them as well because they get 
preventative care in their vaccinations without having to have a copay, 
which might stop their parent from taking them to the doctor to get 
those vaccinations which can prevent illnesses later.
  Seniors are now receiving free annual wellness visits under Medicare, 
and 2.3 million seniors in traditional Medicare have already taken 
advantage of the new annual wellness visit.
  Young adults stay on their insurance, as I mentioned; 2.5 million 
additional young people have gained insurance over the last year.
  Paul Krugman wrote in yesterday's New York Times that what is called 
by the Republican Party ObamaCare--which really, if you think about it, 
is a good thing, Obama cares, but it's not intended to be by them as, 
really, Obama-RomneyCare, because the plan we adopted is based upon 
what Mitt Romney did in Massachusetts to make sure that the people of 
Massachusetts bought insurance and the burden was shared in an 
appropriate way.
  Thank you, Mitt Romney. Thank you, President Obama. Thank you, United 
States American Congress.

                   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPEAL EFFORTS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the passage and implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act is the culmination of an American political journey 
that started a century ago with Teddy Roosevelt in 1912 with the Bull 
Moose Party--also a Republican--and picked up years later by Harry 
Truman and other Presidents, including Richard Nixon, another 
Republican. The most recent groundwork for reform was laid in part by 
the former Republican Presidential candidate, Robert Dole, as an 
alternative to Hillary Clinton's plan, and by the present Republican 
Presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. I commend them for championing the 
concept of the individual mandate back when it wasn't quite as 
unpopular on their side of the aisle.
  The history of reforming our Nation's health care system is a strong 
one that has historically been championed by lawmakers on both sides of 
the political spectrum, until this Congress. My colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have wasted hours upon hours debating and voting upon 
the various versions of the legislation that would repeal the 
Affordable Care Act.
  My colleagues know that these initiatives are fruitless. They know 
that voting over and over and over again--more than 30 times total--on 
measures to repeal the Affordable Care Act is a waste of time, but they 
keep calling for these votes. Do you want to know why? Because they 
want to distract the American public from the fact that they are so 
committed to unseating our President, Barack Obama, that they haven't 
passed any effective jobs-creating legislation since they took over the 
majority in this House in 2010.
  The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality 
of the Affordable Care Act, and it's time to face the facts. Earlier 
today, a gentleman from Virginia said, Oh, it was just 5-4. Bush v. 
Gore was 5-4. We accepted that the person who got the least votes and 
lost Florida was President of the United States for 8 years, but the 
consequences we still have to face.
  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. As a result, millions 
of Americans who were previously uninsured or underinsured have access 
to affordable, high-quality health care. In fact, the number of 
Americans uninsured is equal to the population of 25 of the 50 States.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans and small 
businesses have already benefited from lower health care costs, 
increased access to preventive care, and stronger patient protections.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 12.8 million families will receive 
rebates that total over $1 billion from insurers next month, in August, 
because the law requires companies to provide value for their premium 
dollar. Never before has that happened.
  Community health centers in my district have received over $10 
million to deliver health care services to underserved and impoverished 
Memphians, and 170,000 households in my district will get a premium 
credit so they can afford quality health insurance coverage.
  Women no longer are considered a preexisting condition, and insurance 
companies can't charge them more, which they did, by 40 percent.
  Medicare beneficiaries now have access to preventive care and 
services without any copay.
  And 64,000 people in my district will go from uninsured to insured.
  32.5 million seniors nationwide received one or more preventive care 
treatments in 2011.
  The doughnut hole is being closed; 50 percent discounts on covered 
brand-name generics.
  Annual and lifetime caps on health care coverage are now illegal, 
meaning insurance companies can't kick you off the plan just because 
you get cancer or are in an accident or have a heart attack.
  Our children are now protected because insurers are prevented from 
denying coverage to children under 19 for preexisting conditions. This 
means up to 17 million children with preexisting conditions are now 
protected from discrimination.
  Young adults can remain on their parents' insurance until they're 26, 
providing some protection in this uncertain job market.

                              {time}  1050

  It's now affordable for small businesses to provide insurance to 
employees. The tax credits cover up to 35 percent of the cost of 
coverage and will go up to 50 percent in 2014. In fact, in 2011, 
360,000 small employers used the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit 
to help them afford health insurance for 2 million workers.
  One of the most misleading arguments by my colleagues concerns that 
penalty that will be assessed on those financially-able Americans who 
choose not to purchase insurance, thereby not taking responsibility for 
their health care. Responsibility. That's one of the keynotes of the 
Republican side.
  But if an uninsured person in my district gets into a car accident or 
comes down with an aggressive illness, they're taken to a public 
hospital in Memphis called The MED. The MED treats everybody because 
they have to, and when The MED takes cares of those people, the 
property owners, the responsible people, pay for it through higher 
property taxes, or you pay for it with your insurance, if you have it, 
because it's uncompensated care if you go to a non-public hospital.
  The time and effort put in by nurses and doctors and assistants at 
The MED aren't free. The medical devices and supplies that The MED used 
to treat those uninsured people aren't free. Every single resident of 
Shelby County pays for those services when a person seeks emergency 
services there, and the taxes go up.
  People who choose not to buy insurance for themselves and their 
families, even with the Federal Government providing incentives and 
credits, are irresponsible free riders, and it's the free riders that 
the other side's trying to talk about, not the conscientious and 
responsible people who take control of their own lives and their own 
destinies.
  Not taking responsibility for the health of yourself and your family 
is reckless. The free riders have been a burden on our national health 
care system for far too long, and it's time they take responsibility 
for their actions and their health. This penalty, which will be equal 
to no more than the estimated cost of an insurance premium, is the way 
we do it.
  It's long past time we implement the health reform initiated by Teddy 
Roosevelt and championed by people of both parties. It's time Americans 
realize and take advantage of their right to quality healthcare. And 
it's long past time my colleagues stop playing partisan politics and 
start working on behalf of the American people, not giant corporations, 
once again.

                THE HIGH COST OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I received an email from 
Scott, a constituent of the 5th District who lives in Boone, North 
Carolina. Here is what he had to say:

       With all of the talk to this point about the effects of the 
     Affordable Care Act, it has just turned into brutal reality 
     for me and my family. I received a letter from Blue Cross 
     Blue Shield this week regarding my coverage. All of the 
     promises of if you like your current health coverage, you 
     will be able to keep it is absolutely untrue. Blue Cross has 
     dropped my current plan that I was relatively happy with and 
     was expecting to continue using. Blue Cross will be moving me 
     into a new plan where the cost is devastating for my family. 
     My monthly premium is increasing 55 percent, $3,816 more per 
     year, and my out-of-pocket expenses will cost my family an 
     additional $3,650 per year. So, all in all, I will be paying 
     an additional $7,466 next year for health insurance and 
     copayments on top of my already high premiums. I do not 
     qualify for any of the subsidies either, so this one is all 
     on the back of this middle class family of four. I have a 4-
     year-old daughter and a 2-year-old daughter. I have no choice 
     but to keep them covered any way I can as any father would. 
     But the new outlays of $7,466 will be a huge burden. We will

[[Page H6460]]

     all have to make some big changes in our family to be able to 
     afford this. I knew the Affordable Care Act would be tough on 
     someone like myself, but I had no idea how hard it would hit 
     me and my family.

  Mr. Speaker, Scott is not alone. Families across this country are 
baffled by ObamaCare sticker shock. Accepting the devastating truth 
that costs will be much higher for them next year, some families are 
trying to find a way to make it work, but they can't even get to the 
Web site.
  But what do they hear from Washington? ObamaCare apologists say, Be 
patient with us. We will get these glitches sorted out. It will take a 
few years, and you will all be used to it.
  Mr. Speaker, if only those voices in Washington would be willing to 
give the American people the same time and patience they are demanding. 
A bipartisan House majority has asked for families to have 1 penalty-
free year to figure out what ObamaCare will mean for their families and 
for their budgets, 1 penalty-free year, not unlike the penalty-free 
year the President gave to Big Business all on his own.
  Fairness: that is what we have asked for. Fairness: that is what 
Senate Democrats are refusing to discuss. Fairness: that is what the 
President describes as ransom.

     AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS KILLING THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF AMERICA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, every day now for the past 3 years, I 
have heard from the good people of Georgia's Third Congressional 
District about how expensive their health insurance costs have become 
and will become as a result of ObamaCare. On Tuesday, their fears of 
just how unaffordable this Affordable Care Act is became a truly bleak 
reality to them.
  If this train wreck of a law is truly affordable, then why have 
Georgians seen their premiums increase as much as 300 percent on the 
exchanges? If it is affordable, then why do 57 percent of Americans 
oppose ObamaCare? If this law is affordable, then why is Ruth from 
LaGrange opting to pay the penalty and forgo insurance because she and 
her husband can no longer afford to pay their family's premiums under 
this Affordable Health Care Act? I guess even if Ruth likes her plan, 
she really can't keep it. She was lied to.
  One thing supporters of ObamaCare always tout is that it will help 
those who are very sick or have preexisting conditions get access to 
affordable care. Well, let me tell you about Cindy from Newnan who is 
fighting a brave battle with cancer. Much to her surprise, she has been 
told by her doctor that under the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, some 
of the treatments in medicine that make a difference in her being sick 
just a few days instead of a few weeks will no longer be covered. What 
about someone who does not have a few weeks? What are they supposed to 
do? And how do we explain that to Cindy's children?
  You know it is a sad day when employers like IBM are left with no 
choice but to kick retirees off their health care plans. What a reward 
to those like David of Griffin who have given so many years 
contributing to their company's success.
  And it is not just hurting American families. It is killing small 
businesses, the economic engine of our country. I just got a letter 
from Dale in LaGrange, who is one of four owners of a heating and air 
conditioning company which self-insures their employees.
  In an effort to comply with ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, in 
2011, the heating and air conditioning company saw their health care 
costs go up $38,000 compared to 2010. The same thing happened in 2012. 
Their costs went up almost $40,000 from 2011. This means they went from 
spending $115,000 on health care for their employees in 2010 to almost 
$195,000 just 2 years later.
  What is just as concerning is employers who have been forced by 
ObamaCare to increase their employees' premiums and no longer offer 
health insurance for spouses or children.

                              {time}  1130

  This change has been a financial disaster for Melanie of Hamilton 
whose husband will no longer be covered by her employer, TSYS, a great 
company in my district and a stable source of jobs.
  For 3 years, we have seen the disastrous consequences of this 
supposedly Affordable Care Act, and in just 3 days since the exchanges 
have gone live, we have heard hundreds of stories similar to the ones I 
just told. Imagine how much worse things can become in 3 months.
  But listen, it's not just the lies we have been told, but it's the 
lies we're still being told--such as California reporting they had 5 
million hits. Finally today, they confessed, they only had 655,000.
  As I have said time and time again, the easy solution is for the 
President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join 
House Republicans and agree to a 1-year delay and defund, just like he 
has done delay for Big Business and his buddies. Why don't we do it for 
the American people? Why don't we put all of us in the same class 
rather than trying to divide this country? Why don't we do the delay? 
Give them time, if they can, to straighten out this mess and put 
everybody, small businesses, Americans, everybody, employed and 
unemployed, in the same class.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Gardner) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. Speaker, when the President began his push to pass 
the partisan Affordable Care Act, he did so with two primary promises: 
the promise that if you like your health care plan, you will be able to 
keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away. That was 
the plan that this Chamber voted for when they passed the so-called 
Affordable Care Act. That was the plan the United States Senate voted 
for when they passed the so-called Affordable Care Act: If you like 
your health care, you can keep it.
  In 2011, Richard Foster, the Chief Actuary of Medicare, testified 
before Congress that this promise would not come true, the promise that 
if you liked your health care, if you liked your health insurance plan, 
you would get to keep it. The Chief Actuary of Medicare--he is not a 
Democrat or Republican appointee--said that this promise, the promise 
that was made when this bill passed, won't come true.
  Over the past several months, my office has received countless 
letters, emails, tweets and Facebook comments from people around this 
country and around my district in Colorado who have said thanks to 
ObamaCare they are losing their health insurance, they are losing their 
family's plan. This promise for them is not coming true.
  When I first got elected to Congress, I made a decision that I would 
reject congressional health insurance, that I would reject the Federal 
health care plan, because I wanted to be in the same boat as my 
constituents. Just a couple of weeks ago, I too received a letter in 
the mail from our insurance plan, our private provider, in Colorado for 
our family, and it said this: We notify you about the upcoming 
discontinuation of your plan. This letter right here that says my 
family's plan is being canceled.
  Mr. President, where is the promise? Mr. President, if you like your 
health care plan you'll be able to keep it--tell that to the thousands 
of people in my district who are losing their health insurance, to my 
family, to millions of people around this country for whom this promise 
that you made when you sold this bill is not coming true.
  The plan that my family had was an affordable plan. We shopped for 
it. We worked hard to find a plan that met our needs in rural Colorado. 
We found a plan that is now being canceled. The plan that replaces it--
the plan that replaces it--now increases in cost by over 100 percent. 
In fact, the plan that is most similar to the one we had is now going 
up to $1,480 a month. It is a 100 percent increase from the plan that 
we had.
  But the President said if you had your health insurance that you 
liked, you would get to keep it. The President also said the second 
primary promise, though, was that if you had your plan and you got to 
keep it, we're going to make sure that this bill, the Affordable Care 
Act, brings down your cost. Yet we know that that's not coming true 
either, as people around this country are facing higher insurance 
costs, higher plan costs, canceling their plans, forcing them to go to 
other alternatives.
  In the letter that we received canceling my family's plan it said 
this: that I have options, I have options to purchase another 
individual health plan from us, purchase a plan from another carrier, 
or go through the health care exchange in Colorado, an exchange that 
was just reported in the newspaper to have significant computer 
glitches even though it is supposed to be up and running on October 1. 
But not one of these options, not a single one of these options include 
being able to keep the plan that my family had, despite the President's 
promise, the promise that if you liked your insurance you would be able 
to keep it.
  Mr. President, where is your promise today? Will you explain to the 
American people that neither of those promises--the primary reasons you 
pushed the health care bill--are untrue. Explain that to the American 
people.
  In recent reports we've seen from Forbes an analysis that ObamaCare 
will increase underlying insurance rates for younger men by an average 
of 97 to 99 percent and for women by an average of 55 to 62 percent. 
HHS compared what the Congressional Budget Office projected rates might 
look like in 2016 to its own findings. What happened, of course, in 
this analysis was that premiums, according to Forbes, nationwide will 
be around 16 percent lower. That's what they said. But after the 
analysis, after the analysis by CBO, which looked at the projected 
rates in 2016 compared to its own findings, neither of those numbers 
tell you the statistic that really matters: how much rates will go up 
next year under ObamaCare relative to this year, prior to the law 
taking effect. Looking at families like mine, a 100 percent increase.
  We've received stories from around the district--people who have seen 
their costs increase, people who have seen their insurance canceled. We 
received a message over Twitter that said: I lost my insurance because 
I can't afford the 100 percent cost increase. For the first time in 47 
years I will have to depend on the government for health insurance. 
Another gentleman said he will be dependent on the taxpayers as well 
for the first time in his life.
  Mr. President, explain to the American people why the promises that 
you made, the promises you made to the American people, are simply not 
true.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.

[Pages S2014-S2015]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President Truman once said, ``Healthy 
citizens constitute our greatest national resource.''
  Two years ago last week we passed the affordable care act. We passed 
it to help give every American access to quality affordable health 
care.
  People such as Cece Whitney from Helena, MO, know exactly how much 
help this law provides. Doctors diagnosed Cece with cystic fibrosis by 
age 7. By high school she carried an oxygen tank. By the end of college 
she received a double lung transplant. Even with insurance coverage 
Cece and her family paid tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket. 
But things looked even worse when she hit an arbitrary coverage limit, 
and if she had lost her insurance before health reform she might not 
have been able to find any insurance coverage at all.
  Insurance companies could have turned her away simply because she was 
born with cystic fibrosis. But now, thanks to the affordable care act, 
Cece will always be covered. She will always have access to the care 
she needs.
  A year ago, on the affordable care act's first anniversary, Cece 
shared her story about seeing health reform signed into law with her 
local newspaper. She said she cried tears--tears of extreme joy. She 
wrote:

       I knew that I no longer had to worry about losing or being 
     denied coverage because of my `preexisting condition.' And I 
     no longer was going to be denied coverage for exceeding 
     arbitrary caps set by insurance companies.

  Cece's story is not unique. Health reform is working for people in 
Montana and across the country, and it is saving them money. The law 
improved our health care system and enabled it to focus on prevention 
and keeping Americans healthy. We have reforms to pay for quality of 
care rather than quantity of services. In just 2 years, health reform 
has lowered costs for millions of Americans. Parents can now afford to 
cover their entire family, including children up to the age of 26. More 
than 2.5 million young adults have been able to stay on their parents' 
plan thanks to health reform.
  Prescription drugs are now cheaper for seniors because of the act. 
Already more than 5 million Medicare beneficiaries have saved more than 
$3 billion on drugs. Again, that is $3 billion saved by seniors on 
drugs, and health reform eliminates the so-called Medicare prescription 
drug doughnut hole. This puts dollars back in seniors' pockets--dollars 
they can use for groceries or electricity bills.
  Seniors now receive free annual wellness visits and free screenings. 
This focus on prevention leads to better health outcomes, and it keeps 
them healthier. It saves money by allowing seniors and their doctors to 
catch conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes before they 
become serious and costly.
  Health reform also helps those who wish to retire early to afford 
insurance until they qualify for Medicare. The law has provided almost 
$4.5 billion in aid to businesses to give early-retiree coverage to 
these employees. Let me repeat that. The law has provided almost $4.5 
billion in aid to businesses to enable them to give early-retiree 
coverage for their employees.
  Health reform is also saving Americans money through new consumer 
protections. It is ending insurance company abuses. Medical loss ratios 
is one that comes to my mind. Because of health reform, parents can now 
keep their kids who have preexisting conditions on their plan, and 
insurance companies can no longer exclude these children. Insurance 
companies can no longer place lifetime and restrictive yearly limits on 
their health coverage that can cost Americans such as Cece Whitney tens 
of thousands of dollars, and insurance companies can no longer go back 
and scrutinize applications for tiny errors as a way to deny payments 
after a customer gets sick.
  Health reform has also created the Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
Center to put good ideas from the private sector into action. The 
center is already working with more than 7,100 organizations--
hospitals, physicians, consumer groups, and employers included--to 
reduce costly hospital readmissions.
  Health reform provides law enforcement with new tools and resources 
to protect Medicare and Medicaid from fraud and abuse. These efforts 
recovered more than $4 billion last year. New antifraud provisions in 
the act, in the health care bill, helped recover more than $4 billion 
in fraud last year. Just a few weeks ago, Federal agents made the 
largest Medicare fraud bust in U.S. history. Ninety-one people were 
charged with defrauding taxpayers for nearly $300 million.
  More parts of the affordable care act that will help consumers will 
start in the year 2014, including the State-based affordable insurance 
exchanges. On these exchanges people will be able to save money. How? 
By shopping for an insurance plan that is right for them. It is like 
getting on Expedia or Orbitz: you just get on and shop around and find 
the one that is best for you.
  For too long, individuals and small businesses shopping for insurance 
on their own have had very limited options. The plans that were 
available were often too expensive. Now, for the first time, insurance 
companies will have to compete against each other for business on a 
level playing field. That will mean lower premiums, better coverage, 
and more choices.
  Health reform has also reduced government costs by dramatically 
slowing the growth in spending. According to our nonpartisan 
scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, health reform slowed the 
growth in health spending by 4 percent. That will save taxpayer dollars 
and help get our deficit problem under control.
  We need to let the law keep working to save families and taxpayers 
more money. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that repealing the 
affordable care act--repealing it now--would increase the Federal 
deficit by nearly $143 billion over the next decade. Repeal would cost 
the Federal deficit $143 billion over the next decade according to the 
Congressional Budget Office, and it would increase the deficit by more 
than $1 trillion in the decade after that.
  Repealing health reform would also leave tens of millions of 
Americans without insurance. Studies have shown this would cost every 
American family an extra $1,000 a year. That is something we cannot 
afford. The affordable care act has already saved millions of Americans 
money and helped them get affordable health care, and millions more 
will gain access in the coming years. Healthy citizens are, indeed, the 
greatest asset our country has. We need to let health reform keep 
working for all Americans.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, February 10, 2011

  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, America is the strongest Nation in the 
world, we hold our freedoms sacred--and we have fought to protect these 
freedoms for centuries, and many have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Yet, 
there is a great and impending threat to that strength and freedom, a 
threat that imperils millions of Americans--the repeal of our Nation's 
Health Care Reform.
  As a new member of this Congress, protecting Health Care Reform is 
the first line in the sand. I was sent to Washington to fight for Rhode 
Islanders. As I have heard loudly over the past year, and witnessed 
first-hand as a Mayor for the last 8 years, families in my state have 
spent enough time awake at night worrying about where they'll find 
work, or the security of their current job. I will not support any 
action that places an additional burden on the people of Rhode Island. 
I will not have them lie awake at night, now having to once again worry 
that they will lose their health care when they need it most, or 
wondering how they'll pay for this month's prescriptions, or whether 
their child will be denied coverage because of a pre-existing 
condition.
  Just yesterday I had the privilege of hearing from a Rhode Islander, 
Alex Lataille, who spoke at the one and only hearings Congress had, to 
discuss the negative effects of repealing the new health care law.
  Alex graduated last May with two bachelor's degrees, and while 
looking for a job after graduation, he is able to afford health 
insurance because he can stay on his parents' policy. Repealing this 
law means Alex and millions of Americans will lose their coverage.
  Recently while having breakfast in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, I met a 
young woman named Beth. She said she was going to be a constituent of 
mine, and she had only one request. For years she had been, and 
remains, an insurance sales agent. But for as many years, she has been 
denied access to health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. 
Each and every day served as a painful reminder that while she was 
selling insurance to others, she was being denied the very same 
coverage. As someone well attuned to the health care industry and the 
Affordable Care Act itself, this young woman knew that health care 
reform meant hope, provided certainty, and would finally allow her to 
get the access to affordable health care she would need--relieving her 
of years of fear and anxiety. She asked for my commitment to defend 
health care reform.
  The Affordable Care Act establishes a Pre-Existing Condition 
Insurance Plan--one that would provide new coverage options for 
Americans like Beth until 2014, when, finally, all discrimination 
against Americans with pre-existing conditions will be prohibited. 
Recently I also had the opportunity to speak with Susan, a mother of 
five from Rhode Island. Susan and her husband Ed are both middle-income 
earners. Recently their two sons, age 22 and 23, graduated from 
college. Both sons found entry level work, but neither receives health 
insurance from their employers. Under the current law, both sons will 
be eligible for coverage under their mother's health insurance plan 
when it renews in eight months. Susan went on to tell me that it would 
cost her more than $600 per month to provide coverage to her sons 
through COBRA. She said that with three children still at home, and 
despite the fact her and her husband are employed, they cannot support 
the added expense beyond eight months.
  With repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the temporary gap that Susan 
and her family face would become a permanent gap. We are sending a 
deplorable message to Americans, and indeed the world, if we abandon 
hard working men and woman like Susan and Ed, and let their two sons--
both college graduates, both duly employed, go without health coverage 
until they find jobs that provide health insurance.
  I come to this Congress to help bring common sense solutions to 
complex problems. When I look at the impact of repealing the Affordable 
Care Act, I think about the struggles of Alex, Beth and Susan, Ed and 
their two sons. I think about the number of Rhode Islanders who will 
once again find themselves saddled with greater financial burdens. I 
think about the many men, women, and children of my state who will once 
again face uncertainty over something as fundamental as their own 
health and well-being. When I think about these consequences, it is 
common sense, and an understanding of the struggles faced by so many 
Rhode Islanders that compels me to object so strongly to this proposed 
repeal.
  I was sent here to find practical solutions to solve the problems 
facing Rhode Island families. Let's work to improve this law, not 
repeal it.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to take a moment to recognize 
our Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives who last week 
cast the 50th vote in their effort to dismantle the Affordable Care 
Act--their 50th. I know it is a tradition to give gold in celebration 
of a 50th milestone. I instead would like to gift my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle with a reality check.
  More specifically, today I would like to talk about a certain group 
of people who arguably stand to lose if their antics continue. So I 
have come to the floor this afternoon to set the record straight on the 
Affordable Care Act and how it is working for women in America. It is 
not much of a stretch for me to say the Affordable Care Act is probably 
one of the most significant pieces of legislation for women in my 
lifetime. Not because of the battles we fought to get it to the 
President's desk, not necessarily because of the size or scope of the 
law, but because of the tangible and positive impact it has had and 
will continue to have on the health and well being of women in America.
  Four years ago health insurance companies could deny women care due 
to so-called preexisting conditions such as pregnancy or being a victim 
of domestic violence. Four years ago women were permitted to be legally 
discriminated against when it came to insurance premiums and were often 
paying more for coverage than men. Four years ago women did not have 
access to the full range of recommended preventive care, such as 
mammograms and prenatal screenings and more. Four years ago the 
insurance companies had all the leverage. Four years ago too often 
women were the ones who were paying the price. That is why I am proud 
today to highlight just how far we have come for women in the past 4 
years.
  Since the Affordable Care Act became law, women have been treated 
fairly with increased access to affordable health insurance, benefits, 
and services. Deductibles and other expenses have been capped so a 
health care crisis does not cause a family to lose their home or their 
life savings.
  Women can use the health care marketplaces to pick quality plans that 
work for them and their families. If they change jobs or have to move, 
they are able to keep their coverage. Starting in 2012, we saw these 
benefits for women expand even further. Additional types of maternity 
are now covered. Women are now armed with proper tools and resources in 
order to take the right steps to have a healthy pregnancy.
  Women now have access to domestic partner violence screening and 
counseling, as well as screening for sexually transmitted infections. 
Now women finally have access to affordable birth control. As public 
servants here, it is our job to help our constituents access Federal 
benefits available to them, particularly when it comes to health care. 
Since 80 percent of women are not only making health care choices for 
themselves but also their families and loved ones, it is our 
responsibility to serve as a guide when it comes to understanding how 
to best access these benefits.
  It might mean putting them in touch with a navigator to ensure they 
are getting the most affordable health insurance available or making 
them aware of an enrollment event where they can get information on 
available coverage options. But our responsibilities do not end there. 
It is our job to have an open, honest discussion about what the 
Affordable Care Act means for our constituents and to talk about ways 
to responsibly improve it.
  Instead, as we saw in the House last week, others have spent the 
better part of the last 4 years trying to take away the critical 
benefits that I just talked about, trying to score cheap political 
points on an issue that can literally mean the difference between life 
and death. I can understand why some of our colleagues disagree with 
certain parts of this law or maybe how it was implemented, but what I 
cannot understand is why anyone elected to Congress would decide to 
simply ignore real life stories of their own constituents whose lives 
were changed the day this law took effect.
  It is people like Susan Wellman. She lives in Bellingham in my home 
State of Washington. She is self employed. She has had to pay for 
individual insurance. Every year she has watched her health care costs 
rise higher and higher. It got to the point where she was

[[Page S1503]]

paying $300 monthly premiums with an $8,000 deductible, all for a plan 
she described as ``paying for nothing.''
  So as soon as Susan could access health care through the Washington 
State health care exchange, she jumped at the chance. She spoke on the 
phone with a real live person. She was able to sign up for an 
affordable plan in a matter of minutes. Now Susan is on a plan that 
costs her $125 a month instead of $300. It is a plan that has a $2,000 
deductible that actually pays for things. Guess what. She can afford to 
go to the doctor, not just in the case of an emergency but for a 
physical or a mammogram that could save her life, not to mention 
thousands and thousands of dollars in health care costs.
  That kind of preventive care is good for women like Susan. It is good 
for her family, and it is good for this country because when more 
people have access to preventive care, it makes health care cheaper for 
every single one of us.
  It is also good for women like Carrie Little. She is a certified 
organic farmer who lives in Orting, WA. A few weeks ago she was working 
outside when one of the rams on her farm attacked her, leaving her with 
bruises and a broken leg. Fortunately, because of her new health plan, 
her visit to the emergency room was painless. Well, as painless as it 
could be with a broken leg. But her hospital bills, her cast, and her 
visits to the orthopedic physician were paid in full.

  Until last year, Carrie had been spending half of her income for a 
catastrophic-only health plan, forcing her to pay out of pocket for 
even the most basic of care. Carrie wrote an op-ed, and I want to quote 
from it. She said:

       What a welcome relief that my new health plan covers 
     preventive care, like mammograms, immunizations, and yearly 
     doctor visits. I can keep the primary care doctor I have been 
     seeing for years. And I no longer worry about family members 
     getting kicked around due to pre-existing conditions. Thank 
     goodness. In agriculture, profits and losses shift like the 
     weather, so for our community, it is crucial that health 
     premiums stay affordable.

  Or women like Ingrid Gordon. Ingrid is a small business owner from 
Seattle who immediately enrolled in coverage when it became available. 
After an hour on the Web site, she told us, with minimal technical 
difficulties, Ingrid was enrolled and received her insurance card in 
the mail a few days later. Since her coverage began on January 1, 
Ingrid had her first dental and physical exams in 14 years. She cured a 
skin disorder thanks to prescription medicine. She scheduled a 
colonoscopy now that she is 50, and finally had her bothersome knee x-
rayed.
  All of those exams, visits and prescriptions would have cost Ingrid 
thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket just 1 year 
ago. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Ingrid paid a grand total 
of zero dollars in copays.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women like Susan and Carrie and 
Ingrid are now fully in charge of their own health care, not their 
insurance company. That is why I feel so strongly that we cannot go 
back to the way things were. While we can never stop working to make 
improvements, of course, we owe it to the women of America to make 
progress and not allow the clock to be rolled back on their health care 
needs.
  As we all know, unfortunately, there are efforts underway all across 
the country, including here in our Nation's capital, to severely 
undermine a woman's access to some of the most critical and life-saving 
services that are provided by the Affordable Care Act. No provision of 
this law has faced quite as much scrutiny as the idea of providing 
affordable, quality reproductive health services to the women of 
America.
  We have seen attempt after attempt to eliminate access to abortion 
services and low-cost birth control all while restricting a woman's 
ability to make personal decisions about her own care. I guess we 
should not be surprised. The truth is that the tide of these 
politically driven, extreme efforts continues to rise.
  In 2013 our Nation saw yet another record-breaking year of State 
legislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women's access to 
reproductive services. In fact, in the past 3 years the United States 
has enacted more of these restrictions than in the previous 10 years 
combined. That means that now more than ever, it is our job to protect 
these kinds of decisions for women, to fight for women's health, and to 
ensure that women's health does not become a political football.
  For this reason I was very proud to lead members of my caucus in 
filing a brief with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case 
of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., where a secular corporation 
and its shareholders are trying to get in between a woman and her 
health.
  Just like the many attempts before this case, there are those out 
there who would like the American public to believe that this 
conversation is anything but an attack on women's health care. To them 
it is a debate about freedom, except of course freedom for a woman to 
access her own care. It is no different than when we are told that a 
tax on abortion rights is not an infringement on a woman's right to 
choose; they are about religion or State's rights; or when we are told 
that restricting emergency contraception is not about limiting a 
woman's ability to make her own family planning decisions; it is about 
protecting pharmacists; or just like last week, when an Alaskan State 
Senator said he did not think there was a compelling reason for the 
government ``to finance other people's recreation.'' That was in 
reference, of course, to contraception coverage in health care. In 
fact, after doing some research, this State Senator concluded that 
since birth control costs about ``four or five lattes'' the government 
should really have no reason to cover this cost to women.
  The truth is that this is about contraception. This is an attempt to 
limit a woman's ability to access her own health care. This is about 
women. Allowing a woman's boss to call the shots about her access to 
birth control should be inconceivable to all Americans in this day and 
age, and it would take us back to a place in history when women had no 
voice and no choice.
  In fact, contraception was included as a required preventive service 
in the Affordable Care Act on the recommendation of an independent, 
nonprofit institute of medicine and other medical experts because it is 
essential to the health of women and families.
  After many years of research, we know ensuring access to effective 
birth control has a direct impact on improving the lives of women and 
their families in America. We have been able to directly link it to 
declines in maternal and infant mortality, reduced risk of ovarian 
cancer, better overall health outcomes for women, and far fewer 
unintended pregnancies and abortions, which is a goal we all should 
share.
  But what is at stake in this case now before the Supreme Court is 
whether a CEO's personal beliefs can trump a woman's right to access 
free or low-cost contraception under the Affordable Care Act.
  Every American deserves to have access to high-quality health care 
coverage, regardless of where they work. Each of us should have the 
right to make our own medical and religious decisions without being 
dictated to or limited by our employers. Contraceptive coverage is 
supported by the vast majority of Americans who understand how 
important it is for women and their families.
  In weighing this case, my hope is that the Court realizes women 
working for private companies should be afforded the same access to 
medical care regardless of who signs their paychecks. We can't allow 
for-profit secular corporations or their shareholders to deny female 
employees access to comprehensive women's health care under the guise 
of religious exemption. It is as if we are saying: Because you are a 
CEO or a shareholder in a corporation, your rights are more important 
than your employees', who happen to be women. That is a slippery slope 
that could lead to employers cutting off coverage for childhood 
immunizations if they object to that idea or prenatal care for children 
born to unmarried parents if they think it is wrong, or blocking an 
employee's ability to access HIV treatment.
  I was proud to be joined in filing the brief by 18 other Senators who 
were here when Congress enacted the religious protections under the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 and who were also here when 
Congress made access to women's health care available under the 
Affordable Care Act of 2010. They are Senators who

[[Page S1504]]

know Congress did not intend for a corporation or, furthermore, its 
shareholders to restrict a woman's access to preventive health care.
  In the coming weeks, as the Supreme Court prepares to begin oral 
arguments in this case, these Senators and our colleagues who support 
these efforts will echo those sentiments, because we all know that 
improving access to birth control is good health policy and good 
economic policy. It means healthier women, healthier children, 
healthier families, and it will save monies for our businesses and 
consumers.
  I know many of our colleagues here believe that repealing the 
Affordable Care Act and access to reproductive health services is a 
political winner for them. But the truth is this law and these 
provisions are a winner for women, for men, for our children, and our 
health care system overall.
  I am very proud to stand with my colleagues who are committed to 
making sure the benefits of this law don't get taken away from the 
women of America, because politics and ideology should not matter when 
it comes to making sure women get the care they need at a cost they can 
afford.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.

             THE COMING EFFECTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Salmon). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the House leadership for allowing 
me to utilize this hour to talk about some of the coming effects of the 
Affordable Care Act.


                           The Boston Tragedy

  Mr. BURGESS. First, I do want to take a moment and join with so many 
of my colleagues who have just spoken on the floor in acknowledging the 
sacrifices that were made by first responders, people who ran toward 
the sound of the destruction this afternoon in Boston; and I certainly 
would recognize that even now, at this late hour, doctors and nurses 
are working in the emergency rooms in Boston to try to provide comfort 
to the afflicted and save life and limb for those who were damaged this 
afternoon, an act so astonishing in its cruelty, it is difficult to 
comprehend.
  Mr. Speaker, in 5\1/2\ short months from right now, October 1, 2013, 
the full effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are 
going to start to be felt around the country. It's important that we 
take a few moments this evening and think about the road ahead, think 
about the things that are supposed to come online on October 1, and 
think about the contingencies if those things are not able to be 
accomplished.
  It was just a few weeks ago in this town when speaking to the 
American

[[Page H2014]]

Health Insurance group, one of the information technologists from 
Health and Human Services talked about this informational hub that is 
supposed to be developed by the Department of Health and Human 
Services, this informational hub that will allow people to go online to 
sign up for their benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The comments 
of this individual were quite revealing. Speaking to an AHIP group 
earlier this year, he said:

       The time for debating about the size of the text on the 
     screen or the color or whether it's a world-class user 
     experience, that's what we used to talk about 2 years ago. 
     Now let's just make sure it's not a Third World experience.

  That's a pretty sobering admission from someone who is charged with 
providing the information hub, the information technology, the computer 
architecture that is supposed to be the underpinnings of the Affordable 
Care Act.
  Bear in mind, it was 3 years ago, March of 2010, that the Affordable 
Care Act was signed into law. So 3 years later, billions of dollars 
spent in the implementation phase, and they're not sure if they can get 
this computer system up and running by October 1, which, by law, is 
when it is supposed to kick in.

                              {time}  1930

  That is a pretty significant admission from the information architect 
at the Department of Health and Human Services.
  Now, when Barry Cohen, who is the head of the Center for Consumer 
Information and Insurance Oversight in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, was addressing the same group in response to a 
question, he was a little bit unclear as to whether or not they would 
be, in fact, ready on that October 1 deadline.
  He said:

       We'll have to wait. Then we'll be in a position to know 
     which contingency plans we actually have to implement.

  In other words, we can't plan for the contingency until we get there 
and see that a contingency plan is necessary. But, after all, what are 
contingency plans but those plans that are put in place because 
something unexpected may happen?
  Last week, on the other side of the Capitol, in the other body, the 
Senator from West Virginia said:

       ObamaCare is so complicated, and if it isn't done right the 
     first time, it will just simply get worse.

  That's a pretty startling pronouncement from someone who was, in 
fact, a pretty big cheerleader for the Affordable Care Act when it went 
through the Senate.
  He went on to say:

       I believe that the Affordable Care Act is probably the most 
     complex piece of legislation ever passed by the United States 
     Congress. Tax reform has obviously been huge, too, but up to 
     this point, this--the Affordable Care Act--is just beyond 
     comprehension.

  Now, what does the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services have to say about all of this? She maintains that the 
Affordable Care Act will lower the cost of premiums for everyone; but 
in fact, in the past couple of weeks, she has admitted:

       These folks will be moving into a really fully insured 
     product for the first time, and so there may be a higher cost 
     associated with getting into that market.

  Translation: you're going to be paying more.
  She goes on to say:

       Some men and some younger customers could see their rates 
     increase. Women and older customers could see their rates 
     drop.

  So, Mr. Speaker, I would submit that the coming rate shock is 
something for which people are actually unprepared. They have been told 
for 3 years that, after all, this is the Affordable Care Act, and it's 
going to make health care more affordable for all Americans; but the 
reality is somewhat different from the truth that is espoused by the 
Department of Health and Human Services.
  Let's think about some of these things for just a minute, because 
they are important. Remember when the Affordable Care Act was debated? 
Remember the President's discussing the Affordable Care Act? Everyone 
wanted to talk about patients with preexisting conditions: patients 
with preexisting conditions are frozen out of the system; patients with 
preexisting conditions can't get care. Well, they meant couldn't get 
insurance, because people can get care. Nevertheless, this was proposed 
as an enormous problem. The Affordable Care Act was going to fix it.
  How did the Affordable Care Act fix it?
  Next year, when the exchanges are up and running or when Medicaid is 
expanded, people, indeed, may be incorporated into that system. Until 
that day arrives, they were to be taken care of through what is known 
as the Preexisting Condition Insurance Program, or PCIP, which is the 
Federal preexisting risk pool that was set up for the first time under 
the Affordable Care Act. Five billion dollars was put forward to help 
people with preexisting conditions with their premiums. Now, there was 
a little bit of a barrier to entry. You had to be uninsured for 6 
months' time before you would be eligible for coverage under the 
preexisting condition program.
  I've got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I thought the Supreme Court was 
going to knock this thing out of the water. I thought there was no way 
in the world the highest court of the land could look at this thing and 
agree that it is constitutional under the Commerce Clause; that is, you 
can compel commerce in order to regulate it. I just knew that that day 
when the Supreme Court ruled that they would agree with me. In fact, 
they did; but then they went on to say that, in fact, since it's all a 
tax, Congress has the power to tax, and for that reason, it's not 
unconstitutional, and the law was allowed to stand.
  Leading up to that day that the Supreme Court made that 
pronouncement, I was so convinced that we as Members of Congress had an 
obligation to our constituents--to people who were, in fact, thinking 
that they were covered under the Affordable Care Act--to provide a 
contingency plan, particularly for those people who were covered under 
this new Federal preexisting condition insurance plan. Well, it turns 
out I wasn't right, and the law was constitutional.
  But what would have happened last June 30 if the Supreme Court had 
said that it was unconstitutional, and the whole thing was struck down? 
As a consequence, people who were in the preexisting condition program 
would have found themselves without insurance, and that would have been 
a pretty significant event to have occurred. I felt that we needed to 
have a contingency plan to cover those individuals.
  Now here we are some 6, 8 months later; and what happened in January 
of this year? The PCIP program ran out of money. It ran out of money at 
the end of January, and they said, We're not taking any more people 
into this program.
  We had a hearing a couple of weeks ago in the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce and heard from a patient who had thought she was in the queue, 
in that waiting period, to get into the Federal preexisting condition 
program except that they suspended enrollment at the end of January. 
You've got to believe that there were a lot of people who were in that 
6-month waiting period who were waiting for their time to come up so 
that they could, in fact, enroll in this preexisting condition program; 
but as of the end of January, they were shut out. So the committee 
wrote a letter to the President that said, We'd like to help you here. 
There are probably other moneys in the Affordable Care Act that can be 
moved around and can continue to cover these individuals until January 
1 of 2014 when the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion and all of the 
goodies prescribed in the Affordable Care Act can come on line.
  One of the things that we were told in leading up to the passage of 
the Affordable Care Act is that there were millions of people who fell 
into this preexisting condition trap. In fact, on the floor of the 
House, you heard people quote figures of 8 to 12 million people. The 
Speaker of the House at that time, Speaker Pelosi, said 125 million 
people had preexisting conditions. In fact, that was a little bit of a 
misnomer because, when you look at the people who are covered by 
insurance in this country, the vast majority is covered under what's 
called a ``large group plan,'' or what we know as ``employer-sponsored 
insurance.'' A preexisting condition exclusion can occur in that 
environment, but it's much, much rarer, and there are typically open 
enrollment periods in which a person can

[[Page H2015]]

get taken on to his employer's insurance. Now, for 65 percent of the 
population, that's not the issue. Certainly, for people in the small 
group market and in the individual market, in the small group market 
and in the individual market, there was a problem.

  On the numbers that people quoted prior to the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act--8 million, 10 million, 12 million people--how many 
people were in the Federal preexisting condition program at the end of 
June when I worried that the Supreme Court was going to strike the 
whole thing down?
  There were 65,000 people and certainly every one of those individuals 
with a compelling story--and not a small population but a manageable 
population. If we are just talking about trying to correct a problem 
for 65,000 people in a country of 310 million, I would submit that we 
can do that without destroying the existing program, the employer-
sponsored insurance, that people said they liked and wanted to keep.
  Remember, if you like what you have, you can keep it?
  Instead of taking care of a problem for a relatively finite but 
compelling population, the administration and, at the time, the 
congressional Democrats pushed through a bill of ``we just want to 
control everything about your health care.'' They got their wish, but 
now we had probably 100,000 people in January who were in the Federal 
preexisting condition program, and now no new people can sign up for it 
because it is going to run out of money.
  Mr. Speaker, I would submit that there is other money available in 
things like, we call them, ``slush funds'' that were built into the 
Affordable Care Act; things like the Medicare Modernization Act; things 
like the fund that is to allow for other activities in the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services. So, by just shifting some money around, 
these people who have preexisting conditions, in fact, could be taken 
care of, and we have the ability to do that. Really, it would be a 
relatively easy lift at this point, and perhaps next week we'll see 
legislation on the floor.
  Can you imagine if this had been a Republican President who had taken 
people off the Federal preexisting condition program? You would have 
heard about it from every newspaper in the country, and every 
television outlet in the country would have talked about it. How much 
did you hear? Well, you're probably hearing about it tonight for the 
first time. You'll hear about it a little bit more next week. People 
don't want to talk about the failures embedded in the Affordable Care 
Act, but it is important that we do so.

                              {time}  1940

  Now, when this bill was passed into law, March of 2010, the then-
Speaker of the House, Speaker Pelosi, claimed that the Affordable Care 
Act would create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately. Well, 
that hasn't turned out to be exactly true, either.
  The Federal Reserve reported that employers are citing the 
uncertainty embedded in the Affordable Care Act as reasons for layoffs 
in companies and the reluctance to hire new employees.
  The application that was proposed by the Department of Health and 
Human Services for people to fill out to get coverage in the exchanges 
next year actually asks an applicant if their job is no longer offering 
health coverage in the next year. Clearly embedded in the Affordable 
Care Act was a risk to job creation in this country, and we're now 
seeing that actually come into being.
  The law does not treat everyone the same. It creates essentially a 
new underclass. It promises universal coverage, but it leaves some 
workers' families without coverage. Now, one of the most significant 
embedded problems in the Affordable Care Act is if an individual is 
working and their employer is providing them employer-sponsored 
insurance, that employer is required to do that; or if that employee 
looks for coverage in the exchange, that employer may be fined. But if 
the employer provides that employer-sponsored insurance, great. But he 
doesn't have to apply it, he doesn't have to provide that insurance to 
their family. This is a significant problem because that family, which 
right now may be covered, next year may not.
  But here's the other part of that. That family would not be eligible 
for a subsidy in the insurance exchange because the employer is 
providing the benefit to the employee, but there was nothing in the law 
that said they had to continue family coverage. So who is going to be 
affected, primarily women and children. A headline in the Fort Worth 
Star Telegram a few weeks ago, and the Fort Worth Star Telegram is 
generally supportive of the administration and generally supportive of 
the Affordable Care Act, but under their headline was, ``500,000 
Children to Lose Health Benefits Under the Affordable Care Act.''
  This was actually not through something that was revealed in the 
Department of Health and Human Services, but rather a rule that was 
proposed by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue 
Service. It turns out that children who lose insurance because the 
primary employee will be covered but the family will not, those 
children who lose insurance will not be fined by the IRS for not 
complying with the insurance mandate; but that is scant consolation for 
the fact that now they have no insurance and they have no reasonable 
way of achieving that because, after all, the cost for insurance is 
going to significantly increase under the Affordable Care Act.
  There is a 21-page application for Americans who feel that they 
should be covered under the Medicaid expansion. A 21-page application 
is pretty significant. It does ask some questions that you have to ask 
yourself, are they germane to someone who is applying for health 
insurance. But nevertheless, the application is out there. It's in the 
public domain, albeit it's a draft at this point. My hope is that the 
Department of Health and Human Services will refine that, but most of 
the 27- to 35-year-olds that I know are not going to spend a lot of 
time filling out a 21-page application.
  We were told in the run-up to the passage of this law that it would, 
in fact, pay down the deficit. It was $142 billion over 10 years, but 
it was supposed to reduce the deficit. Does anybody really believe that 
anymore? Of course not. And now the further evaluation of the costs and 
the expansive costs that are going to occur under the Affordable Care 
Act, probably an additional $1.5 trillion, at a conservative estimate, 
as to what this will add to the deficit over the next 10 years, and 
this is just for the subsidies and the exchanges and for the Medicaid 
expansion alone.
  Now, why does that matter? Mr. Speaker, it matters because in just a 
few short weeks, the statutory borrowing authority of the United States 
will be met or exceeded. And this Congress, this House, will once again 
be involved in another discussion about raising the debt limit. In July 
of 2011, we had this discussion. It was pretty acrimonious and 
attracted a lot of attention and a lot of publicity, none of it good. 
We're going to have that same fight occur again.
  A lot of people are concerned about the sequester. They say, we wish 
the sequester had never happened. But remember, the sequester was what 
the President proposed in order to get the expansion of the debt limit 
to a point where he would not have to deal with it again until after 
election day 2012. So the President got his wish. He said the sequester 
was good; it will allow us to get past this point and to move on. But 
now people are dealing with the aftermath.
  I would just ask you, what is the sequester going to look like in the 
summer of 2013, because the debt limit will not be just expanded to 
cover the obligations. There is going to have to be some spending 
discipline that goes along with that. I don't know what that will be. 
I'm not privy to those discussions, but will all the money that is 
promised to be there for the Medicaid expansion, for the subsidies in 
the exchange, will it in fact be there, or will that be exposed to some 
type of sequester-type device? I don't know the answer to that 
question, but those are questions in which this House will have to deal 
in literally a few short weeks' time.

  There has been significant tax policy that has gone into effect since 
the Affordable Care Act was passed. Just this year, five new taxes--
significant taxes--have occurred, as a result of the Affordable Care 
Act. There's a payroll tax that has increased almost 1 percent, 0.9 
percent.

[[Page H2016]]

  A payroll tax for people who earn over $200,000 a year, joint filers 
of $250,000 a year, some people look at that and say we knew that 
Medicare was getting into trouble. Maybe that is a good thing that that 
payroll tax for Medicare has gone up. Well, it might be except the 
money doesn't stay in the Medicare trust fund. It's collected, and then 
it immediately goes into the general revenue in order to pay for or 
offset the cost of the subsidies that are going to exist in the 
insurance exchange.
  One of the more onerous taxes that was begun on January 1 was a 2.4 
percent gross receipts tax on medical devices. Class II and class III 
medical devices as defined by the Food and Drug Administration are now 
subject to a 2.4 percent gross receipts tax. That's not a tax on 
profits; that's a tax on gross sales. It is significant. Sure, there 
are some big companies that will make due; but really it's the small 
entrepreneur who is developing medical devices, and this is happening 
all the time. Those individuals are the ones who are going to be 
particularly hard hit. And, as you can imagine, it may reduce some of 
that entrepreneurial activity or send it overseas.
  We already have a Food and Drug Administration that's sometimes 
difficult to deal with as far as getting things approved. Europe and 
Central Asia are not so difficult to deal with. And, hey, by the way, 
there's not that gross receipts tax. Perhaps we ought to move our 
manufacturing somewhere else. And, of course, the jobs go with the 
manufacturing.
  There's been a change in what are called flexible spending accounts. 
Flexible spending accounts are that money which you are able to 
designate at the beginning of every calendar year, and you can have 
pretax dollars that can be spent for recurrent medical expenses.
  This now has been capped at $2,500 a year. The amount was much higher 
previously; but under the Affordable Care Act, in order to offset some 
of the additional costs of the Affordable Care Act, they said we're 
going to cap those flexible spending account contributions to $2,500. 
That started this year.
  So if you've got a recurring medical expense that occurs every year, 
and think about someone with a family member who has a chronic medical 
condition or a family with a special needs child where they wanted to 
be able to set some dollars aside at the beginning of the year, not 
have them taxed so that they could pay for whatever it was that was 
going to be required, they are now capped at $2,500. People are going 
to very quickly find that amount is exceeded, and that they have been 
caught in this so-called FSA trap, or flexible spending account trap.
  For people who deduct medical expenses from their income tax, and as 
you know, currently for the last tax year for which we all just 
prepared our taxes and filed them this evening, there was a 7.5 percent 
exclusion from your adjusted gross income, that is, until your medical 
expenses equaled 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, you didn't 
get to deduct medical expenses from your tax. That amount has actually 
increased to 10 percent for next year. So people who were accustomed, 
people with a lot of medical expenses who were accustomed to keeping up 
with those receipts and then being able to deduct those medical 
expenses as they exceeded 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income, 
they're now not going to be able to deduct those expenses until after 
10 percent of their adjusted gross income.

                              {time}  1950

  So who have we punished here?
  We have punished the families with special needs children. We have 
punished people with chronic medical conditions. We've basically gone 
after the sickest Americans to say you're going to pay a little bit 
more for what everyone else is going to receive in the Affordable Care 
Act.
  There is going to be a tax on insurance companies--I'm sorry--a tax 
on insurance policies that people will have to pay. This will go into a 
couple of different accounts, a couple of different funds, but the 
bottom line is it costs more every year to buy your insurance.
  And then, beginning in 2018, the so-called tax on Cadillac insurance 
plans kicks in. And who's this going to affect?
  Well, yes, it will affect higher-income earners who get a generous 
insurance policy. But it also affects union members whose insurance 
policies were part of their collective bargaining agreements over time, 
and those policies which now are going to be judged to be Cadillac 
plans will actually be taxed at a much higher rate starting in 2018.
  There was supposed to be an exchange set up for small business. It 
was called the SHOP Exchange, small business health policies. Twenty-
nine times there were deadlines that were missed in setting up the SHOP 
exchanges. And now, just in the past couple of weeks, the Department of 
Health and Human Services said, it's pretty tough, pretty complicated. 
We don't know if we can do it or not, but we're giving ourselves 
another year. This won't happen until 2015.
  I think this is one of the things that really caused some of the 
consternation over in the Senate because in the other body this was one 
of the deals that they made in order to get the Affordable Care Act 
passed, in order to get it to the floor of the Senate in the fall of 
2009.
  It is instructive for people to remember how this thing came to be in 
the first place. Now, in the summer of 2009, the committees of 
jurisdiction here in the House--Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, 
Education and Labor--all debated a version of the House health care 
reform bill.
  Now, make no mistake about it. I think it was a crummy bill. H.R. 
3200 was the number. It did go through the committee process. It was 
amended several times in the various House committees. From there it 
went to the Speaker's desk, where it was all kind of consolidated; all 
three committee products were kind of melded into one, and then it came 
to the floor of the House, doubled in size, during that 2- or 3-month 
hiatus, and was passed by the House of Representatives in the fall, in 
November of 2009.
  Not a single--well, one Republican vote, and the rest carried by 
Democrats. Thirty-five Democrats voted against it because of some of 
the problems contained within that legislation.
  But the important thing is, as bad as I think it is, it did go 
through the regular House process. We may have been curtailed in the 
number of amendments we could offer in committee. Our time for debate 
in committee may have been limited but, nevertheless, it did come 
through the committee process.
  Not so in the Senate. H.R. 3200 has never been seen or heard from 
again. It passed the House, went over to the Senate to await activity, 
and there it went, up into the ether somewhere. No one really knows 
what happened to it.
  But, wait a minute. There's a health care law that was signed by the 
President in March of 2010. How did the health care law come into 
being?
  Well, the House had passed another bill in July of 2009. It was H.R. 
3590, dealt with housing. I think it passed the House with very few 
negative votes. But it was a housing bill.

  It went over to the Senate to await further activity, and that's the 
bill that was picked up by Senate leadership that was brought to the 
floor of the Senate and amended. The amendment read ``strike all after 
the enacting clause and insert,'' striking, of course, the language for 
the housing bill, which was the base bill, and inserting health care 
language, and that was the bill that the Senate passed late on 
Christmas Eve in 2009, right ahead of a big snowstorm that was coming 
to town.
  All the Senators wanted to get out so they passed this bill. Sixty 
votes. Not a single Republican vote. Passed with entirely Democratic 
votes.
  Now, under normal circumstances, H.R. 3590, which was now the Senate 
health care bill, and H.R. 3200, which was the House bill, would have 
gone to a conference committee. They would have worked rough edges out. 
They would have worked the differences out between the two bills, and a 
conference report would have come back to both Houses of Congress, the 
House and the Senate, and that would have been voted on, up or down.
  The problem was that, remember, it took 60 votes to pass it on the 
Senate side. Shortly after H.R. 3590 passed on the Senate side, a 
Democratic seat was lost. Scott Brown was elected from Massachusetts 
and, as a consequence, that 60th vote was no longer available to the 
Democratic leadership in the Senate.

[[Page H2017]]

  So what are they going to do?
  Well, they said that the House will just simply have to pass H.R. 
3590. After all, it was a House bill that was passed already by the 
House in July of 2009, amended by the Senate, to become a health care 
bill. All that is required for it to become law is for the House to 
take a vote; will the House now concur with the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 3590. So many as in favor, say aye.
  If that is a simple majority, 218 votes here in the House of 
Representatives, if that is a simple majority, then that's the end of 
the discussion. The bill goes down the street to the White House for a 
signing ceremony, and that's exactly what happened.
  Now, it took 3 months to accomplish that, because no one here in the 
House thought H.R. 3590 was a very good legislative product.
  In fact, let's be honest, Mr. Speaker. It was a rough draft that had 
been produced by the Senate Finance Committee, the staff of the Senate 
Finance Committee, as a vehicle to get the Senate to conference with 
the House. They never expected for this thing to be signed into law. It 
was a vehicle to get to a conference to then sit down with the House, 
and let's work out these differences between the two of us, and then 
we'll get a conference committee product to come to the floor. But it 
didn't work out.
  As a consequence, the bill that was signed into law was one that was 
never intended to become law. It was a product produced by the staff of 
the Senate Finance Committee as a vehicle to get them out of town 
before Christmas Eve so that they could then get to the conference 
committee where the real work, the real work of writing this health 
care law would occur.
  The American people were cheated by this process, Mr. Speaker. And 
now, we're left to deal with the consequences.
  And what are the consequences?
  500,000 children, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, being 
taken off their parents' employer-sponsored insurance. People in the 
preexisting program who had been waiting patiently for their turn are 
now told, we're sorry, it's full up. No more space. You can't come in.
  It didn't have to be this way. There were good ideas on both sides 
that could have been taken into account.
  One of the fundamental questions I think we have to ask ourselves 
over and over again is where were the country's Governors when this 
bill was actually written. Well, of course it was written by the Senate 
Finance Committee staff, so the Governors were nowhere in the room. A 
lot of deals that were struck between some of the special interest 
groups and the White House were all done down at the White House in 
July of 2009. The Nation's governors weren't involved in that.
  Why were the Nation's governors so reluctant to accept the exchanges, 
the Medicaid expansion?
  Well, the answer, Mr. Speaker, is because they were dealt out of the 
process. And then, the rulemaking that started happening after the law 
was signed began to scare them, but a lot of the rules were held until 
after Election Day.
  The rule governing essential health benefits--what Governor in their 
right mind is going to sign on to an exchange program where they don't 
even know what they're going to be required to cover? They don't know 
how much money it is going to cost them?
  Well, it's no surprise that 26 States said no dice to the exchange. 
An additional six States said maybe we'll do a partnership, but you go 
ahead and set the program up through the Federal level first.
  And as consequence, the Office of Personnel Management is now 
required to set up exchanges for 26 States, plus six that might want 
partnership, and that's a tall order, which is why Gary Cohen said, I'm 
not sure we're going to need a contingency plan, but we can't know what 
contingency we have until we actually get there.
  I will submit there is going to be a need for a contingency plan. The 
sooner that the agencies admit that to the appropriate committees in 
the House and Senate, the sooner they can begin to work on a solution 
for a problem.
  Because, Mr. Speaker, let's face it. January 1 of 2014, there's going 
to be an emergency room, there's going to be an operating room, there's 
going to be a delivery room where a patient and doctor are going to 
come in contact with each other, and they don't need the uncertainty of 
what this legislation has dealt them.
  I thank the Speaker for the time this evening, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to spend a few minutes talking 
about the Affordable Care Act. I wonder how many people on the 
Republican side today are going to talk about ObamaCare. If they do, 
they should be in a very positive state. We know that as a result of 
this bill, the Affordable Care Act, people are getting or soon will get 
a rebate. One of the things we did--led by Senator Franken and others--
was make sure that 80 percent of the money paid for premiums goes to 
patient care and any amount that doesn't has to be refunded to the 
patients. That is in the process now. In the month of August, all those 
moneys will come back in a significant amount to Americans who, in 
effect, are part of programs that spend too much on salaries for 
bosses.
  Also, we are going to talk a little bit today about what this 
Affordable Care Act does for women in America. As I said, I am going to 
speak very briefly, but we are going to have people come--as soon as I 
and the Republican leader finish--to talk about good things in this 
bill for women. I will touch on them very briefly.
  There is no question this bill that was signed by President Obama is 
a landmark piece of legislation. It signaled an end to insurance 
company discrimination among many but especially against those who are 
ill, those with a preexisting condition, and especially against women.
  As a result of this bill we passed, being a woman is no longer a 
preexisting disability in America. For many years, insurance companies 
charged American women higher premiums. Why? Because they are women. 
For years, American women have unfairly borne the burden of the high 
cost of contraception as well. Even women with private insurance often 
wind up spending hundreds of dollars more each year for birth control. 
Today, women of reproductive age spend two-thirds more out of their own 
pockets for health care costs than men, largely due to the high cost of 
birth control. But starting tomorrow--Wednesday of this week--new 
insurance plans must cover contraception and many other preventive 
health services for women. How much? No additional pay at all. Under 
health care reform, about 47 million women, including almost 400,000 
women in Nevada, will have guaranteed access to those additional 
preventive services without cost sharing.
  Many on the other side downplayed the importance of these benefits or 
fought to repeal them altogether. It is hard to comprehend but true. 
Forcing American women to continue struggling with the high price of 
contraception has very real consequences. Every year millions of women 
in the United States put off doctors' visits because they can't afford 
the copay and millions more skip pills or shots to save money.
  It is no mystery why the United States has one of the highest rates 
of unintended pregnancies of all industrialized nations. Half of all 
pregnancies in America are unplanned. Of those unintended pregnancies, 
about half wind up in abortion. Increasing access to contraception is 
the most effective way to reduce unintended pregnancies and reduce the 
number of abortions, but the high cost is often a barrier.
  That is why, in 1997, Olympia Snowe and I began a bipartisan effort 
to prevent unintended pregnancies by expanding access to contraception. 
It has not been an easy path, but we did make a start. As part of this 
effort, we helped pass a law ensuring Federal employees access to 
contraception. It was a big issue. That was 15 years ago or more. It is 
an issue that is still important, but we started it, and I am very 
happy about that. Olympia Snowe was terrific to work with.
  When this benefit took place in 1999, premiums did not go up one 
single dime because neither did health care costs--not one penny. It 
was rewarding to note that a pro-life Democrat and pro-choice 
Republican were able to confront the issue with a practical eye rather 
than a political eye. It is unfortunate that over the last 15 years an 
idea that started as a common-ground proposal has become so polarizing 
in Congress. The controversy is quite strange when we consider that 
almost 99 percent of women have relied on contraception at some point 
in their lives, and many have struggled to afford it. The Affordable 
Care Act will ensure that insurance companies treat women fairly and 
treat birth control as any other preventive service.
  Prior to Senator Snowe and me doing this, anything a man wanted they 
got. Viagra, fine; we will take care of that. Anything a man wanted 
they got--but not a woman. The law doesn't just guarantee women's 
access to contraception, it assures their access to many other 
lifesaving procedures as well.
  Thanks to the health care bill--the Affordable Care Act--insurance 
companies are already required to cover preventive care such as 
mammograms. For a person who is able to have a mammogram, it is 
lifesaving. Most people in the Senate know my wife is battling breast 
cancer. She had a mammogram in December and in August discovered a lump 
in her breast. Think of what would have happened if she had waited 1 
year because she couldn't afford that mammogram. Frankly, the thought 
of it is very hard for me to comprehend because even though she had 
that mammogram in December, she had found it and was in stage 3 of 
breast cancer. It has been very difficult. What if she waited an extra 
year? Many people wait a lot longer than an extra year.
  Colonoscopies save lives. I was talking to one of my friends in the 
Senate who is going to have his done. They do it every 5 years. It 
takes at least 10 years for polyps to develop into cancer, and some 
polyps develop into cancer if they are not taken out. People need to 
have this done.
  Blood pressure checks, childhood immunizations without cost sharing 
is part of what is in this bill. It used to be a bill; now it is the 
law.
  Starting tomorrow--again, Wednesday of this week--women will no 
longer have to reach in their pockets to pay for wellness checkups. 
They can do screening for diabetes, HPV testing, sexually transmitted 
infection counseling, HIV screening and counseling, breastfeeding 
support, domestic violence screening and counseling. That is all in the 
law starting tomorrow. All women in new insurance plans will have 
access to all forms of FDA-approved contraception without having to 
shell out more money on top of their premiums. Ending insurance company 
discrimination will help millions more women afford the care they need 
when they need it. It will restore basic fairness to the health care 
system. Sometimes the practical thing to do is also the right thing to 
do, and that is what the legislation we worked so hard to pass is all 
about. It is about doing the right thing for everyone. Today we are 
going to focus on women.

              DEFICIT SPENDING AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being recognized for the 
time, and I appreciate the recognition that this Chamber and my 
colleagues are putting on the issues before us.
  As we look at Federal spending, what we have to do is say: What is 
causing us to be in a position where we are borrowing $2 billion a day? 
And if we are borrowing $2 billion a day, we have to ask: Is that a 
sustainable practice and something that we as a Nation can continue? Of 
course the answer to that is, no, it is not sustainable. Therefore, we 
have to look at what is causing us to spend more money than we are 
taking in, and one of the things that is at the top of that list that 
is too expensive to afford is the ObamaCare program, the Affordable 
Care Act.
  What I would like to do today is focus my comments on what we are 
seeing from the Affordable Care Act and what has happened with the cost 
of this program and why it has become too expensive to afford and why 
we have to talk about it and focus on it and put it on the table as we 
talk about what our Nation spends.
  Now, we all remember supposedly ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, 
was going to be a $900 billion program, roughly, that was to give 
access to affordable health insurance for those who didn't have access 
to health insurance, but let's look at what has happened.
  This was the estimate: under a trillion dollars, $900 billion, when 
the program was passed. But, oh, remember, we had to pass it in order 
to read it to find out what was in it. After we read it the first time, 
$1.4 trillion. My source on this is the Congressional Budget Office, 
the CBO. Every time it has been reviewed, with some of the nearly 
13,000 pages of rules and regulations, guess what has happened? The 
cost estimate has gone up. Now ObamaCare is a $2.6 trillion program. So 
what we are looking at is a near tripling in cost before the program 
goes into effect. This is why we continue to say, as we look at fiscal 
health, fiscal restraint, you have to look at what is happening with 
the cost projections on ObamaCare.
  Now, for those of us from my State of Tennessee, this is something 
that is not new to us. We had the test case for HillaryCare in our 
State. It is called TennCare. What happened with the TennCare program 
was it ended up quadrupling in cost in a period of 5 years.
  Now, this causes us a little bit of concern because we look at what 
has happened with the cost of government-managed and -delivered health 
care services. Well, let's take a look at Medicare and where it was 
supposed to be in 1968 and then what has happened with its costs. You 
can look at these lines, the red line.
  These are on my Web site for our colleagues that would like to go and 
look at the Web site.
  You can see what happened in 1968, and the red line shows where it 
has grown to today. For something that was to end up being about $12 
billion a year, we are now spending over $400 billion a year on. You 
can see what were to be the projections here on this bottom line, and 
you see how far it has exceeded its projections. So because of this, we 
are quite concerned with the growth and the projections of growth for 
ObamaCare.
  Look at the track record of government spending. Do programs 
generally come in below their estimates? No. They generally exceed 
those estimates. So we continue to be very concerned about what will 
happen with the cost of ObamaCare and the impact this is going to have 
on our $3.5-trillion-a-year budget, and we continue to say: We have to 
review this; it is too expensive to afford; and does it fit into what 
the American taxpayer is willing to pay for?
  Because every penny we spend here in Washington, D.C., comes out of 
the taxpayers' pockets from money that they have earned and then have 
paid in taxes, sent to Washington, they expect us to be very careful 
stewards of those dollars.
  Before my time expires, Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out one 
other concern that we have with the exchanges and the way they are 
going to handle information. Six hundred million dollars to build a 
computer system that doesn't work and doesn't protect the

[[Page H6597]]

identity and the information of enrollees in the health care exchange 
is another of the problems there that is worthy of discussion of this 
program.

                 AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Tipton) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, let's begin with where we can all agree as 
Americans: at the very beginning of the debate when it came to health 
care in 2008, it was about affordability and accessibility when it 
comes to health care. We can't disagree about that. As Americans and 
small businessmen, we felt the pain of seeing ever-increasing premiums, 
but we also wanted to make sure that we had access to real doctors.
  What are the results that are now coming out of the Affordable Care 
Act? Let me give you an example that was just emailed to me last night 
out of a small community church in my district in Durango, Colorado. 
They were just able to extend their plan before the Affordable Care Act 
takes effect. For six employees working at the church, their premiums 
are now going to be $50,665 for the collective group this year. When 
the Affordable Care Act impacts them in the next cycle, those rates 
will rise for those same six employees to $72,069, a 48.7 percent 
increase.
  So the question we have to ask is: Has the Affordable Care Act 
achieved the goal that, as Americans, we can all agree that we desire 
to be able to have--affordability?
  Let's talk to those six people working in that small church in 
Durango, Colorado, who are relying on charitable contributions to be 
able to have their jobs, to have affordable health care. The answer is 
no.
  Let's talk to senior citizens that I visited with throughout the 
Third Congressional District of Colorado, many of whom just became 
senior citizens and are now required to sign up for Medicare under the 
law. Just because of a birthday over the last year or two, they are now 
finding that they cannot even find a doctor who will accept Medicare.
  I just held a meeting with better than 20 physicians in Grand 
Junction, Colorado, several of whom expressed that by the year 2014 
they're closing their practices. So have we addressed accessibility in 
America? We have not.
  What the administration fails to understand is there's a quantitative 
difference between affordability and accessibility and just having an 
insurance card. We can insure every American, but does that mean you 
have access to quality health care at an affordable price?
  The Republican Party is putting forward real solutions to be able to 
address this challenge. Let's let the free markets actually work. Let's 
have real competition. Let's allow businesses to be able to come 
together to be able to form real groups and to be able to negotiate 
lower rates. Let's incentivize rather than disincentivize, as the 
President's law does, those private medical health care savings 
accounts if we really care about health care. Let's, indeed, make sure 
that people with preexisting conditions have access and affordable 
health care as well.
  These are the plans that we are putting forward; but it's going to 
require that we work together. What is not helpful is when we hear an 
administration say it is nonnegotiable while at the same time saying we 
have to work together. We can't work together if we cannot have a 
dialogue. That is what this House of Representatives is putting 
forward--real solutions to be able to address the real problems to help 
real Americans that are struggling right now.
  And the bottom line is, if we want health care, we also need jobs. If 
you talk to the people in my district, small businesses, they aren't 
able to hire right now simply because of the cost of the Affordable 
Care Act and the impacts that they're feeling. These are affecting real 
Americans, real people, and real lives. The solution cannot and should 
not be just bigger government, just a legacy piece of legislation.
  I believe that the American people deserve a policy that will 
actually work for them. That can only be achieved if we work together. 
We are putting those ideas forward today. We are not about shutting 
down this government. We want to keep it open. That's the policy of our 
conference. But we also need to have a policy that's making sure that 
government laws are not hurting the American people. The Affordable 
Care Act is hurting the American people, will hurt the economy, will 
hurt jobs.

[[Page H5934]]

  This is something that we can achieve a positive solution on if the 
administration will open that door to dialogue rather than distrust. 
Let's work for the American people rather than for bigger government.

                    AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ANNIVERSARY

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this Saturday marks the third 
anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act. At age 3, the 
law is protecting consumers against abusive insurance practices, 
helping seniors by lowering prescription drug costs, and building the 
infrastructure to expand health insurance coverage to millions of 
Americans. For the first time, patients' interests and needs are being 
put ahead of those of the insurance and drug companies.
  The Obama administration has worked tirelessly to implement the law, 
in the face of constant opposition. My Republican colleagues in 
Congress have voted to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act well 
over 30 times. It is a chilling, if useless, political refrain from the 
tea party.
  On this third anniversary, it is important not only to reflect on how 
far we have come but to continue pressing forward on the Affordable 
Care Act's many improvements to our health care system, particularly 
the delivery system reforms.
  The Council of Economic Advisers' 2013 ``Economic Report of the 
President'' identified a number of sources of waste in our health care 
system, including the fragmentation of the delivery system; duplicate 
care and overtreatment; the failure of providers to adopt best 
practices; and payment fraud. The council notes:

       Taken together, [these factors] have been estimated to 
     account for between 13 and 26 percent of national health 
     expenditures in 2011. The magnitude of this waste offers an 
     equally large opportunity for spending reductions and 
     improvement in quality of care an opportunity that underpins 
     many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

  Thankfully, we have the tools necessary to seize the opportunity 
described by the Council of Economic Advisers to drive down costs and 
improve the quality of patient care. The Affordable Care Act included 
45 provisions dedicated to improving the way we deliver health care in 
5 priority areas: payment reform, primary and preventive care, 
measuring and reporting quality, administrative simplification, and 
health information technology.
  The effort to extract from the wasteful swamp of our health care 
bureaucracy a lean, humane, patient-centered system is vital. National 
health spending hit $2.7 trillion in 2011 or about 18 percent of GDP. 
The next least efficient developed country--the Netherlands--spent 12 
percent of its GDP on health care in 2010. Germany and France spent 
11.6 percent of their GDP on health care. If we were as efficient as 
the Netherlands, if we merely moved from last place to second-to-last 
place in health care efficiency, we would save over $800 billion per 
year.
  For all of our excess spending, one might expect that Americans live 
longer, healthier lives. But that is not the case. The Institute of 
Medicine recently compared the United States to 17 peer countries. We 
were worst for prevalence of diabetes among adults, worst for obesity 
across all age groups, and worst in infant mortality. We suffer higher 
death rates and worse outcomes for conditions such as heart disease and 
chronic lung disease.
  According to the Week, avoidable infections passed on due to poor 
hospital hygiene kill as many people in the United States--about 
103,000 a year--as AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents combined. 
These deaths are tragic because they are largely preventable. As we 
have shown in Rhode Island, when hospital staff follow a checklist of 
basic instructions washing their hands with soap, cleaning a patient's 
skin with antiseptic, placing sterile drapes over the patient, etc.--
rates of infection plummet, and the costs of treating those infections 
disappear. The costs of treating the 100,000 who die, as well as the 
hundreds of thousands who suffer nonlethal infections, disappear.
  Delivery system reform has real promise in improving the management 
and prevention of chronic disease. These diseases accounted for 7 out 
of 10 deaths in the United States in 2011 and at least 75 percent of 
our health care spending.
  I am not alone in saying that a correct diagnosis of the problem will 
lead us to delivery system reform. Gail Wilensky, the former 
Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services under 
President George H.W. Bush, said in 2011, ``If we don't redesign what 
we are doing, we can't just cut unit reimbursement and think we are 
somehow getting a better system.''
  In the private sector, George Halvorson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser 
Permanente said, ``There are people right now who want to cut benefits 
and ration care and have that be the avenue to cost reduction in this 
country and that's wrong. It's so wrong, it's almost criminal. It's an 
inept way of thinking about health care.''
  Saving money by reforming how we deliver health care isn't just 
possible, it is happening. At a 2011 hearing I chaired of the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Greg Poulsen of 
Intermountain Healthcare said:

       Intermountain and other organizations have shown that 
     improving quality is compatible with lowering costs and, 
     indeed, high-quality care is generally less expensive than 
     substandard care.

  So when Republicans say we must cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits to 
fix our deficit, that assertion is flat-out wrong.
  Attacking Medicare and Medicaid is consistent with a particular 
political ideology, but it is not consistent with the facts. It ignores 
the fact that we operate a wildly inefficient health care system and 
that our health care spending problem is systemwide, not unique to 
Federal health programs. It is not just Medicare and Medicaid; former 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said of the Defense budget, ``We're 
being eaten alive by health care.''
  The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that we could 
save approximately $700 billion every year in our health care system 
without compromising health outcomes. The Institute of Medicine 
recently put this number at $750 billion. Other groups are even more 
optimistic: The New England Healthcare Institute has reported that $850 
billion could be saved annually. The Lewin Group and former Bush 
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have estimated annual savings of a 
staggering $1 trillion. Most recently, the Commonwealth Fund laid out a 
set of policies that would accelerate health care delivery system 
reform and slow health spending by $2 trillion over the next 10 years.
  These savings will have a dramatic impact on the Federal budget. The 
Federal Government spends 40 percent of

[[Page S2024]]

America's health care expenditures. If the estimate by the Council of 
Economic Advisers is correct, we could reduce the Federal deficit by up 
to $280 billion per year. If we achieve only one-quarter of the Council 
of Economic Advisers' estimate, the Federal savings would be $70 
billion annually. Over a 10-year budget period, that amounts to $700 
billion in Federal health care savings all without taking away any 
benefits, all while likely improving quality of care.
  In a report I issued last year for the Senate Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, I found that the administration has made 
considerable progress on implementing the 45 delivery system reform 
provisions in the law. But more can and must be done. Specifically, I 
again urge the administration to set a cost-savings target for health 
care delivery system reform. A cost-savings target will focus, guide, 
and spur the administration's efforts in a manner that vague intentions 
to ``bend the health care cost curve'' will not. As the Commonwealth 
Fund concluded, ``The establishment of targets can serve both as a 
metric to guide policy development and as an incentive for all involved 
parties to act to make them effective.''
  In 1961, President Kennedy declared that within 10 years the United 
States would put a man on the Moon and return him safely. The message--
and the mission outlined--was clear. The result was a vast mobilization 
of private and public resources to achieve that purpose.
  This administration has a similar opportunity--particularly now, at 
the height of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We need to 
put the full force of American innovation and ingenuity into achieving 
a serious cost-savings target for our Nation's health care system. But 
it is hard to do that if they won't set one.
  I urge the administration to set a cost-savings target, with a number 
and a date. And then let's get to work to give American families the 
health care system they deserve. Instead of waste and inefficiency, 
poor outcomes and missed opportunities, we would have a health care 
system that is the envy of the world.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Today, we are here to talk about the Affordable 
Care Act, and especially the big week that we have had in this country 
in making sure that millions of Americans will now enjoy access to 
quality, affordable health care.
  Last week, we had a chance to talk about this and had other Members 
from all over the country who represent wonderful districts come 
forward and talk about how the Affordable Care Act has been very 
beneficial to their constituents. Part of the discussion last week and 
in the previous months, really since October, has been about whether 
Americans would accept the Affordable Care Act and how many people 
would enroll and how many States would expand Medicaid.
  The numbers are very clear that, despite all of the advertisements 
and the millions of dollars that has been spent on television promoting 
misinformation about the Affordable Care Act, demonizing this as 
socialism and other bad things, that despite all of that, the American 
people have clearly rejected that narrative, that they believe the 
Affordable Care Act and what it is doing for this country are good 
things and that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, as we are, that 
people should be able to afford health care, that they should not be 
denied because of preexisting conditions, that students should be able 
to stay on their parents' plans after college, and that Medicaid for 
low-income Americans should be made more readily available.
  Let's look at some of those numbers. We know, for example, that 7.1 
million people ended up signing up for the Affordable Care Act in the 
exchanges. Now, that is on top of the 3 million students who can now 
stay on their parents' plans because of this act. That is on top of all 
of the States that expanded Medicaid to make sure that folks who don't 
make a lot of money, the vast majority of these people working hard day 
in and day out, that they are going to be covered, too.
  There are still about 19 States, including my home State of Texas, 
that have chosen not to expand Medicaid. That has been such an 
incredible blow to the people of my State. For example, we have the 
highest percentage of people in the Nation that have no health care 
coverage.
  On Monday, I was back home in San Antonio and there was a large 
enrollment fair, as there was in many cities throughout the country on 
Monday. It was probably about 6, 7, and this fair was going to close at 
8. So I went over to see how it was going and to say hello to folks. 
There was a long line of people waiting. Families were there, two and 
three and four and five family members. People brought their young kids 
to enroll them in insurance.

[[Page H2834]]

  One of the narratives during this debate has been this idea that has 
been pushed that this is just benefiting people who may be lazy or not 
working. One of the things that struck me when I was making my way 
through that line was that there were so many people there that had the 
insignia of the company that they work for or their uniform on. They 
told me that they had just come straight from work and how grateful 
they were that this was going to go on until 8 so that they had time to 
come after work.
  It was really a stark reminder that--despite all of the stories or 
this idea of the makers and the takers in this country, or 47 percent 
of people versus 53 percent--the vast majority of people who are 
benefiting from this law, benefiting from things like Medicaid, are, in 
fact, not just takers, but are hardworking Americans who are powering 
our economy. All they want is a fair chance at the American Dream.
  We talk a lot about freedoms in this body. The United States Congress 
is, of course, one of the main bodies in government that is entrusted 
with protecting American freedoms. So we talk about our First Amendment 
rights, whether it is freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom 
of religion, or Second Amendment rights, other amendments, the right 
against self-incrimination, all of these things, all of the Bill of 
Rights enshrined in the Constitution. But I pose the question to those 
who continue to want to repeal the Affordable Care Act: What good are 
any of those rights that we are entitled to as Americans, that previous 
generations of Americans and this generation of Americans have fought 
so hard to preserve, what good is freedom of expression, freedom of 
religion, freedom of speech if you are stuck in a hospital bed sick, 
broke because you can't pay your hospital bills, worried about your 
family and your future?
  Remember, that is not an uncommon situation for Americans over the 
years.

                              {time}  1545

  The biggest reason for personal bankruptcies before the Affordable 
Care Act was the fact that people were racking up these huge health 
care bills that they couldn't pay, and this happened for a few reasons. 
Sometimes people just couldn't afford the insurance for their primary 
care physicians--the doctors they would go see--or emergency room 
doctors, not doctors in some clinic or private practice. Sometimes, 
even if they could afford insurance, they were hitting lifetime caps--
somebody with cancer, somebody with MS--somebody like my grandmother 
and my mother with diabetes, who suffer from complications. My 
grandmother, before she passed away from congenital heart failure 
because of diabetes, had her leg amputated.
  There are so many people who can't enjoy the freedoms that we are 
supposed to be able to enjoy because they can't afford health care 
coverage, so they have ended up not going to the doctor for many years. 
They have put off going to the doctor for a long time because, if they 
went without insurance to the doctor, then they wouldn't be able to 
make their mortgage payments or to pay their rent or pay their car 
bills, cars that they need in order to get to work. These are the 
common experiences of millions of Americans, not just of low-income 
Americans--certainly, low-income Americans--but also of Americans in 
the middle class, who power our Nation and power our economy.
  I want us to consider the success of the Affordable Care Act. Of 
course, there was the Web site that had a tough rollout, and a lot of 
people doubted whether the program would be successful. This has shown 
also that the Affordable Care Act is about more than just a Web site 
that had a glitch. Again, the fundamental reason that this law has 
passed is that America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, and for 
generations, other countries with a lot less money have been able to 
provide and make available health care to their citizens a lot better 
than the United States of America has.
  Consider this: with the Affordable Care Act, up to 129 million 
Americans who have preexisting health conditions, including up to 17 
million children, no longer have to worry about being denied coverage 
or being charged higher premiums due to their health statuses. Again, 
you might have a woman who is 55 years old or 60 years old. She loses 
her job that gave her insurance, so now she tries to find another job, 
and tries to buy insurance, and she is rejected. She tries to go on to 
the individual market, and finds that she can't afford the prices on 
the individual market.
  What is that person to do? A lot of them are suffering from chronic 
diseases.
  In south Texas, for example, we have an incredibly high rate of 
diabetes. In other parts of the country, in other communities, it is 
other diseases, but whatever it is, these ailments are common, and they 
are forcing people oftentimes into bankruptcy, into not being able to 
pay their bills or in not being able to get health care coverage. So 
lifting the lifetime caps has made a mountain of difference for people. 
It has helped ease their minds, and it has also made things more fair.
  Yesterday, the President was pretty very forceful in his comments. I 
think they did the press conference in the Rose Garden, but I was on an 
airplane, so I couldn't watch the press conference, but I got to see 
some of the clips. He made a comment that really struck me, which is 
that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay. This law is not going 
anywhere despite all of the opponents and despite the millions of 
dollars that have been spent on television for misinformation and 
demonizing this law.
  The reason it is not going anywhere is not just because of the 
political reality. I mean, the politics, really, are tough on both 
sides. The country had been evenly divided for a long time. The reason 
that it is not going anywhere is because of the human reality, because 
we want fewer people going bankrupt because they are hitting lifetime 
caps and their insurance companies won't pay for their bills anymore. 
It is because you want more people who are not using the emergency 
rooms as their only way to get medical care and putting off ailments 
and diseases because, if they go to the doctor, they know that a month 
later or 3 weeks later they are going to run up these huge bills, and 
they know they can't pay them.
  By the way, many folks have pointed this out, but certainly, when we 
had a dialogue last week, I pointed out again that there is a measure 
here also of personal responsibility, of people getting insurance in 
the same way that many States require you to get auto insurance. Why do 
States require you to get auto insurance? It is because, if you rear-
end somebody, somebody has got to fix his car. In many public hospitals 
throughout the Nation, certainly in Texas--in San Antonio, for 
example--what happens routinely, oftentimes not from San Antonio but 
from surrounding counties, is that these folks come in, and you can't 
deny anybody emergency room coverage. You have to treat them. Then you 
send them a bill, and they can't pay the bill. They don't have 
insurance, and they can't pay the bill. Guess who pays the bill? That 
bill has to be paid somehow. The taxpayers end up paying that bill. 
Somebody has to eat that cost, and it is not the hospital. They pay a 
fraction of it, but those costs are spread, and all Americans have to 
pay them State by State, county by county. So this is a way that people 
can not only benefit from the Act but can also take a measure of 
personal responsibility for their own health care coverage.
  That is why in the 1980s and in the 1990s, which was before this 
issue became so political and before President Obama was inaugurated in 
2009, that originally the kind of legislation that we now know as 
ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act, was actually legislation that 
was promoted by the very conservative Heritage Foundation. It was 
considered to be a conservative idea in the same way that somebody 
getting car insurance--taking personal responsibility in case you hit 
somebody on the road--is thought to be a conservative idea. You are 
going to own up to your responsibilities. It has been very interesting 
over the last 4 years and even over the last few months to see the 
evolution of the arguments about health care coverage and about the 
Affordable Care Act and about how politics sometimes and often has 
trumped public policy.
  In a minute, I would like to yield to my good friend from California, 
Mark Takano, but before I do that, I want to share with you just a few 
stories of

[[Page H2835]]

people from my area, from Texas, who said that I could share their 
stories with them and how grateful they are that they are now able to 
afford health care.
  The first one is a woman named Magdalena. She is a substitute teacher 
and had a hard time transitioning to San Antonio since moving from Del 
Rio. Del Rio is a city right along the Texas-Mexico border. It is about 
2\1/2\ hours from San Antonio. She has dedicated herself to taking care 
of her family, and she often puts her family in front of herself. Like 
many mothers, she was worried about her health as she moved into her 
senior years. She was skeptical about trying to fill out an 
application, but she eventually came to an Enroll SA event. Many cities 
had Enroll SA or Enroll Austin or Enroll Dallas. After sitting down 
with a counselor, she was able to get a plan for 5 cents a month. This 
is a woman who had previously been unable to get health care coverage. 
She returned to the registration table and wept tears of joy, with her 
eyes filled with hope, and the volunteers wept along with her. Her face 
just lit up because now her life was truly changing.

  Like many others, Magdalena is a hardworking American, somebody who 
has taken care of her family, who is going to work day in and day out, 
who is not asking for very much--just a chance to enjoy the freedoms 
that we talk about here in Congress a lot.
  With that, I would like to yield to my colleague from California, 
Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez.
  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Thank you so much to the gentleman 
from Texas, San Antonio, and New Braunfels.
  Mr. Speaker, today, we are talking about the Affordable Care Act. 
This is so, so important as we have seen this week 7 million-plus 
American enrollees, and I know there are still some who tried to get in 
at the very end and are in the pipeline. I am hoping we push even 
closer to 8 million new enrollees into the Affordable Care Act.
  It is interesting because we over here on the Democratic side have 
really been working to enroll people--we have been working to talk to 
people about how important it is to have a health care plan--while at 
the same time we have seen from the other side 50-plus votes to try to 
undercut, to undermine, to eliminate the ACA, but here we are. They 
were repealing. We were enrolling.
  California's enrollment numbers surpassed 1.2 million people this 
past Monday, which is more than double of any other State. On top of 
that, the expansion of Medi-Cal, which is our Medicaid piece of this, 
has covered another 1.5 million low-income families, so we are pretty 
excited. California looked at this and said, this Medi-Cal plan--this 
plan of having a health care plan for lower income families, for the 
members in these lower income families--is so important. For the first 
3 years, it is paid 100 percent from the Federal Government.
  So, if you are sitting in a State like California and if you have 1.5 
million new families who didn't have health care before that was paid 
for, they were putting up with being sick, doing what we call in 
Spanish ``aguantamos.'' If you got sick, you wouldn't go to the doctor. 
You wouldn't go and you wouldn't go, and you would work through. You 
would go to work, and you would be sick. You wouldn't go until, 
finally, you couldn't take it anymore. You were really, really sick. 
Then where would you go? You would go to the emergency room, which is 
the highest cost place in the entire health care system. Instead of 
putting up with not having health care--instead of aguantamos--we now 
have 1.5 million families who are in Medi-Cal and, again, as of Monday, 
1.2 million people who are in what we call our exchange, Covered 
California.
  This is very, very important, but there is also another piece of this 
that is incredibly important, which is that now we have to work with 
people. Now that we have enrolled them for the year, we need to work 
with people who have never before had a health care plan. They don't 
know what a primary doctor is. They don't even know what a specialist 
is. They don't know what the process is to go. They don't know about 
getting a baseline. Go and get an annual physical for free under these 
plans. This is for free. We have to teach them.
  So you go in. You get a relationship with a doctor. You get a 
physical. You get a baseline. You get your blood drawn. For someone 
like me, that is incredibly important because, for example, diabetes 
runs in my family. My granddad died of it, my grandma, my aunt, her 
five kids. It is 3\1/2\ times more likely to be in Latinos than in the 
average Anglo in America. It is being able to go and get blood work 
done so that can you see where you are, whether you have the propensity 
to get diabetes, for example, because diabetes in over 50 percent of 
the cases can be stopped; it can be turned back. It is about having 
some nutritional understanding, being able to eat the right way, 
sequencing your food, exercising after you eat--just a 15-minute walk. 
There were just two studies that were released this past May that said, 
if you have a propensity for diabetes but if you walk 15 minutes after 
you eat, you can cut that propensity by almost 50 percent.
  This is information that our communities do not have. Low-income, 
immigrant communities in particular are less likely to have this kind 
of information. Now, if they have health care plans and if we teach 
them how to go and get that baseline--get their annual physicals, get 
their pap smears, get their mammograms--and if there is something 
wrong, let's work on fixing it, and it takes personal responsibility to 
do that.

                              {time}  1600

  I have to get up early in the morning and go and run. I have to go to 
the gym to ensure that, since the propensity is high for me, I don't 
get that because it takes some personal responsibility--personal 
responsibility not to eat pizza all the time, and things of that sort, 
yes, personal responsibility.
  It takes a health care plan, it takes knowledge, it takes access. 
These places have to be close by. We have to have clinics and doctors 
signed up into these plans so we can go to them. It takes cultural 
knowledge, as you know, being from San Antonio. Some of it is a 
language barrier. Some of it is just understanding how our community 
works and how we spread it by word of mouth, rather than go to 
computers to find our information.
  Knowing all of this will help us ensure that, now that people are 
enrolled, they begin to use the plans effectively, and when they use 
them effectively, we drive down that cost curve that was happening. In 
California, on average, it was a 17 percent increase in medical health 
care costs on an annual basis. That was not sustainable.
  The only people who could have liked the old system were the wealthy 
or the healthy. If you got sick, you had the money, or you never got 
sick; but today, we can fix these things.
  Today, we can fix these things by moving forward with these health 
care plans and with teaching people how to use them efficiently and 
effectively, so that all of society becomes stronger and healthier, and 
that is why we voted to put this in. That is why we have worked so 
hard.
  I am so thrilled that the gentleman from Texas wanted to discuss this 
issue today.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congresswoman. Thank you for your 
passion over the many years on health care and many other issues, and 
you raised several wonderful points, but there are a few in particular 
that I wanted to mention.
  We debate our national debt and deficit here a lot. Since the 
Affordable Care Act was passed, as we know, health care has been the 
biggest driver of our debt. The Affordable Care Act has actually slowed 
the cost of health care, the slowest growth that we have seen in 
decades.
  So this is something that has actually been good and will be good for 
our fiscal health in this country. Thank you for alluding to that.
  Also, you mentioned that in many of the communities we represent--not 
only in California or in Texas, but many places--ailments like diabetes 
are things that affect so many people in our neighborhoods and our 
cities, but it is not just diabetes.
  In other places, it could be cancer or sickle cell anemia or multiple 
sclerosis. All of those patients will now find a lot more relief 
because the United States Congress passed this bill.

  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I couldn't agree with you more. 
There are pockets of this.
  I just want to leave with one story. A few years ago, we had this one 
company who was a lensmaker kind of company. It was somebody who had 
retail stores, and you would go in and get your eyes checked. They 
would grind lenses and get glasses for you. Usually, they could do it 
in one stop, in 2 or 3 hours, et cetera.
  They said: Let's do this in your area, Loretta; let's hold a health 
care fair.
  We had a lot of different types of people offering services, and they 
said: For the first 400 people who show up, we will have 
ophthalmologists there--medical eye doctors--and we will take a look 
and see what is going on with people. If we need to grind lenses, we'll 
grind lenses for them and give them free glasses.
  Because even if you had a health care plan, most people didn't have 
vision or dental, so people were not buying glasses. They couldn't 
afford it.
  I got there at 7:30 in the morning to this health care fair. It 
started at 8. There were 600 people in line already, so we gave coupons 
for these people to be able to walk into one of those retail stores and 
get the service for free. We kept the first 400.
  One of the young ladies that worked with me stayed all day with one 
of the doctors, making sure the patients were coming in and out, giving 
him the things he needed, et cetera. At the end of the day, the doctor 
turned to her and said: Do you know that 80 percent of the people that 
we saw today had diabetes or were about to get diabetes?
  They didn't even know it because one of the first symptoms for 
diabetes is blurry vision, so these people were thinking they are 
getting old and their vision is kind of going, but the reality was they 
were sick.
  They didn't know it because they did not have health coverage, and, 
like I said, that is a disease that you can really get rid of or 
eliminate in your life if you work at it.
  These people need that knowledge. These people need that ability to 
walk into the doctor and to get their blood tested and to see what is 
going on, so that we can tell them: if you don't change what is going 
on in your life, you are going to be diabetic.
  By the way, the plans before, if you had diabetes and you had to have 
your leg chopped off, for example, we would pay for that. You see what 
I am saying?
  We wouldn't be paying to let them know you may be getting diabetes or 
you have diabetes; we would pay after the fact to chop off their legs. 
Or, if they went blind, we would have them at home because, now, they 
couldn't work.
  So it is going to make Americans healthier. When Americans are 
healthier, they will be more productive. They will have less sick days. 
It will be good for industry.
  So I am really thrilled to have voted for the ACA. I am really 
thrilled, 4 years-plus now, and that we are seeing it now, at the 
ground level, with people signed up for plans; and now, we have just 
got to make sure they go and use these, so that we can get them 
healthy.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congresswoman Sanchez.
  Now, I would like to yield to my friend from Houston, Texas, 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the convener of this Special Order and 
the colleagues I have heard since I have come to the floor, like 
Congresswoman Sanchez.
  Congressman Castro, thank you very much. Coming from similar 
territory--the State of Texas--I just hope that you will allow me, just 
for a moment, to juxtapose the present pending bill on the floor.
  I heard you speak of the bill, H.R. 2575, as well, and with all due 
respect to the proponent of the bill, it is confusing. It is confusing 
in the backdrop of the number that you have standing alongside of you, 
7 million Americans and growing.
  Because there were many Americans who were in the queue--in the line, 
when March 31 came, and because of President Obama, they will now have 
extended the opportunity to finish the work, and I was with a lot of 
navigators and people enrolling over the weekend. They were excited 
about being able to finish the task.
  In Texas alone, that was the epicenter of unemployed. I keep saying, 
``unemployed.'' Certainly, it has unemployed persons as well. There are 
164,000 without unemployment insurance, which really is what baffles me 
about this effort at repeal and this effort of determining that, with 
30 hours of hard work, you can't get health insurance.

  In the State of Texas, 5.198 million individuals on private insurance 
have gained coverage for at least one preventative health care service, 
such as mammograms, birth control, and immunizations. That is for 
people with private insurance.
  Also, 10.695 million individuals with preexisting conditions like 
asthma, cancer, or diabetes, including 1.6 children, will no longer 
have to be worried about being denied coverage in our own State alone.
  As well, 5.189 million Texans have gained expanded mental health and 
substance abuse or use disorder benefits, and 4 million-plus uninsured 
Texans will have new health insurance options through the idea of going 
into the marketplace.
  Also, 233,000 seniors and people with disabilities have saved $866 in 
prescription medications, and 357,000 young adults have gained health 
insurance, and 7 million Texans will no longer have to worry about 
annual limits. That is, of course, those who are uninsured and who can 
access the new Affordable Care Act insurance.
  The other point is that, over these last 2 days, we have seen the 
reality of Americans clamoring for health insurance, with 4 million 
people accessing the healthcare.gov Web site.
  And let me make this as breaking news--because this is what we were 
hearing from those opposing it--80 to 85 percent of those who have 
enrolled have paid their first premium. This is not a story of I have 
enrolled and you never hear from me again; this is a story of serious 
decisions being made by serious persons.
  Let me offer, as well, some of the tragedies over the years--and I am 
very pleased to have cast that vote for the Affordable Care Act. I have 
been to any number of townhall meetings to share it with my 
constituents, some of whom who did not understand or agree.
  In the course of the hearings, I have heard of so many stories that 
we don't repeat anymore, like the little girl that had leukemia. Her 
parents took her over and over again to the insurance company to get 
the opportunity for her to be covered. She had a preexisting disease. 
She had no coverage. She ultimately lost her life.
  I believe--I don't want to call up facts that are not accurate--they 
even took her to the insurance company's office to plead for her to be 
covered. It was at that point near the end of her life, which she 
shortly thereafter lost.
  We have the mother who came to us and said yes, her son had a 
difficult history. He was a trained lawyer. He was doing pro bono work. 
He was in Atlanta, Georgia. Frankly, he had gotten hepatitis. Because 
he had no health care, the only coverage he could get was from going 
into an emergency room. He had waited too long.
  He was going into the emergency room, being the only source of health 
care. If he had had the ability to go to a doctor, in spite of his 
history of drug abuse at that time--a trained lawyer--he would have 
been able to maintain his life.
  My last one is the issue of a young resident who took a summer 
position in Atlanta, Georgia, but his health care was in a 25-mile 
perimeter around Washington, D.C.
  He fell ill with kidney disease during that summer. His father was a 
doctor. He was a student. He didn't have the ability to stay on his 
parents' insurance. His insurance was a school-based insurance that 
said it could only be around the school.
  Congressman, his father had to drive hours to pick him up and put him 
in his car and pray for his survival and get him back into the 
perimeter of his health insurance.
  This is what we lived with before the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and 
before the President ultimately signed it, and so I am baffled as to 
why, for the 52nd time, there is an attempt to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act with H.R. 2575.
  Let me just say that the importance of this Special Order is to 
emphasize whose side Members are on. I am on

[[Page H2837]]

the side of those who are clamoring for good health care and who have 
children who need good health care. I am on the side of those who need 
the expanded Medicaid and ask the State of Texas to do it.
  As I close, just on this bill, H.R. 2575, I am still trying to 
understand what it means to tell someone who works full time, 30 hours 
a week, in a company that has 50 employees, that you cannot get health 
care.
  So to the employers out there, frankly, I believe that some people 
are speaking for you that may not be really speaking for you. Because 
when you pay your employees and they get health care, they have more 
cash to buy your goods.
  More people have income to come back to the grocery store, come back 
to the restaurant, come to the small clothing store, or to buy flowers.
  Why would you deny employees health care so that they can get sick, 
go to the emergency room, and have days off? It doesn't make sense.
  I think this bill is way before its time. There is no evidence that 
we need to reduce the hours of working Americans. There is evidence 
that we should pass unemployment insurance for those who are 
chronically unemployed. We need to do that.
  There is evidence to raise the minimum wage, but there is no evidence 
that this is a problem of catastrophic moment that we are debating it 
for 4 hours on the floor.
  So I want to congratulate the gentleman for his leadership on this 
question.

                              {time}  1615

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Thank you, Congresswoman Jackson Lee. Thank you 
for all of your work on this and many other issues. You are one of the 
most tireless folks, Republican or Democrat, who is involved in all the 
floor debates and amendments and proposing legislation. So thank you.
  Just a few things that you mentioned. You were talking about the bill 
that we just discussed, and it was essentially saying that for sizeable 
businesses, not small businesses, because the small businesses are 
exempted from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. That is 
worth repeating again. Small businesses are exempted from the 
requirements of the Affordable Care Act, so this was about larger 
businesses.
  Instead of requiring that they offer health care coverage to their 
employees at 30 hours, the Republicans wanted to move it up to 40. One 
of the myths has been that all of these employers are reducing hours 
and cutting employees hours and this is hurting the workers. Well, the 
Congressional Budget Office, which both sides use as a neutral resource 
to figure out what's what, said that there is no evidence of that. 
There is no trend that says that part-time work versus full-time work 
is increasing because of the Affordable Care Act.
  I also pointed out earlier in the discussion that part of the 
challenge in this economy is that American business has bounced back, 
but ordinary Americans still have not fully bounced back.
  So, when we see that the stock market every other week, if not every 
other day, is hitting alltime highs and at the.."

             OPPOSING THE REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Brown) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the poor will always be with us, 
but our job is to help raise the standards. I've got to tell you, if it 
were not already invented, I would say this Congress invented the words 
the ``do nothing Congress''--do nothing.
  Today is the second day that we are debating the repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act. Let me be clear that not one single person who has 
come to this floor debating doing away with it doesn't have insurance, 
because we have the best insurance. In fact, my blood pressure is up, 
so I went downstairs. Because I have insurance, I was able to test my 
blood pressure and get some additional medication. In fact, later I was 
able to go to the dentist because I have insurance. Yet what we are 
debating is you at home not having health care, because we--everybody 
in this House, every Member who has come to this floor--has health 
care.

                              {time}  1110

  Every single President, since Theodore Franklin Roosevelt, for 75 
years has tried to push some form of universal health care, and I want 
to thank President Barack Obama. They like to say ``ObamaCare.'' I want 
to say, ``President Barack Obama cares, and he was able to accomplish 
something.'' Let's be clear that the President proposes, and the 
Congress disposes. So it had to be the Congress. It was the Democratic 
Congress, the Democratic Senate, and the President that passed the 
bill.
  Instead of discussing health care repeal, we should be debating VA 
construction. In my State as of July 1, the VA paid an additional 
$500,000 to rent a portable operating room for a project that is 95 
percent complete, but we haven't had a chance on the floor to take up 
VA construction. We have 31 times that we're taking up repealing health 
care. I visited that facility last month, and I found out that it would 
have been a health risk not to expand the program for the veterans in 
that area.
  People often say, ``What did the Democratic House, President, and 
Congress do?'' We passed the largest VA budget in the history of the 
United States of America. We took care of the veterans. We had a far-
reaching budget. We gave care to the caregivers of our veterans. It 
goes on and on.
  I really do believe to whom God has given much, much is expected. He 
expects us to work to empower the American people with jobs and health 
care. Basically ``do nothing'' is the label of this Congress, the Do-
Nothing Congress.

               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment 
briefly on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was 
disclosed late yesterday by our distinguished majority leader, Senator 
Reid, to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude for the extraordinary work 
in putting together this very complex legislative proposal. Also, 
compliments are due to Senator Baucus, who chairs the Finance 
Committee, and Senator Dodd, who carried on the work of Senator Kennedy 
on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions bill. The bill provides 
for gross spending of $979 billion over a 10-year period, under the $1 
trillion dollar mark. The coverage allocation is $848 billion. There 
are gross savings of $1,109 billion, and the deficit impact is to have 
a reduction of some $130 billion over the 10-year period. In the second 
10-year period, the projection for savings is substantially greater. 
There will be millions of Americans covered who do not now have health 
coverage, so over 94 percent of all legal residents of all ages will be 
covered.
  We are now digesting this very complex piece of legislation. The 
majority leader has scheduled a cloture vote for Saturday at 8 p.m. It 
is my hope and, candidly, my expectation that we will have the 60 votes 
to proceed for the consideration of this bill.
  It is my view that inaction is not an option; that there are too many 
people not covered by health insurance or who are underinsured. The 
cost of health coverage is escalating at such a tremendous rate. It is 
having a great impact especially on small businesses. A recent 
prominent publication noted that rates for small business were being 
dramatically increased. Senator Harkin scheduled a hearing in the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. One of my 
constituents from Lancaster came in to testify that his premiums were 
rising by 128 percent. So I believe that inaction is not an option.
  We have had many declarations of positions, and in the Senate, where 
you need 60 votes to move ahead, every one of those votes is 
indispensable. Only one Republican, Senator Snowe in the Finance 
Committee, supported the Finance Committee bill, so there was no

[[Page S11583]]

margin for error. It would be my hope that my colleagues will not draw 
any lines in the sand, realizing that no legislative proposal is going 
to meet the expectations and the desires of every individual Senator. 
There are 100 of us. There are 435 Members of the House of 
Representatives. If there is an art to politics, it is an art of 
listening, of being flexible, and accommodation or compromise.
  So we are undertaking a major historic event. Efforts have been made 
since the days of Theodore Roosevelt to have this kind of health 
coverage legislation. It is too important for us to fail.
  (The remarks of Senator Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 
2805 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced 
Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')

 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 45, REPEAL OF PATIENT PROTECTION 
                        AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 215 and ask for its immediate consideration.
  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:

                              H. Res. 215

       Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it 
     shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 45) 
     to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and 
     health care-related provisions in the Health Care and 
     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. All points of order 
     against consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment 
     printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying 
     this resolution shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as 
     amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order 
     against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The 
     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, 
     as amended, and on any amendment thereto to final passage 
     without intervening motion except: (1) two hours of debate 
     equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs 
     and ranking minority members of the Committees on Education 
     and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means; 
     and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 
hour.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentlelady from New York (Ms. Slaughter), 
pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only.


                             General Leave

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BURGESS. House Resolution 215 provides for a rule to consider the 
full repeal of the flawed, ill-conceived and inappropriately named 
Affordable Care Act, a bill whose final language was written by staff 
on the Senate Finance Committee and the actual legislative text of 
which received not a single committee hearing or markup in this body. 
While many hearings and markups were held on other iterations of other 
health care bills, the legislation that was signed by the President 
received not a single moment of scrutiny in this House and contained 
none of the bipartisan amendments that were accepted during the markups 
of other health care bills, including H.R. 3200, which passed the House 
but was never considered by the Senate. As such, only a full repeal is 
acceptable, and that is what this rule provides for.
  The rule provides for 2 hours of debate, controlled by the Committees 
on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and the 
Workforce. Further, the rule self-executes the Bachmann amendment, 
which provides for a clean repeal of the entire ACA, consistent with 
the provisions of the opening day rules package of this Congress. The 
rule further provides the minority one motion to recommit with or 
without instructions.
  This approach, a full repeal, will give the House, particularly 
Members who were not here in the past two Congresses, an opportunity to 
have an up-or-down vote, an affirmation or a denial, of the Affordable 
Care Act.
  Americans should have the freedom to make their own health care 
decisions. In March of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act was signed into law. It was drafted quickly and behind closed doors 
at the end of 2009--behind closed doors in the other body, in fact. It 
included secret deals, loopholes, drafting errors, and allowed entirely 
new Federal agencies to be created without congressional knowledge or 
oversight.
  The bottom line: it was not the way to achieve meaningful reform. In 
addition, the Supreme Court ruled last June that the law is, in fact, a 
tax. This is after President Obama continually told the American people 
that it was not a tax.
  The health care system in America needs reform, and it needs 
improvement; but the law that was passed will cost American taxpayers 
and patients millions of dollars. It will not improve care, and it will 
not make care more affordable. We need to start fresh and address the 
issues with commonsense improvements that will focus on the real issues 
at hand--creating a health care system that is focused on patients 
instead of payment, quality instead of quantity, affordability instead 
of cheapness, and innovation instead of stagnation. The first step is 
eliminating bad legislation that simply does not work and that today 
stands in the way of any real improvement. That is why, today, I 
strongly support the repeal of the President's health care law.

[[Page H2671]]

  The President did repeatedly tell us that the penalty associated with 
the individual mandate was not a tax. It was repeated several times in 
the run-up to this bill's being signed. In June, the Supreme Court 
affirmed that the only way that this bill could remain law was that it 
was, indeed, a tax, and Congress has the infinite power to tax. In 
fact, Congress can tax morning, noon, and night. It can tax the 
American people back to the stone age if that's what it wishes, and 
that's what the Affordable Care Act does. When millions are unemployed, 
this is, indeed, the last thing we need.
  It's not just the tax. It's the effect on premiums. Up on the Energy 
and Commerce Web site this week is a study showing how the Affordable 
Care Act is going to affect premiums in the individual market, in the 
small-group market, and in the large-group market; and almost uniformly 
those premiums are going up, and in some cases they are going up a 
staggering amount.
  Last summer, the Supreme Court's decision leaves in place a costly 
and unworkable health care scheme that is hurting America's families, 
that is hurting America's workers, that is hurting America's job 
creators, and that is damaging America's patients. We will all have to 
live with that ruling. If we do not repeal, then we will have to live 
with the law as written. The time has come to step up and do the right 
thing. I urge support of the rule.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, before I discuss the value of the Affordable Care Act, 
commonly referred to as ObamaCare, I must acknowledge the sad fact that 
this will be the 37th time in 29 months that the majority has voted to 
repeal or defund the law, and they know it will not happen. Recent 
estimates are that each vote to repeal or to defund the Affordable Care 
Act has cost $1.45 million in taxpayer money. So today's debate will 
bring the total cost of repeal votes to--wake up there--$53 million and 
counting.
  Now, while the majority wastes our tax dollars, think what we could 
do with $53 million. The agriculture bill we were all talking about 
this morning is ready to take $20 billion out of food stamps, feeding 
poor people, while we waste that kind of money here doing a bill month 
after month after month that we know is not going anywhere. Yet we 
don't have any positive agenda to put forward here. For the last 2 or 3 
months, all we've done are one-House bills that everybody knows are not 
going to get passed, and it really is a tragedy because a CBS study 
says it costs $25 million a week just to run the Congress--and how 
deplorable that kind of waste is with all the problems we have in the 
country.
  We are told that the freshman Republicans would like, once again, to 
have an opportunity to vote to kill health care. I wonder if the 
freshman Republicans, as I know the freshman Democrats do, wouldn't 
like to vote to repeal the sequester or to maybe do a jobs bill, which 
we haven't had in 2\1/2\ years. We are not going to do anything about 
the budget either when we've heard all the time, Why doesn't the Senate 
do a budget? The Senate has done a budget. The Senate has asked over 
and over again for the House to appoint conferees so that we can get 
the budget put together and pass it into law. No action there either. 
Then, because of the sequester cuts, at least 70,000 children have been 
denied access to early education, and thousands of cancer patients have 
been denied their regular cancer treatments.
  The majority says it is holding today's vote, as I said, so that the 
freshmen can repeal the Affordable Care Act. I wish to goodness that 
they would give them something that would really pass and something 
good to vote on.
  Instead of voting to repeal the sequester, the majority is voting for 
the 37th time to repeal a law--and this is very important--that has 
already done so much already. It has given 100 million Americans access 
to free preventative health care, procedures such as mammograms and 
colonoscopies. That's 100 million already. They are voting for the 37th 
time to repeal a law that saves seniors $6.1 billion in prescription 
drug costs already. They are voting for the 37th time to repeal a law 
that has provided 3.1 million young adults with health insurance 
already that they otherwise could not afford.
  The Affordable Care Act has been particularly beneficial for 
America's women. Did you know that prior to the passage of this law in 
eight States and in the District of Columbia, domestic violence was 
classified as a preexisting condition and you could be denied 
insurance? They were denied insurance because they had been abused and 
because, perhaps, they would be again.

                              {time}  1300

  Did you know that thanks to a practice called ``gender rating,'' 
women were charged as much as 46 percent more in premiums for the same 
level of insurance as a man? Maybe you didn't know that. But lots of 
women in the country are getting rebates for that very reason.
  Because of the Affordable Care Act, both of these discriminatory 
practices have been outlawed. In addition, the Affordable Care Act has 
already returned money to the pockets of millions of women thanks to 
the rebates required by insurance companies under the health care law.
  Finally, the Affordable Care Act outlawed lifetime and yearly limits, 
insidious insurance practices that capped the amount of health care an 
insurance company would provide. But because of health care reform, 
Americans no longer have to worry that they will be denied health care 
that they need simply because insurance companies refuse to pay for 
their continued care.
  And did you know that 85 percent of your premium dollar will go to 
health care and not to other things that the insurance company wants to 
spend it on?
  The majority has claimed that the Affordable Care Act is bad for 
America's small businesses. The truth is that for any small business 
that has less than 50 employees, it requires them to do nothing 
different, nothing at all from what they're doing today. But small 
businesses with less than 25 employees are eligible for a tax credit of 
35 percent right now. And on January 1, that tax credit will increase 
to 50 percent. You will get a tax credit on half of the health 
insurance you pay when you have under 25 employees.
  The majority has also claimed and will continue to claim that the 
Affordable Care Act was passed in the dark of night through a closed-
door process that denied their side of the aisle the opportunity to 
participate in the legislative process. This charge is categorically 
untrue. The Affordable Care Act was the product of nearly 100 hearings 
and 83 hours of committee markups, including both Republicans and 
Democrats making amendments. The House heard from 181 witnesses, both 
Democrat and Republican. There were 239 amendments considered in House 
committees and 121 that were adopted.
  And while some on the other side of the aisle charge that the final 
version of the law was rushed through the House, the final bill was 
available for 72 hours before any Members were asked to vote on it.
  In contrast, the Patients' Rights Repeal Act, which we're doing again 
today as I said for the 37th time, is being considered after no 
committee hearings, no committee markups, and under a closed rule. That 
means there will be no amendments on this bill. Even if one were 
sympathetic toward the majority's goal, the complete abuse of the 
legislative process should give every Member of this Chamber pause.
  Mr. Speaker, today's vote is just the latest in the majority's all-
out effort to undermine the process of implementing the health care 
law. Their efforts have taken many forms, but central to it all is 
their refusal to provide the necessary funding to fully implement the 
law and a gleeful willingness to criticize an implementation process 
that is underfunded and undermined at every single turn.
  Despite their best efforts, I believe that in the years to come, the 
majority will find that they stood on the wrong side of history, just 
as they stood on the wrong side of history when Social Security was 
passed and when Medicare came into being.
  Indeed, the opponents of the Affordable Care Act have already had 
their day in court. Last summer, the Supreme Court affirmed the 
constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, putting to rest any false 
legal concerns that opponents had.

[[Page H2672]]

  With the constitutionality of the law no longer in question, one 
might expect opponents to criticize the law's impact on our Nation's 
finances. But here again, the facts will stand in the way. Over the 
last 3 years, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent. That, Mr. 
Speaker, is the lowest growth rate in 50 years. And according to the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, repealing the Affordable Care 
Act would actually increase our Nation's deficit by more than $100 
billion over the next 10 years. Please think of that and understand 
what they are trying to do away with today--the things that help you.
  Mr. Speaker, providing safe, secure, and affordable health care for 
our citizens has been the goal of both Republican and Democrat 
lawmakers for generations. As far back as Theodore Roosevelt, we have 
acknowledged the need to provide our citizens with a health care system 
that puts their health before industry profits, that has as good 
outcomes as other parts of the world provide for their citizens. We 
need to treat health care as a right for all, not a privilege for the 
lucky few.
  Under the leadership of a Democratic Congress, we managed to realize 
at long last this long-awaited goal by passing the Affordable Care Act 
through an open, deliberative, and thorough legislative process. And 
from reducing our Nation's health care spending to expanding health 
care to millions of Americans who could not afford it, the Affordable 
Care Act is succeeding.

  It is in this light that the majority's 37th vote in 29 months to 
repeal health care should be judged. And it's hard to judge their 
politically driven vote as anything other than a disservice to the 
American people, a waste of taxpayer money and a way to spread 
misinformation.
  I urge my colleagues to reject today's rule and the underlying 
legislation. And I reaffirm my pride in supporting the law that is 
already helping to save lives and already providing American people 
with secure and affordable health care. And after it is fully 
implemented next year, all Americans will benefit.
  I reserve the balance of my time
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, now I would like to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas, a member of the Budget Committee, Roger Williams.
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of freedom and free 
enterprise, the hallmarks of our great American democracy. A government 
that places high value on these principles does not force its citizens 
to hand over their hard-earned money for a mandatory product, in this 
case health insurance. This is not how it's done in America.
  Mr. Speaker, Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues rushed this 
bill through Congress more than 3 years ago. Democrats and Republicans 
can agree on one thing, that this is very flawed and is not even what 
Americans asked for in the first place. Even President Obama has signed 
into law seven bills that dismantle provisions of his health care law.
  Defying common sense, the President and Democrats and Congress 
continue pushing forward with implementation of this disastrous law. 
And who wants it? Members of Obama's own party are now doubting how the 
law will work. Some of the key players who wrote the bill don't even 
want it. Senator Max Baucus said the health care law is a train wreck, 
and Senator Jay Rockefeller said that it's overly complicated and 
beyond comprehension.
  Architects of this law don't want it, insurance companies don't want 
it, the majority of the public doesn't want it, organized labor doesn't 
want it, and as a small business owner of nearly 42 years, I can tell 
you that small businesses don't want it.
  No business owner would run their business like the President is 
running this government and this massive health care overhaul. I can 
say from firsthand experience that small businesses--the backbone of 
our economy--are literally hurting.
  As a job creator, I know how businesses can no longer hire. They 
can't take risks that would grow the economy. I've heard from people 
all over my district who have work available and positions ready to 
fill, but they can't hire anyone or else they risk going over the 
number of 50 employees and being subject to the ObamaCare employee 
mandate. Everybody wants to be at 49.
  How is this good for Americans and America?
  The struggling economy has already forced families to cut back and 
tighten their budgets. How does the President expect these hardworking 
taxpayers to pay an additional $3,000 each year for ObamaCare?
  I've had employees come to me in tears wondering how they're going to 
provide coverage for their families. And even the few Americans able to 
keep their current insurance will see their premiums rise by an average 
of 73 percent.
  Again, I ask, how is that good for America?
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to quote Patrick Henry. He 
claimed:

       The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to 
     restrain the people. It is an instrument for the people to 
     restrain the government--lest it come to dominate our lives 
     and interest.

  Let's put an end to the chaos and do what's right for our families, 
our businesses, and our tax dollars. Repeal ObamaCare today--the 
quicker the better.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Matsui).
  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the rule and the 
underlying legislation.
  Well, here we go again. In fact, I've lost count of how many times 
we've had to vote on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The underlying legislation before us today would deny my constituents 
and the American people access to affordable health care. It would 
increase health costs and reduce benefits for millions of American 
families.
  It's particularly ironic that during Older Americans Month, we are 
here voting on a bill that will eliminate benefits to seniors, 
including preventive services and savings on prescription drugs.
  It would allow insurance companies to deny coverage to Americans with 
preexisting conditions, drop coverage when people get sick, reinstitute 
lifetime limits on coverage and charge people more based merely on 
gender.

                              {time}  1310

  The Affordable Care Act has already created long-lasting benefits for 
many of my constituents, including Theresa, a single mother of four 
whose youngest child is 20 and lives with a preexisting condition. 
Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Theresa was personally spending over 
$10,000 a year to pay for her care. Her daughter's medical condition 
prevented her from attending college. But thanks to the Affordable Care 
Act, she was able to be added back on to her mother's health plan. This 
has meant tremendous savings for Theresa, who was worried she might 
lose her home, along with the care her daughter desperately needed.
  A vote against this rule and against the underlying legislation is a 
vote to protect our constituents from unfair insurance company 
practices, to provide relief to Americans, young and old alike, to 
protect job growth and creation, and for a fiscally responsible future. 
It is time for this Congress to move forward, not backwards.
  I urge my colleagues to vote down this rule and the underlying 
legislation.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding.
  I rise in strong support of this rule. And as a proud cosponsor of 
this bill to repeal ObamaCare, I think it is very important that we in 
this House have this vote. Yes, we've had this vote many times. I think 
it's important to have it again this Congress because so much more has 
come to light since the last time that this vote was held in the last 
Congress. What are some of those things? Well, of course, when Nancy 
Pelosi was Speaker, she famously said, ``You have to pass the bill to 
find out what's in it.''
  Well, we're seeing more and more every day just how many devastating 
things are happening in our economy because of ObamaCare. In fact, how 
bad is it? It's so bad that one of the Senate architects of the bill, 
Senator Max

[[Page H2673]]

Baucus, said: ``I see a huge train wreck coming down.''
  Now, when they were in the back room writing this bill, he was the 
guy with the pen. He wrote the bill in the Senate, and he said it's a 
train wreck coming down.
  Why would we want to do this to the American people? The system of 
health care that we have today has some problems, but why would you 
want to destroy the things that work? You fix the things that work.
  This bill, ObamaCare, is actually scheduled to increase health care 
costs dramatically for American families. In fact, what will it do to 
our health care system? And this is what families are finding out, all 
across not just southeast Louisiana, the area that I represent, but all 
across the country. This chart shows all of the different Federal 
agencies that come in between a patient and their doctor in health 
care. It used to be the patient talking to the doctor, and they made 
the health care decision. That was the sacred relationship in health 
care. Now you've got all of these Federal agencies.
  And who's at the top? The IRS. The IRS is the enforcement arm of 
ObamaCare. And, of course, just in the last few days we've seen the 
corruption at the IRS where they've literally gone and picked winners 
and losers, picked partisan fights, and literally tried to enforce the 
Obama administration's will, punishing the enemies of the Obama 
administration. This is not the agency that should be running health 
care.
  We need to repeal this law and fix the real problems in health care.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Maloney).
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlelady for 
yielding, and for her extraordinary leadership. I rise today, Mr. 
Speaker, in opposition to the Patients' Rights Repeal Act and in 
opposition to the rule.

  Mr. Speaker, at a time when the American people would like Congress 
to focus their attention on increasing and growing the economy and job 
growth, we are instead, for the 37th time, involved in partisan 
politics.
  It is especially troubling that our Republican colleagues have chosen 
to celebrate National Women's Health Week by attempting to undo the 
important gains that were made for women's health in the Affordable 
Care Act. A study issued by the Joint Economic Committee while I was 
chair found that across this country, under the old status quo, an 
estimated 64 million women lacked adequate health insurance, and 39 
percent of all low-income women had no health insurance coverage at 
all.
  A repeal now of the Affordable Care Act could mean that millions of 
American women could find it nearly impossible to gain insurance if 
they had a preexisting condition, such as pregnancy. A repeal now would 
take away benefits women are already receiving such as free mammograms. 
A repeal now would mean the end of lower-cost prescription drugs for 
our seniors. A repeal now would yank young people between the age of 23 
and 26 off their parents' policies. A repeal now would send us back to 
the bad old days, to the days of preexisting conditions, gender 
ratings, and lifetime caps. It would mean that in this next year alone, 
over 1.9 million people would not have access to quality, dependable 
health insurance coverage.
  Vote ``no'' on this repeal.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I now am pleased to yield such time as she 
may consume to the author of the bill and a true leader in this effort, 
in this fight, the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Bachmann).
  Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to listen to the clear, distinct voice of the 
American people. They have spoken loudly. They have spoken clearly. 
They heard the words of then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi when she 
famously said we must pass ObamaCare before we can know what's in it. 
As my colleague, Steve Scalise, said, now we know what's in the bill, 
and now we know why ObamaCare is less popular today than even before it 
was passed for the first time. Because you see, Mr. Speaker, the more 
we learn about ObamaCare, the more unpopular it becomes.
  Even a Democrat, Max Baucus, who helped write ObamaCare said:

       I just tell you, I see a huge train wreck coming down.

  Well, I ask you, Mr. Speaker, 7 months from now when ObamaCare comes 
fully online, when people's health care premiums will soar through the 
roof, in some cases increasing 417 percent, what then, Mr. Speaker?
  We see this coming, just like the Titanic. We see the iceberg, only 
it's not just in a mist, shortly in front of our eyes. We have time to 
turn. That's why we're here. We're here to make the turn from a train 
wreck.
  So why not repeal that bill today? Repeal it in the House, but repeal 
it in the U.S. Senate, and force the President of the United States to 
repudiate his signature piece of legislation under his watch, which his 
own party calls a train wreck. It's now. Now is the time to listen to 
the American people.
  You see, Mr. Speaker, President Obama told us, he promised us that 
ObamaCare would fund insurance for people with preexisting conditions. 
As a compassionate people, we want to help people in this very 
difficult situation. But ObamaCare, the truth is that it is so poorly 
thought out that the funding for preexisting conditions has already run 
out. You heard me right, Mr. Speaker: less than 1 percent of the 
American people with preexisting conditions got the funding and now the 
door has been slammed in their face.
  And so I ask you, Mr. Speaker, what now? What are the remaining 99 
percent of the American people with preexisting conditions supposed to 
do now? Now they're told we've already run out of money, and the bill 
hasn't even fully come into effect, the centerpiece of compassion under 
this bill.
  And now we've learned that the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service--and 
I used to be a Federal tax litigation attorney, and our client was the 
IRS. I was involved with this agency. Now we've learned that the IRS, 
which is tasked with enforcing this very unpopular bill of ObamaCare, 
the IRS admitted they targeted Americans. They targeted conservative 
groups. They targeted Christians. They targeted pro-Israel people. They 
targeted people who are pro-business who are against accumulating debt. 
And, yes, they targeted Tea Party groups based upon their political and 
religious beliefs.
  And so this gargantuan government expansion known as ObamaCare will 
allow bureaucrats access to our most intimate, personal health care 
information. It will be a huge database that government is putting 
together and building right now.
  Under ObamaCare, the average American will pay more, they'll get 
less, and now they have to worry that their government may punish them 
because of their beliefs.

                              {time}  1320

  This is America. We don't do that in this country.
  We want real solutions. We want cures for Alzheimer's. We can have 
it. We want cures for Parkinson's disease. It's within our grasp. We 
want cures for juvenile diabetes.
  Spend our money there. We deserve better. The American people deserve 
better solutions and real reform in health care. Now is the time. 
Listen to the American people, and let's give them what they deserve.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).
  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her 
extraordinary leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Patients' Rights 
Repeal Act and the underlying rule.
  More than 3 years ago, following months of vitriolic debate and 
perpetual Republican talking points on socialized medicine and 
government-sponsored death panels, Congress passed, and the President 
signed into law, a historic health care reform bill that was designed 
to extend health care to millions of Americans and, over time, bring 
down the costs of health care.
  Opponents of this new law didn't give up. They took their case all 
the way to the Supreme Court, and they lost. In the House, they held 36 
votes to repeal or defund this law, and they failed.
  According to an analysis from CBS News, these empty attempts at 
repeal

[[Page H2674]]

have cost taxpayers a total of $52.4 million, even as my Republican 
friends argue for cutting important programs like Head Start and 
critical nutrition programs for those most in need.
  Yet here we stand, about to vote, for a 37th time, on repealing a 
bill that is already providing real benefits for our country.
  Contrary to what my friends on the other side of the aisle may argue, 
we've already seen a slowdown in the overall growth of health care 
spending since the enactment of this law.
  And just in my home State of Rhode Island, more than 170,000 women 
have guaranteed access to preventive services without cost-sharing; 
374,000 Rhode Islanders no longer have to worry about lifetime limits 
on their coverage; and 9,000 young adults have gained access to health 
care coverage because of this law.
  Let's reject this proposal, stop playing these political games, and 
get back to the really serious and urgent work of creating jobs, 
preventing gun violence, fixing our broken immigration system, passing 
a budget by regular order, and ending the sequester.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I ask as to the time remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 17 minutes 
remaining. The gentlewoman from New York has 14 minutes remaining.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp).

supporters promised us many things in ObamaCare. So.."

        CBC HOUR: THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs. 
Christensen) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks 
and add extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, tonight the Congressional Black Caucus 
again thanks the Democratic leader for allowing us to have this hour to 
talk about something very important.
  As we approach the second anniversary of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, a truly landmark law that's bringing about health 
reforms that are helping millions of Americans not only save money but 
have healthier lives, we want to review some of those facts this 
evening, not the myths, not the misrepresentations about this great 
law, the facts.
  There's so much that's being spread that is just flat-out wrong, 
wrong about the facts and wrong to tell our fellow Americans things 
that are just not true about this law.
  At this time, I would like to begin yielding to some of my 
colleagues. I will begin by yielding such time as she might consume to 
the gentlelady from Cleveland, Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge.
  Ms. FUDGE. Thank you so much. And I want to thank Representative 
Christensen for continuing to host this hour. Thank you very much for 
your leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, for far too long, hardworking Americans have paid the 
price for policies that handed free reign to insurance companies and 
put barriers between patients and their doctors. We all want to be in 
charge of our own care, and it is not too much to ask. The Affordable 
Care Act forces insurance companies to be responsible, prohibiting them 
from dropping your coverage if you get sick or billing you into 
bankruptcy because of an annual or lifetime limit.
  For the first time, under Federal law, insurance companies are 
required to publicly justify their actions if they want to raise rates 
by 10 percent or more. The law also bans insurance companies from 
imposing lifetime dollar limits on health benefits, freeing cancer 
patients and individuals suffering from other chronic diseases from 
worrying about going without treatment.
  The law also ensures that everyone pays their fair share and gets 
affordable insurance because, when people without insurance get sick, 
the costs get passed down to the rest of us. Despite other claims, you 
can keep the coverage you have if you want it, or, if you like your 
plan, you don't have to keep it. You can pick an affordable insurance 
option so that you can take responsibility for your health and your 
family's health.
  Having everyone take responsibility for their own care started as a 
Republican idea, but unfortunately they have abandoned it in an effort 
to dismantle the new health care law. We know that the American people 
strongly support what the new health care law does, even though 
Republican rhetoric has encouraged many not to support the law. When 
you ask about specific provisions, you get a much clearer picture.

                              {time}  1910

  According to a poll done by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 85 percent 
of people support the discount seniors will get in prescription drugs, 
which began this year. Seventy-nine percent support subsidies to help 
low- and moderate-income people buy insurance, which is scheduled to 
start in 2014. Seventy-eight percent support tax credits to small 
businesses to offer coverage to workers. The credits are available 
starting this year. Seventy-one percent of people support prohibiting 
insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions, a 
provision that goes into effect in 2014. Sixty-six percent support 
making insurers meet a threshold of spending on actual medical care as 
opposed to administrative costs and profits. This provision goes into 
effect this year. Sixty-five percent support the law's provision making 
some preventive care services free to Medicare beneficiaries. It's now 
in effect. I won't keep going, but I could, Mr. Speaker.
  Americans support the provisions of the Affordable Care Act because 
it gives them the reins. It gives them the ability to choose, not the 
insurance companies. Americans overwhelmingly agree that the health 
care system we had before was broken.
  The Affordable Care Act is already helping millions of Americans as 
well as small businesses. 105 million Americans have had the lifetime 
limit on their coverage eliminated. Seventeen million children who have 
preexisting conditions can no longer be denied coverage by insurers. 
Two and a half million additional young adults now have health 
insurance through their parents. 360,000 small employers used the small 
business health care tax credit to help them afford health insurance 
for 2 million workers in 2011. $2.1 billion is the amount that seniors 
in the doughnut hole have already saved on their prescription drugs. 
That's an Average of $604 per senior.

[[Page H1379]]

  Another fundamental element of the law is the support it provides to 
community health centers. The Affordable Care Act increases the funding 
available to 179 existing community health centers in Ohio alone. 
Health centers in Ohio have received over $53 million to create new 
health center sites in medically underserved areas and enable health 
centers to increase the numbers of patients served. The funds can be 
used to expand preventive and primary health care services. And for so 
many Ohioans, including my constituents, community health centers are 
absolutely vital.
  For many reasons, this law will improve care and make Americans more 
healthy. It helps us keep costs under control, encourages prevention, 
and lets American families focus on things other than whether they will 
be able to get the type of care they need or go bankrupt. This bill 
saves lives.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Thank you, Congresswoman Fudge. And thank you for 
reminding us that such a large percentage of Americans, once they 
really know what's in the bill and what is being provided, support the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  At this time, I would like to yield such time as she might consume to 
the Congresswoman, the gentlelady from Texas who often joins 
Congresswoman Fudge and myself on these Special Orders, Congresswoman 
Sheila Jackson Lee.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank the gentlelady for her kindness.
  As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the cochair and 
founder of the Congressional Children's Caucus, and a member of the 
Health Care Task Force, it is now time to commemorate--even to 
celebrate--2 years of the Affordable Care Act, particularly coming from 
an area that embraces the Texas Medical Center, where so much research 
has benefited from the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the added 
commitment to research for any number of diseases that we are still 
confronted with. So I am baffled by the opposition to this bill and the 
usage that it has seemingly come upon during the Republican 
Presidential debates. For, in actuality, if they would read the bill 
and look at its basic premises, they would take up the cause of saying 
that it is a very important element of making Americans more healthy.
  And I thank the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands for her leadership 
on health care issues and, of course, for leading this Special Order 
and, as well, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus for making 
sure that we are focused on how this impacts our community.
  Children, in particular, won't lose their coverage just because they 
were born with preexisting conditions like asthma. And American 
families are seeing how reform is saving lives and saving money. 
Medicare is now stronger for seniors, and women can now get lifesaving 
mammograms at no extra cost. In eliminating racial and ethnic health 
disparities, which we worked on continuously and, as a caucus, 
submitted this language to the Affordable Care Act, we find that it 
would have reduced direct medical care expenditures by $229.4 billion 
for the years 2003 to 2006. This bill was passed after that. And even 
though all the language that the CBC wanted to include in that bill was 
not included, large steps were made in terms of the elements of that 
bill.
  This bill protects and provides for the fact that if you have an 
illness that is chronic, you do not have lifetime caps. Eighty-six 
million Americans receive free preventative care; that means they get 
lifesaving cancer screenings like mammograms and colonoscopies, and 
soon women can have their contraceptives covered without paying a copay 
or deductible. They are living healthier lives.
  There is evidence, unfortunately, that over the years has shown that 
for infant mortality rates of mothers age 20-plus, race, ethnicity, and 
education makes a difference. For mothers with less than high school, 
it is high among all populations, including white women. High school, 
it is almost equally as high: 13.4 African Americans per 1,000 births; 
9.2 American Indians per 1,000 births; 6.5 white/non-Hispanic; 5.6 
Asian/Pacific Islander; and 5.3 Hispanic.
  It is shameful that we lose our newborns because of lack of health 
care and education. The Affordable Care Act will change that because it 
will create greater opportunities for access to health care. 180 
million are now protected against the worst insurance abuses, like 
denying health care to the sick, excessive premium increases, and 
lifetime caps. An additional 2.5 million young adults now have 
insurance. That's because the Affordable Care Act allows families, 
parents, to keep their children on insurance until age 26. I have 
personally spoken to families who have said, Thank you. And lives have 
been saved.

  What is the Affordable Care Act? It is saving lives. Forty-seven 
million Americans now benefit from a stronger Medicare program. The 
solvency of the program has been extended by 8 years. New prescription 
drug discounts have saved 3.6 million seniors on Medicare an average of 
$600, and seniors understand that in just a few years to come, the 
doughnut hole will be completely closed. The worst Medicare reform we 
ever saw--and it was not reformed. It was actually a blight on Medicare 
to have something called the prescription drug part D with a big fat 
doughnut hole, which most seniors fell in and almost drowned. Thank 
goodness we are ending that aspect of it.
  But let me tell you why it's important to have the Affordable Care 
Act. Coming from the State that I do and having experienced this past 
week, over the last 10 days, as we've been fighting this--and it is 
galvanizing--as Planned Parenthood has gone around the State of Texas, 
and as we watch various State laws infringe upon women's health care 
and access to health care--if you can imagine, a sonogram that forces a 
woman to look at a sonogram along with her physician. This should be a 
prayerful and private moment where laws do not intrude on a private 
decision. Or the law that says that you have to tell your employer what 
reason you are using contraception for. These are outrageous aspects. 
Or Planned Parenthood affiliates that have nothing to do with abortion 
in the State of Texas now are eliminated from receiving precious 
Medicaid dollars in the State of Texas, which has the highest number of 
uninsured, mostly among young women and single women with children.

                              {time}  1920

  They are denying them access to health care because they are claiming 
that affiliates are performing abortions. They know that is not true. 
We're going to fight it, we're going to fight it, and we're going to 
fight it. One of the reasons is because the Affordable Care Act 
provides equal opportunity to access health care. It is shameful that 
the State of Texas is turning away some $30 million to $40 million to 
help women have access to health care. It is shameful that they've 
already cut $76.9 million.
  So I want to thank Representative Garnet Coleman, Representative 
Sylvester Turner, Representative Alma Allen, Representative Carol 
Alvarado, and a number of others who recognize that the State should 
take a different position and are working with me to turn the clock 
forward and not backwards in terms of health care for women in the 
State of Texas. We need all the help we can get. And the Affordable 
Care Act, a reasoned response to good health care, is providing that 
legitimate law to say that all Americans deserve access to good health 
care.
  For my district, it improves employer-based coverage for 279,000 
residents. That is the 18th Congressional District in the State of 
Texas. It provides credits to help pay for coverage for up to 186,000 
households; improves Medicare for 70,000 beneficiaries--seniors--
including closing the prescription drug doughnut hole for 5,300 
seniors. It allows 16,600 small businesses to obtain affordable health 
care.
  If we say we care about small businesses--I hear that all the time--
then why are you condemning the Affordable Care Act that helps small 
business provide tax credits to help reduce health care insurance for 
up to 14,600 small businesses in the 18th Congressional District in 
Texas? Multiply that by 435 districts. There are millions of small 
businesses being helped.
  It provides coverage for 187,000 uninsured residents. Remember, I 
said Texas is the State with the highest number of uninsured persons 
without

[[Page H1380]]

health care. It protects up to 500 families from bankruptcy due to 
unaffordable health care costs. And when we were dealing with 
bankruptcies in the Judiciary Committee, one of the single most 
difficult elements of bankruptcy was catastrophic illnesses. It 
provides better health care coverage for the insured. Approximately 41 
percent of the district's population of 279,000 will receive coverage 
from their employer.
  There are many other aspects of what this insurance reform, 
Affordable Care Act, good health care does for Americans. And so I am 
happy to celebrate the Affordable Care Act because I believe that lives 
have been saved. Children with diabetes or children with preexisting 
diseases that would not have access to health care, other than the 
emergency room, now can get good coverage and good care.
  Finally, I would say something that we collectively supported that 
has been an asset in my congressional district is that a health clinic 
has received millions of dollars through the stimulus pursuant to our 
commitment to community health clinics and now has 20 patient rooms, 
increased jobs, and is providing good health care in that community. 
Community health clinics have become first-line responders to providing 
access to all people.
  So I thank the gentlelady for allowing me to share these thoughts, 
but in particular I thank her for helping me acknowledge the fight we 
have in Texas, where women's access to health care foolishly has been 
denied. And incorrectly, I believe, labeling Planned Parenthood and its 
affiliates--in particular the affiliates, who have over the years 
through the Bush administration when President Bush was in office--this 
bill was passed in the State of Texas--but the affiliates were allowed 
to continue to give good health care, and no question was ever raised 
that they were mixing Federal dollars in their clinics that might have 
provided for abortions. It is against the law.
  Why we are denying women in the State of Texas their health care, 
their lifeline, baffles all of us. But we're going to fight to the end, 
and look forward to working with Health and Human Services to ensure 
that we can fight for good health care for all Americans and the women 
of the State of Texas.
  I rise today to celebrate the 2nd anniversary of the Affordable 
Health Care Act. After years of trying to ensure that all Americans 
will have access to health care, we passed a measure which is a step in 
the right direction to one day guaranteeing that every American will 
have access to affordable care. In March 2010, we passed and President 
Obama signed into law historic health care reform legislation, the 
Affordable Care Act (ACA).
  As the founding Member of the Children's Caucus and Active Member of 
the Women's Caucus I am keenly aware that having access to affordable 
health care will result in healthier families. As a Representative from 
the State of Texas I realize the importance of the ACA. Texas has the 
highest rate of uninsured individuals in the U.S. including the working 
uninsured or under insured.
  Because of the ACA millions of Americans are already benefitting from 
this law: insurers are no longer allowed to discriminate against 
children and others who are sick; small businesses are receiving 
billions of dollars in tax credits to provide health care coverage for 
their employees; and seniors are saving money on prescription drugs and 
receiving free preventive care through Medicare.
  In the 2 years since the President signed his health reforms into 
law, millions of Americans have already experienced firsthand its 
important benefits and the economic security it provides.
  Medicare is now stronger for seniors, and women can now get life-
saving mammograms at no extra cost.
  Children won't lose their coverage just because they were born with 
pre-existing conditions like asthma--and American families are seeing 
how reform is saving lives and saving money.
  Since we passed reform almost 2 years ago, Americans have seen its 
positive impact:
  Eighty-six million Americans received free preventive care. That 
means they got live-saving cancer screenings like mammograms and 
colonoscopies, and soon women can have their contraception covered 
without paying a co-pay or deductible. They're living healthier lives 
while saving money at the same time.
  One hundred eighty million are now protected against the worst 
insurance abuses, like denying health care to the sick, excessive 
premium increases and lifetime caps on the amount of care a patient can 
receive, and soon will be protected against gender discrimination.
  An additional 2.5 million young adults now have insurance. That's 
because President Obama's health reform made sure they could stay on 
parents' plans as they enter the workforce, until they turn 26.
  Forty-seven million Americans now benefit from a stronger Medicare 
program. The solvency of the program has been extended by 8 years, and 
new prescription drug discounts have saved 3.6 million people with 
Medicare an average of $600.
  That's just the beginning. As the law continues to phase in over the 
coming months, so will more of its benefits. New reforms will lower 
costs and raise the quality of care. Seniors will see their Medicare 
coverage continue to improve, and see the doughnut hole completely 
close.
  And in 2 years, every single American, regardless of their 
circumstances--whether they want to change jobs, start a business or 
retire early, or even if they lose their job--will have access to 
affordable, quality health insurance. Presidents have been trying to 
make that happen for 70 years. President Obama got it done.
  Since March 23, 2010, every family with insurance has gained 
important new protections, and by 2014 the law will make sure all 
Americans have access to affordable health insurance.


                 PREVENTATIVE CARE--RACIAL DISPARITIES

  It is common knowledge that preventive care can save money and save 
lives, but too often people forego needed preventive services because 
of cost. Millions of African Americans have not gotten the preventive 
services they need.
  Twenty percent of African American women are not up to date on their 
Pap smear.
  Thirty-two percent of African American women are not up to date on 
their mammograms.
  Forty-five percent of African Americans have never had a colon cancer 
screening.
  The Affordable Care Act takes important steps to reverse this trend 
and make sure all Americans can afford the preventive care they need.
  The law prohibits private insurance companies from charging a co-pay 
or deductible for recommended preventive services, like mammograms, 
colon cancer screenings, flu shots and other immunizations, regular 
well-baby and well-child visits with a pediatrician, and soon, 
contraception. In 2011, 5.5 million African-Americans with private 
insurance saw their coverage for prevention expanded because of the 
health care law.
  The law also made preventive services available to Medicare 
beneficiaries with no co-pay or deductible. In 2011, Medicare provided 
2.4 million African-Americans with a free preventive service. 
Altogether, more than 73 percent of those eligible received at least 
one free service.


                          INSURANCE COMPANIES

  Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could arbitrarily 
cap and cancel families' benefits, or refuse to cover kids just because 
they were born with a pre-existing condition.
  Before the law, 105 million Americans had lifetime caps on their 
care, including 10.4 million African-Americans.
  Up to 129 million Americans under the age of 65 have a health 
condition that could make it hard to find their own insurance.
  Before the health care law, some insurance companies spent as much as 
40 percent of premiums on administrative overhead like marketing and 
CEO bonuses.
  Today, the health care law has put an end to some of the worst 
insurance industry abuses. The law is making sure that families' 
insurance is really there for them when they need it by keeping 
insurance companies from taking advantage of consumers.
  Lifetime caps have been banned for good.
  Under the law, in 2014 insurance companies will be prohibited from 
denying coverage or charging more because of anyone's pre-existing 
condition.
  Already because of the health care law, no insurance company can deny 
coverage to the up to 17 million children with pre-existing conditions 
like asthma and diabetes.
  The health care law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 
percent of premiums on health care and quality improvement.
  If an insurance company wants to raise rates by 10 percent or more, 
they have to justify their actions.


                                MEDICARE

  I believe that Medicare is an essential program that must be kept 
strong for today's seniors and future generations. That's why the 
health care law filled gaps and improved coverage for every single 
person with Medicare, while removing wasteful subsidies for insurance 
companies.
  Medicare provides coverage for more than 47 million Americans, 
including 4.9 million African-Americans.

[[Page H1381]]

  The Affordable Care Act is closing the gap in prescription drug 
coverage. In 2011 alone, 3.6 million people who hit the Medicare donut 
hole saved an average of $600 each on their prescription medications 
thanks to provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
  By 2020, the donut hole will be closed for good.
  Even as seniors gain these important new benefits, the health care 
law extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by eight years.


                 UNDER 25--Can continue to have Parents

  The health care law makes sure that young people who are working hard 
to begin their careers can stay on their family health insurance plan 
until they turn 26.
  Before health reform was enacted, young adults were the age group 
most likely to be uninsured.
  Today, 410,000 young African-Americans who would otherwise be 
uninsured have coverage because of this rule.


                             WOMEN'S HEALTH

  Before the health care law, insurance companies were free to 
discriminate against women.
  Women could be charged as much as 50 percent more than men for the 
same insurance coverage.
  Women could be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition 
such as cancer or even having been pregnant.
  Because of the health care law, within 2 years, insurance companies 
will no longer be allowed to do this.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies will no longer be 
able to deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions nor will they 
be able to charge higher rates based on an individual's gender.
  In 2014, all Americans soon will have access to the security that 
health insurance provides.
  Health care is a cornerstone of economic security, but too many 
African-American families have gone without insurance. In fact, an 
estimated 8.1 million African-Americans do not have health insurance.


                      18th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

  As I have said before it is almost hard to believe that it has only 
been 2 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, but 
millions of Americans are already seeing lower costs and better 
coverage, this includes hundreds of thousands of people living in the 
18th Congressional District of the State of Texas.
  Residents of my District--ranging from young adults to seniors to 
children with pre-existing conditions--are all already receiving 
critical benefits from this new health care law. As the new benefits of 
the health care law continue to be implemented, I will continue to 
fight my Republican colleagues' efforts to repeal this critical law. 
Their efforts to repeal reform will put the insurance companies back in 
charge and will lead to higher costs and reduced benefits for millions 
of Americans across the country.


                    ACA FACTS FOR THE 18th DISTRICT

  Improve employer-based coverage for 279,000 residents.
  Provide credits to help pay for coverage for up to 186,000 
households.
  Improve Medicare for 70,000 beneficiaries, including closing the 
prescription drug donut hole for 5,300 seniors in my District.
  Allow 16,600 small businesses to obtain affordable health care 
coverage and provide tax credits to help reduce health insurance costs 
for up to 14,600 small businesses.
  Provide coverage for 187,000 uninsured residents.
  Protect up to 500 families from bankruptcy due to unaffordable health 
care costs.
  Reduce the cost of uncompensated care for hospitals and health care 
providers by $49 million.
  Better health care coverage for the insured. Approximately 41 percent 
of the district's population, 279,000 residents, receives health care 
coverage from their employer. Under the legislation, individuals and 
families with employer-based coverage can keep the health insurance 
coverage they have now, and it will get better.
  As a result of the insurance reforms in the bill, there will be no 
co-pays or deductibles for preventive care; no more rate increases or 
coverage denials for pre-existing conditions, gender, or occupation; 
and guaranteed oral, vision, and hearing benefits for children.
  Affordable health care for the uninsured. Those who do not receive 
health care coverage through their employer will be able to purchase 
coverage at group rates through a health insurance exchange.
  Individuals and families with an income of up to four times the 
federal poverty level--an income of up to $88,000 for a family of 
four--will receive affordability credits to help cover the cost of 
coverage. Currently, there are 186,000 households in my district that 
could qualify for these affordability credits if they need to purchase 
their own coverage.
  Coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. There are 
27,600 individuals in the district that I represent who have pre-
existing medical conditions that could prevent them from buying 
insurance. Under the ACA's insurance reforms, they will now be able to 
purchase affordable coverage.
  Health care and financial security. There were 500 health care-
related bankruptcies in my district in 2008, caused primarily by the 
health care costs not covered by insurance. The bill caps annual out-
of-pocket costs at $5,000 for singles and $10,000 for families and 
eliminates lifetime limits on insurance coverage, ensuring that no 
citizen will have to face financial ruin because of high health care 
costs.
  Security for Seniors Improving Medicare. There are 70,000 Medicare 
beneficiaries in my district. The health care reform legislation 
improves Medicare by providing free preventive and wellness care, 
improving primary and coordinated care, improving nursing home quality, 
and strengthening the Medicare Trust Fund.
  Closing the Part D donut hole. Each year, 5,300 seniors in the 
district hit the donut hole and are forced to pay their full drug 
costs, despite having Part D drug coverage. The legislation will 
provide these seniors with immediate relief, covering the first $500 of 
donut hole costs in 2010, cutting brand-name drug costs in the donut 
hole by 50 percent, and completely eliminating the donut hole by 2019.


                             SMALL BUSINESS

  Helping small businesses obtain health insurance. Under the 
legislation, businesses with up to 100 employees will be able to join 
the health insurance exchange, benefitting from group rates and a 
greater choice of insurers. There are 16,600 small businesses in my 
district that will be able to join the health insurance exchange.
  Tax credits for small businesses. Small businesses with 25 employees 
or less and average wages of less than $40,000 will qualify for tax 
credits of up to 50 percent of the cost of providing health insurance. 
There are up to 14,600 small businesses in the district that could 
qualify for credits.
  I yield back. I thank the gentlelady.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. 
Certainly, we know that Planned Parenthood has always followed the law. 
And in this Women's History Month, thank you for raising the issue of 
the unfair treatment of women by some of the laws like the one in 
Texas, the one in Virginia, and also legislation that has been 
attempted to be passed in the Congress of the United States.
  We're also joined this evening by a Congressman from Texas, 
Congressman Al Green, who often joins us here. We're representing all 
of the 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who know how 
important this law is to our communities and, really, to communities 
across this country. So we thank you for joining us.
  I yield such time as he may consume.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Dr. Christensen. I especially thank 
you for chairing the Health Care Task Force and for the outstanding job 
that you've done through the years. You have shown a great deal of 
dedication to health care for all, and I believe that those who write 
history will be exceedingly kind to you when they record how you fought 
so that every person could have health care as a matter of right as 
opposed to as a matter of wealth. You have done your best to make sure 
health care doesn't become wealth care.
  I would also like to thank my colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee, who 
spoke just ahead of me and you, for the hard work that she is doing 
across the length and breadth of this country to help us with these 
issues concerning health care for all as well.
  The Affordable Care Act is called the Affordable Care Act for a 
reason. In 2009, when we were embarking upon this transformation in 
health care, we were spending about $2.5 trillion per year on health 
care. And $2.5 trillion is a huge number. It is very difficult to grasp 
$2.5 trillion. That $2.5 trillion is about $79,000 per second. That's 
what we were spending in 2009. That was .."

[Pages S1133-S1134]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the last many months millions of 
Americans have signed up for affordable health insurance, many for the 
first time ever, many for the first time in many years.
  Millions of young people have stayed on their parents' insurance 
plans while they pursue higher education to start their first jobs.
  Millions of senior citizens have saved money on prescriptions--these 
prescription bills, they average about $1,200 they have saved, each 
senior--and tens of millions of women have access to free preventive 
care.
  Across the country, Americans who were once denied insurance because 
they suffered from something like cancer or something as simple as acne 
were able to buy affordable, quality health insurance they could afford 
and they could trust.
  Despite all that good news, there are plenty of horror stories being 
told. All of them are untrue, but they are being told all over America.
  The leukemia patient whose insurance policy was canceled and would 
die without her medication--Mr. President, that is an ad being paid for 
by two billionaire brothers that is absolutely false; or the woman 
whose insurance policy went up $700 a month--ads paid for around 
America by the multibillionaire Koch brothers, and the ad is false.
  We heard about the evils of ObamaCare, about the lives it is ruining 
in the Republican stump speeches and in ads paid for by oil magnets, 
the Koch brothers.
  But those tales turned out to be just that--tales, stories made up 
from whole cloth, lies, distorted by the Republicans to grab headlines 
or make political advertisements.
  Mr. President, these two brothers are trying to buy America. They not 
only funnel money through their Americans for Prosperity, they funnel 
money into all kinds of organizations to do the same thing that they 
are doing. They are trying to buy America. I do not believe America is 
for sale. But we will see. But do not take my word for all this. How 
about taking the word of a Noble Prize-winning economist who wrote last 
week in the New York Times:

       What the right wants are struggling average Americans, 
     preferably women, facing financial devastation from health 
     reform. So those are the tales they're telling, even though 
     they haven't been able to come up with any real examples.

  Paul Krugman writes, Republicans are ``just making [this] stuff up.'' 
It is easy to do if you have billions of dollars to spend and you are 
trying to buy America.

[[Page S1134]]

  But, Mr. President, we have our own stories to tell--true stories--
true stories of average Americans whose lives have changed for the 
better because of the Affordable Care Act, true stories of families 
that can rest easier knowing insurance companies can never again put 
profits first and people second.
  Take the story of a couple from Henderson, NV. I went to high school 
there. Their names are Jane and Brett Thomas. These are real stories. 
This story is true.
  Jane wrote to me recently to say she is ``ecstatic''--that is her 
word--to be saving $1,200 every month on a top-of-the-line family 
insurance plan thanks to ObamaCare.

  For years Jane was locked into her job as a school teacher because 
she, Brett, and their two teenage children needed guaranteed health 
insurance, and it cost a lot.
  But Jane was able to quit her teaching job to spend more time with 
her children and help her husband at the family small business. Jane 
says the Affordable Care Act has literally changed her life and the 
lives of her loved ones. This is what she wrote:

       Everyone on the news keeps talking of all the people the 
     law has hurt.

  An editorial comment from me: Koch brothers' lies.
  I will go back and start over:

       Everyone on the news keeps talking of all the people the 
     law has hurt, but I thought I should share our joy. The best 
     part is our insurance covers so much more and pays better on 
     every front. . . . I can't thank you and your colleagues 
     enough for fighting for people like me and my family.

  Republicans may need tall tales and outright lies to convince people 
that ObamaCare is bad for them, but Democrats do not have to make 
things up. We have the support of lots of people, including a Nobel 
Prize-winning economist, not ``OilCare'' magnets who are trying to 
benefit their businesses by spreading lies about things that do not 
matter to them.
  Millions of real Americans, like Jane and Brett Thomas, are 
benefiting from ObamaCare every day. Their premiums are lower. Their 
prescriptions are cheaper. They cannot be denied a policy or 
discriminated against. Their benefits cannot be cut off because they 
get sick or reach some arbitrary cap that some insurance executive 
dreamed up. They are no longer locked into jobs they do not love or do 
not need because they cannot get insurance anywhere else.
  The Koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars 
telling Americans that ObamaCare is bad for them. It is easy to do if 
you have no conscience and are willing to lie, like they are, through 
the ads they are promoting. But the Koches should stick to what they 
know--the oil business--the oil business--where they have made their 
multibillions of dollars. The truth is simply more powerful than any 
myth, any legend or any false political ad.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. COATS. I know we will be voting shortly. The narrative out of the 
White House is that this health care plan is starting to work. That is 
not what I am hearing from home, and many are questioning this.
  The Wall Street Journal today published an analysis showing how the 
health care law will raise premium rates. We all are familiar with the 
President's promise that rates will not increase under the ObamaCare, 
Affordable Care Act. According to The Wall Street Journal, Americans--
particularly young, healthy adults--``could see insurance rates double 
or even triple when they look to buy individual coverage.'' Other 
groups, Oliver Wyman, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Milliman, all issued 
reports estimating that ObamaCare would increase premiums by up to 60 
percent.
  On and on this drama goes with broken promises. The American people 
are learning and discovering promises were made when this law was 
passed--and all through the 3\1/2\ years leading up to where we are--
and assurances were coming from the President and the White House: 
Don't worry. Your premiums won't go up, period. You can keep the doctor 
that you have, period. It is not going to cost any more money, period.
  Those promises have been broken and Hoosiers are finding out about 
this every day.
  Regardless of the statements coming out--don't worry, everything is 
going to be OK, sort of take it to the bank, trust us--that is not what 
is happening on the ground.
  People are writing to me. They are calling our office. They are 
tweeting, emailing, and doing everything they can to give us these 
horror stories, saying: Do I have to do this?
  Unfortunately, they do. Edward from Chesterton, IN, said he has spent 
countless hours on healthcare.gov searching for a health care plan. He 
discovered that the plans offered under the ObamaCare exchange had 
expensive premiums that he hadn't anticipated. In order to afford the 
monthly premiums, he has to choose the plan for

[[Page S8834]]

his family with unaffordable deductibles in order to keep his premiums 
at the level he can afford to pay. It is basically: Edward, don't get 
sick. Don't have a medical expense throughout your family every year, 
and you will be OK. But if you do, what you didn't pay in premiums you 
are going to have to pay in much higher deductibles.
  John from Martinsville, IN, was finally able to get on the 
healthcare.gov Web site. He found the bronze plan that was going to be 
at least $100 more per month. He doesn't qualify for a government 
subsidy, and he doesn't see any way this new law will be saving money 
for his family. John says the only thing he sees is that he now will be 
subsidizing the health care system even more than before the law was 
passed.
  DeWayne from Shipshewana, IN, wrote to tell me that not only is the 
small group health insurance plan his business currently offers not 
available any longer starting in 2014, but in his 15 years of 
administering the business health plans, he said he has never seen a 
rate increase this high.
  DeWayne's health insurance plan for him and his business employees 
will increase 65 percent in this coming year. DeWayne's small group 
health insurance is increasing 65 percent for 2014--and this is called 
the Affordable Care Act?
  I wish to give one more broken promise. William from Granger, IN, 
wrote and told me that his wife who works as a part-time nurse will no 
longer be offered health care since she works part-time. I assume they 
have children at home or maybe the hospital has determined they want to 
stay under that 40-hour workweek level, so they put her on part-time. I 
am not exactly sure what the case is.
  In any event, they have discovered they will have premiums rise from 
$11,544 a year under their current plan to $19,076 per year, an 
increase of over $7,500.
  He goes on to say: ``So much for [the President's promise] if you 
like your plan . . . if you like your doctor . . . your costs will go 
down by $2,500.''
  William's costs go up by $7,500.
  This isn't only Republicans in Washington highlighting these health 
care costs. These are Hoosiers from all backgrounds, Republicans, 
Democrats, and from all walks of life, sharing their stories with me 
about how they are paying the price for the President's broken 
promises.
  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

[Page H7005]
                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, millions of Americans 
are now experiencing firsthand the failures of a massive undertaking to 
roll out the Affordable Care Act. While well-intentioned, our 
colleagues who had a Democrat supermajority in the White House, the 
Senate, and this House pushed through a partisan bill ignoring warnings 
of those like myself who have worked in the health care field for 
decades.
  Prior to being elected to Congress, I spent nearly three decades in a 
nonprofit health care setting, serving my neighbors who were facing 
life-changing disease and disability. When it was time to weigh in on 
public policy, Members like me were muzzled. We were told to pass a 
bill to see what was in it. Well, that is exactly what happened, 
despite our continued dissent.
  Phones are ringing off the hooks in Members' offices. Constituents 
who have lost their health insurance policies and experienced 
unaffordable premium hikes are angry. They were made a promise by the 
President that they could keep their health plans. Now, reportedly, 
more than 5 million individuals have lost their policies. Undoubtedly, 
this is just the beginning of Americans not being able to keep the 
insurance that they like.
  One of my constituents, Sam, from Erie County, Pennsylvania, has been 
affected. He has been on the same policy that has provided him with 
adequate coverage, exactly what he was looking for, for years. He no 
longer has access to that coverage.
  Or Lisa and her husband, both self-employed and hailing from 
Punxsutawney in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania. They have five 
children--two in college, one in high school, and two working. After 
receiving notice that their effective and affordable health insurance 
policy was canceled, they have now been saddled with cost increases of 
over $20,000 a year.
  How about John from Clearfield County, who emailed my congressional 
office this week after being informed by his insurer that, due to 
changes under the Affordable Care Act, his policy is now canceled. He 
owns a small business that no longer qualifies for the group plan under 
the law's requirements.
  Then there is Sonya from northeast Pennsylvania, right on the shores 
of Lake Erie. She has had the same policy for the last 4 years, and it 
is being canceled. She stated that it is unfair she should have to buy 
more expensive insurance; not to mention, she says, it will cost much 
more over the long run when you factor in her new deductible.
  Madam Speaker, this is an outrage. These are just several of 
countless examples--I want to say ``endless examples''--of real harm 
being experienced by hardworking Americans, my constituents, as a 
result of this flawed law.
  Madam Speaker, the time I have been granted on this floor is not 
sufficient for me to share the growing number of voices from the Fifth 
District of Pennsylvania who are having their policies canceled and 
being forced to buy insurance that they can't afford, that they don't 
want and they don't need.
  Those at the White House that masterminded this catastrophic attack 
on insurance affordability and choice released their preliminary 
numbers for winners and losers yesterday. Nationwide, roughly 100,000 
have obtained insurance policies through the national and State 
exchanges combined. Many of these individuals, unfortunately, are now 
experiencing the sticker shock of significant costs when premiums and 
deductible expenses are combined and considered. The sad part is that 
these are the winners. That is just how bad this health care law is. 
Americans deserve access to health insurance that they choose and can 
afford.
  Madam Speaker, a large block of Members in this body are standing up 
and putting forward solutions to these failures, including some of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
  Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat from Louisiana, recently announced 
she would propose legislation to ensure all Americans could keep their 
existing insurance coverage under ObamaCare. But ``it's not just red-
State Democrats,'' as Politico reports today. Senator Dianne Feinstein, 
a Democrat from California, yesterday announced she would support the 
bipartisan effort to allow Americans to keep the plans they know and 
like.
  Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, these proposals that are being put 
forward by my Democratic colleagues mean that we would have to change 
the law. Unfortunately, Senate Leader Reid doesn't like the optics of 
having this debate on its merits, even if it would help Americans keep 
the insurance they know and like, as the President repeatedly promised.
  I want to thank the growing number of my colleagues for doing what is 
right and placing good policy before politics. This law is flawed. It 
is sinking by its own weight. Now we must act to fix its fatal flaws. 
If we don't, those who want to protect the political reputation of the 
White House will allow it to continue, no matter how much harm is 
caused upon the American people.
  Madam Speaker, the American people deserve better.

                  HISTORY AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. Wenstrup) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, we have heard much debate over the last 
week, arguments and accusations being made from both sides. I have 
heard references to being terrorists, to jihad, and to having bombs 
strapped to our chests.
  Mr. Speaker, I spent 1 year, 2005-2006, perhaps the bloodiest time of 
the war, as an Army combat surgeon in Iraq. In this Chamber I have seen 
no terrorists, no jihad, nor any bombs strapped to chests. And if you 
have been to war, you would not use such rhetoric here.
  Mr. Speaker, colleagues, we have engaged in so much debate concerning 
the Affordable Care Act. We have addressed it from every angle, the 
affordability, the methods of implementation, those that may benefit 
and those that will not. I have contended that as a Nation we should 
have focused on who is uncared for in our Nation and how we provide 
care. Addressing the uninsured would certainly fall under this 
framework. And I have contended that a form, a mere piece of paper that 
says you have insurance or a plan, does not mean that you have access 
to care, nor does it mean that you have coverage for treatment.
  Many from one side of the aisle have said, ``You lost the election, 
get over it.'' Indeed, the Republicans lost the Presidential election. 
And I am over it. However, all of us in this body won elections. Each 
of us was elected to serve the American people as well. And while the 
President has a seat at the head of the table, he does not have the 
only seat at the table. And we all need to take our seats at the table.
  I look forward, not backward, except to learn from history. I am over 
the Presidential election. What I am not over is what we are becoming. 
What we are becoming is of great concern to me, as much concern to me 
as the Affordable Care Act itself. I have a concern about who we are, 
and what we consider to be right, and what we think is wrong. And I 
hope that everyone has taken the opportunity to look at our past. Our 
glorious history is all around us.
  As you look around and you review our great history, you see the 
legacies left from previous generations. What is our legacy? What will 
this generation, this Congress leave behind? Will it be that we have a 
disregard for the law, a disregard for laws that we voted on and 
signed? Waivers, exemptions, special subsidies, all of which show a 
disregard for applying laws equally, as well as a disregard for the 
rule of law.
  Applying laws equally, the rule of law, the very ideals that 
Americans have proudly touted for over two centuries. Are we deciding 
to abandon these core values? Is this the way we want to carve out our 
chapter in American history? The history of a great

[[Page H6183]]

Nation? A Nation that was formed to be of the people, by the people, 
and for the people. This concept and the freedom that comes with it 
requires a level of responsibility in order to sustain it.
  Pope John Paul II, when visiting America in 1995, spoke of the 
freedom that we enjoy and the responsibility that comes with it. And he 
summed it up by saying, ``Freedom consists not in doing what we like, 
but in having the right to do what we ought.'' I pray that the rule of 
law, and equality for all Americans, our fundamental principles that 
are etched in all of our hearts, with the foundation of these 
principles and the civility that accompanies such, we are obligated to 
come together to find common ground and to talk to one another. And, 
Lord willing, we will.

                   AFFORDABLE CARE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Madam Speaker, we need to amend a fundamentally unfair 
provision within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better 
known as ObamaCare. That is, many of the very people who have been 
responsible for writing, advocating for, passing, signing into law, and 
promulgating rules governing the implementation of ObamaCare are exempt 
from the coverage requirements mandated by this law.
  That is why I am introducing the Affordable Care Accountability Act. 
This legislation will require the President, the Vice President, all of 
the Cabinet Secretaries, all political appointees, all Members of 
Congress, and all congressional staff, including those from committees 
and leadership, to receive their health care insurance coverage through 
the insurance exchanges required under ObamaCare.
  Americans deserve to know that their government officials will never 
seek to pass legislation only to exempt themselves from all of its 
provisions.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I got the chance to meet David Weis, a 22-
year-old student at Georgetown University, about a week ago. David's 
story, unfortunately, although it may sound exceptional, is not. He was 
just about to celebrate his 19th birthday, when 2 days before it, in 
2010, he was diagnosed with thyroid and lymphatic cancer--a devastating 
diagnosis that came just as he was preparing to start college.
  As most of his classmates were enjoying the first days of their 
freshman year at Georgetown University, David was dealing with a 
rigorous course of treatment for his disease that left him tired, left 
him confused, and left him anxious about his future. David had an ace 
up his sleeve, and that was the fact he had insurance. But he only has 
it as long as he is covered as a student.
  David came to the U.S. Capitol last week to testify in favor and in 
support of the Affordable Care Act, because he knows that with the 
passage of this bill his diagnosis will not be a death sentence; that 
he will be able to get the coverage he needs; and that he will be able 
to pursue his dreams when he graduates rather than have his life 
decisions dictated by his illness--having to choose a job simply 
because it provides health care or having to be locked into a career 
simply because he can't afford going without insurance to cover his 
cancer.
  David's story can be repeated hundreds of thousands of times all 
across

[[Page S1533]]

this country by young people in their teens and their twenties and in 
their thirties who thought they were invincible but who got knocked off 
their feet by a devastating disease such as cancer and who desperately 
need health care insurance at the time of that illness in order to get 
back onto their feet.
  Some of the best news that has come out over the past several months, 
as the enrollment has started to ramp up on the Affordable Care Act, 
has been the number of young people who have signed up. We have seen 
that 31 percent of all of the people who have signed up for insurance 
exchanges all across this country are 34 years or under. This is a real 
signal that young people are recognizing that, although they may feel 
as if they are going to live forever, they desperately need insurance, 
just as everyone else does. So that is why I was so glad to see 
President Obama yesterday go on the show ``Between Two Ferns,'' with 
Zach Galifianakis, to talk about the importance of young people signing 
up.
  We all know about the ``Two Ferns'' effect. Previously unknown stars 
such as Will Ferrell and Bradley Cooper went on ``Two Ferns'' and were 
catapulted to stardom. I am glad to see the ``Two Ferns'' effect has 
had the same impact on health care enrollment. Since President Obama 
went on ``Two Ferns,'' 19,000 people were referred to the Web site of 
enrollment from the ``Funny or Die'' Web site. By 6 p.m. that day the 
video had sent 32,000 people to healthcare.gov. HHS officials said 
traffic on healthcare.gov had risen by 40 percent on Tuesday to over 
890,000 visits in 1 day.
  It is a signal that when young people, through whatever means is 
available to them, find out about the benefits of the Affordable Care 
Act, they are interested and they are signing up. I hope President 
Obama uses more innovative tools and methods to try to get the word out 
to young adults in their late teens, twenties, and thirties about the 
importance of signing up for the Affordable Care Act because it is 
important. Some 70,000 adolescents and young adults are diagnosed with 
cancer every single year in this country. There are 151,000 people 
below the age of 20 living with diabetes right now. So despite the fact 
that we may think we are going to live forever or think we may not need 
coverage, young people need it as well. It is affordable.
  The President said yesterday on this show: You effectively can get 
coverage for the cost of a cell phone bill. And it is true. Having a 
cell phone is pretty important, but being able to get treatment when 
you get a serious disease is pretty important as well.
  In Connecticut the numbers are pretty reasonable. A 22-year-old in 
Hartford making a $25,000 salary--which is the salary I made in my 
first job in Hartford--can get a bronze policy for as low as $66 a 
month through Anthem. A 25-year-old living in Bridgeport making a 
little more, $30,000, can get a bronze policy for as low as $108 a 
month. About two-thirds of all young adults across the country who are 
currently uninsured are eligible for these subsidies.
  For all of these young people who were previously going to the 
marketplace and often having to pay full price, often buying insurance 
on their own with no ability to negotiate a group discount, this health 
care law is transformational. Fifty or sixty dollars a month is the 
price for bronze plans. And this doesn't even count the catastrophic 
option open to most young people as well.
  The good news continues to roll in when it comes to the numbers of 
people signing up. Yesterday the administration announced that 4.2 
million people have enrolled in marketplaces through March 1; 943,000 
people enrolled in the short month of February; and 31 percent of all 
those people are 34 or younger. And, of course, we haven't even gotten 
to crunch time yet.
  I wish this weren't the case, but I know something about how young 
people think. Too many leave big decisions until the last minute, 
whether it be studying for a test, writing a term paper, or signing up 
for health care.
  As we have seen in the past on a lot of these enrollment deadlines, 
like the enrollment deadline for Medicare Part D, the surge comes in 
the final few weeks of enrollment. So we expect to see the numbers pick 
up in a significant way through March.
  Knowing how people in their twenties and thirties think, I expect we 
will see a major surge in enrollment from young people as well. But 
they shouldn't wait until the last minute. It does take more than a few 
hours to look at the choices and decide which is best. In Connecticut 
we have three insurance plans offering coverage, but each one of them 
has three or four different plans. So I hope young adults in their 
twenties and thirties take more than a few hours or a day to sign up 
because we want to make sure they get the plan available for them. It 
is easy to do with a phone call to an enrollment center, a visit in 
Connecticut to the in-person centers in New Britain and New Haven, and 
very simple to do on healthcare.gov.
  In Connecticut our exchange is going like gangbusters. We had a goal 
of signing up 80,000 to 100,000 people, and a full 30 days before the 
deadline we have signed up 152,000 people. Of those individuals in 
Connecticut, about 25 percent are 25 years or younger. We are on track 
to double our original estimates in Connecticut.
  Connecticut is a State that had a pretty high rate of insured to 
begin with, so our delta to get to full insurance was relatively small 
compared to other States. But guess what Connecticut is doing. 
Connecticut is actually working to implement the law rather than 
working to undermine the law. We put a lot of time and thought into 
getting a working Web site, into doing the kind of outreach other 
States are not doing to get people to sign up. When we have done that, 
young people and old people across the board have flocked to sign up.
  I was glad to see the President do his outreach yesterday to young 
people all across the country. I was glad to see the spike in interest 
on healthcare.gov. I am glad to see that 4.2 million people have signed 
up for health care, as more people all across the country--young people 
especially--are realizing the Affordable Care Act works.
  I yield the floor.

[Pages S192-S193]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before I make my remarks, I commend the 
Senator from South Dakota and underscore what the Senator said 
regarding the SKILLS Act passed by the House of Representatives.
  I am the ranking member of the labor subcommittee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. Six years ago the Workforce Investment 
Act expired in its authorization, and for 6 years it has languished in 
the bowels and in the heart of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives, going unauthorized.
  During that same 6-year period of time between 2008 and today, 
America has experienced terrible unemployment, terrible job loss, 
terrible increases in unemployment, and extensions of that 
unemployment.
  The Senator from South Dakota is exactly correct: If we were doing 
our job and reauthorizing programs in the law today--such as the 
Workforce Investment Act--and training people for the skills of the 
21st century and the jobs of the 21st century, we wouldn't be talking 
about unemployment compensation, we wouldn't be talking about the great 
tragedies of America. We would be talking about America's greatest 
prosperity. So I commend the Senator from South Dakota for pointing out 
what is critically important for us to recognize as Members of the U.S. 
Congress.
  I come to the floor, though, to talk about the Affordable Care Act, I 
will tell a couple real-life stories which came to me by email. But 
before I do, my job is to do what the people of Georgia want me to do. 
I have office hours when I am home. I answer my own phone calls. I try 
to respond to the concerns they have. I try to see that people get 
referred to the right place.
  Since January 1, I have dealt with almost nothing but the Affordable 
Care Act--or ObamaCare--and the consequences of that act, and what 
effect it is having on the American people and the people of Georgia--
and, in particular, on the two great promises used on the floor of this 
Senate to sell that legislation to the American people: One, if you 
like your policy, you can keep it; and, if you like your doctor, you 
can keep him or her. Both were clear, unequivocal promises.
  I will tell two stories today that came to my attention which 
illustrate how it was not true. And these are just two of many stories. 
The first is from Jane.

       Congressman, This is not my story but my friend's story, 
     Steve. . . . He has suffered with multiple myeloma for more 
     than 10 years. This is a disease that usually kills within 5 
     years of being diagnosed. But with the excellent health care 
     he has been able to receive through his health care program 
     he has had access to the Mayo Clinic and a myriad of drugs. 
     Now he has been told that his plan will be cancelled since 
     the plan does not meet the minimum standards set forth in the 
     ACA.
       Now he can no longer continue his treatments because the 
     various plans have deemed the drugs he needs to stay alive as 
     experimental. WOW! Really that is just awful and not enough 
     is being said about this government take over of our lives is 
     affecting those that are critically ill.

  And what about the promise made that if we liked our plan we can keep 
it? Steve doesn't have a plan, but he still has multiple myeloma.
  This story comes about the promise that: If you like your doctor, you 
can keep them. This is from Felicia in Alpharetta, GA, a story I hear 
more and more as I travel my State:

       My husband and I are both currently paying individual 
     health care policies as he currently has a small business and 
     I used to own one. He is on a Kaiser HMO and I am on a PPO 
     with Blue Cross Blue Shield. We have

[[Page S193]]

     both received numerous letters with conflicting information 
     regarding changes to our current policies. We are reasonably 
     intelligent people and yet we cannot figure out what is 
     actually happening with our health care nor do we believe the 
     government has any clue what is happening with this new 
     legislation. Also, in comparing an equivalent Obama care 
     policy to my current policy, I have only 10% of the doctors 
     available in network to what I currently have and of course, 
     my doctors are not in network. Please STOP and REPEAL this 
     ridiculous legislation. I DO NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE that the 
     government can improve our current health care, only EVIDENCE 
     that it has caused much confusion, created wasted time, 
     wasted money, and driven Americans crazy!

  These are two emails sent to me out of many more I could be reading. 
But it is important for us to understand the impact the Affordable Care 
Act is having on the American people and the people of my State. In 
fact, I will share my personal experience from just over the Christmas 
holidays.
  In December, I enrolled through the DC health care plan to buy my 
health care because all of Congress was moved into the DC health 
exchange to comply with the ObamaCare legislation. I worked hard to try 
and match the same care I had before under plan 105 Blue Cross/Blue 
Shield under the government health care. I couldn't find exactly a good 
enough match of PPO, but I came close--close in everything except 
premium. The premium went up 20 percent. And I think most of the 
American people--certainly people of my age--are realizing the same 
type of experience where premiums are going up and up.
  I would suspect the reason for the Executive order to extend next 
year's open enrollment date beyond the election is in part because the 
administration suspects what I suspect; that is, the realities of less 
enrollment than thought, and fewer young people going into coverage 
than thought is going to mean higher premiums, less access, and less 
affordability.
  But let me share another story which is really poignant. Fortunately, 
I was able to help, but when I found out, it broke my heart. It is a 
story about my grandson Jack and his speech therapist.
  Jack is a great kid, a highly intelligent kid, but had some speech 
problems and so had a special speech therapist named Dr. Tim. Over the 
Christmas holidays I got to meet Dr. Tim, and we were talking about his 
job, what he does as a speech therapist, and about Jack and all of his 
improvements.

  Dr. Tim turned to me and said: I don't want to burden you with my 
personal problems, but my youngest daughter has cystic fibrosis and has 
had it into her teenage years; and I have had health care coverage up 
until a week ago, when I was notified my health coverage would no 
longer pay for the drugs it takes to keep her alive.
  For anybody in this Senate or in America who understands cystic 
fibrosis, it is a terrible debilitating disease of the lungs and people 
never used to live to the age of 21. But because of medicine, health 
care, and breakthroughs in pharmaceutical therapy, people live past the 
age of 21. In fact, we have a Georgian who lived into his 50s before he 
passed from cystic fibrosis. But they cannot live if they don't have 
the pharmaceutical therapy. And there are no substitutes and there are 
no replacements.
  This doctor lost his health care reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
for cystic fibrosis in part because of the judgments and the 
applicability of the Affordable Care Act. To his credit and to the 
credit of the health care system and the insurance industry, he was 
able to in part replace it but not nearly as close to what he had on 
the policy before.
  These are just a few stories about Americans who are experiencing 
terrible problems because of the change in our health care system.
  The promises we made are not being kept. The promises that were made 
to sell the Affordable Care Act to the American people and to the 
Congress of the United States are not being kept. It is important for 
us to understand that cannot stand. And if what happens next year 
happens as I think it will, costs will skyrocket again for the American 
people, access and affordability will go away or will not be nearly as 
good as it is, and we will have taken a health care system which was 
the envy of the world and turned it into a health care system that is 
the biggest problem in the world.
  I want things to work. I want to help the American people. I want 
them to have access to affordable health care. I want them to have 
access to their doctors and to be able to keep their policy. We need to 
work toward that as we go through the tragedies of the implementation 
in 2014 of the Health Care Act--ObamaCare--which today is America's No. 
1 personal problem for the average American citizen.
  I am grateful for the time, and I yield back the remainder of my 
time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.

                       AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, as we hear from Members of 
this House every day, I thought it would be refreshing to bring the 
people's voice directly to this floor. So I asked my constituents to 
send me their thoughts that I could deliver as a 1-minute speech.
  The following is from Susan Sigmund of San Diego, who sent me this on 
the Affordable Care Act to be reviewed by the Supreme Court. She 
offered: ``Being given the opportunity to speak before you, I wanted to 
make these 60 seconds witty, timely, and relevant to all. Having failed 
at that, I will simply discuss my main concern right now. It's the 
future of the health care law. The Supreme Court could strike it down 
next year.
  ``I have a preexisting health condition and will die in about 3 years 
unless I am able to buy a health insurance policy. I'm sure I am one of 
many facing this bleak possibility.
  ``As I understand it, if the mandate section requiring a policy goes, 
so goes the provision barring preexisting condition discrimination. If 
the time comes, please do the honorable thing and vote to allow your 
constituents with preexisting conditions to buy health care insurance. 
Lives depend on it. Thank you.''
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mrs. Sigmund for bringing to the House 
her thoughts on health care.

                     REPEALING AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) is recognized 
for 30 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, for a great number of hours today in this 
Chamber, there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act when we know fully that the chances are slim to 
move forward and the measure would not be signed into law. Is it 
political posturing? I believe it is, of a grand style.
  There's a pattern being established here. There's been an attack--
outright attack--on Social Security, attempts to privatize the system. 
It's been under attack for the last 76 years. It's been the 
underpinning that provides stability for working families across this 
great Nation. It has been a security piece that has enabled many to 
have at least assurances that there would be some support in family 
budgets as they move month to month. We know that that measure, Social 
Security, has been dealing with its enemies for a long time--since 
before it was made a law.
  Likewise, Medicare, which came to us in the mid-sixties, enabled our 
senior community to have its health care needs met, provided 
predictability and stability for retired households, enabled people to 
enjoy a quality of life, a better quality of health care. We know that 
before Medicare, many of those who had retired expected to see their 
economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing 
health care when they, perhaps, could not get that coverage in an 
insurance context.
  So Medicare, as we know it today, would be undone by the Republican 
majority in this House. They would prefer to privatize Social Security, 
allow us to reach to the financial sector to, perhaps, see a repeat of 
what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this 
past recession, where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away, 
trillions lost in the American economy, pain and suffering endured by 
families across this land. They'd rather see a voucher system for 
Medicare, handing it over to the insurance companies, to leave seniors 
digging deeper into their pockets.
  So the pattern has been established here, and now a repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act before its full implementation, before given a 
chance as we arrive as the last industrialized Nation in the world to 
provide a universal health care coverage program. Unacceptable. 
Progress is struck. A decision is rendered by the highest court in the 
land, a conservative-leaning Court. Before the ink is dry on that 
decision, a move to repeal. The Court spoke. It has spoken to America 
and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a 
decision rendered that said, yes, in fact, it meets the 
constitutionality test.
  And so this evening, on the eve of the attempts to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act as it stands, is a very telling moment. It is one 
that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo 
programs that serve our middle class so very well. And without a 
thriving middle class, our Nation is not prosperous. Without that 
thriving middle class, there's not purchasing power strong enough to 
provide the recovery of our economy. Without a strengthening of our 
middle class, there is not a confidence in the economy, a confidence 
that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base.
  And so the Affordable Care Act is offering promise and hope to 
millions, tens of millions, of Americans across this land. Whether 
you're insured, underinsured, uninsured, all categories will see 
strengthening because of this measure.
  Think of it. I represent a large proportion of senior citizens who 
are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs. Many dealing with that 
doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig 
into their pockets. We close that doughnut hole. We make more 
affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well 
and, in some cases, to have the medications that keep them alive. We 
deny that opportunity to our Nation's seniors.
  We deny the respect that we offer. We deny the dignity in the 
equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals 
that our senior community requires. That doughnut hole would have been 
closed by 2020.
  Further, at the other end of the age spectrum, many young adults, 
finding it difficult in this recession--and now the recovery period--to 
gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college, are given the 
opportunity with the Affordable Care Act to remain on their family's 
policy until the age of 26. Therein lies a strong benefit for some 6.6 
million young adults, denied with the repeal measure, denying access 
and affordability to health care situations. How many cases of young 
adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to 
turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction, that would not 
forego this opportunity for our Nation's young adults? A strong benefit 
associated with this package.
  What about those who have a preexisting condition? Some 17 million 
children in that category. And that's not to account for the many 
adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions. Asthma in 
children, diabetes in our senior community, being a woman, utilized as 
a preexisting condition, an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic 
core need that we should consider to be truly American. Another benefit 
lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in 
this House and the United States Senate and signed into law by this 
President.
  What about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold? 
Cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding 
time in their lives. Games played with people and their lives and their 
recovery; hope pulled from working families across this Nation because 
of an insensitivity of this Congress. A deplorable situation.
  Assistance to our small business community. Now, if we profess our 
small business community to be the economic engine that is part and 
parcel of our economic comeback, our economic springboard, then would 
we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area? Would 
we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business 
community? Many, a majority of those businesses will remind all of us 
as Representatives that they want to provide for their employees.

                              {time}  2140

  They want a productive workforce. That means a strong and well 
workforce. And so they see it as a strong investment; one, however, 
that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating 
costs, 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker 
coverage.
  They wanted that turned around. They wanted a smart approach, a 
businesslike approach, a sensitive response. They got it with the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Progress denied, the small business engine weakened by this sort of 
neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing Social 
Security, privatizing Social Security, changing Medicare as we know it 
forever, now repealing the Affordable Care Act. We see the pattern. We 
see the gross neglect, the disrespect for America's middle class, her 
working families.
  So we go forward and we understand that, with the opportunities of an 
exchange, small employers, our small

[[Page H4771]]

business community understands that if they're unable to enter into an 
exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the 
rules, to sharpen their pencils, roll up their sleeves, provide the 
service, live within the parameters, and allow for the many to enter 
into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits.
  Think of it. If 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be 
impacted with catastrophic illness, it's devastating, an actuarial 
impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook 
because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ.
  If those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange, a 
better outcome, a different outcome, a stronger outcome for the 
economic recovery of this Nation because the gross majority of jobs 
being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business 
community.
  And so, you know, the formula is quite obvious. We want a comeback. 
We want that strongest response here from Washington for that kick that 
we endured from a recession that drained us of 8.2 million jobs.
  The best way to do it, first of three principles, small business. 
Provide for the strengthening of small business, which the Affordable 
Care Act does, because that small business community has forever been 
the pulse of American enterprise.
  Secondly, invest in that entrepreneur, the dreamer, the mover, the 
shaker. It always stretched us, since our days of pioneer spirit with 
the Industrial Revolution and the westward movement, very familiar to 
the district I represent, which is the donor area to the Erie Canal in 
upstate New York in the capital region, Mohawk Valley. That pioneer 
spirit exists in our fabric today. It's our DNA. Invest in the 
entrepreneur. To be the ideas economy kingpin, we rely on these wizards 
to build us, sustain us, stretch us, empower us.
  And then finally, invest in a thriving middle class, which the 
Affordable Care Act does. It enables us, as a middle class community, 
to be bolstered by the confidence, the security, the stability that has 
come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability 
to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and 
not just deal with illness, that will put together efforts to cost 
contain, that will bring people into a structured program so that we 
can monitor their activities and connect them to a system.
  You know, you'll hear from some on the floor, we don't want to pay 
for this. It's going to cost us too much.
  We're paying today for the neglect, for the consequences of a not-so-
perfect system. Status quo will not cut it, and so we need to go 
forward with progressive policies, with the soundness of reform, with 
the boldness of transition, with the confidence we can instill, with 
the progressiveness of policies that we can draft.
  And so it is a sad note here echoed in this Chamber, that would 
attempt to unravel, dilute, destroy, deny the promise we can make to 
America.
  As I look at this effort for a comeback, the containment of health 
care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control. 
Create that better environment in which to grow jobs, cultivate a 
prosperity. It's important. It's important for us to understand that it 
is part of an economic recovery equation.
  But there's also the wisdom of investing in education, in higher 
education, again, under attack by a system that does not always profess 
the strength of research and education and patents and discovery.
  We understand that we are in the midst of a global race on 
innovation, clean energy and ideas and high tech. To be outstanding 
competitors, to arrive at that race ready to conquer, we will need to 
be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global 
scene.
  We saw that order of passion. We saw that order of investment in the 
global race on space just decades ago. This Nation, impacted by a 
Sputnik moment, dusted off its backside and said, Never again. Never 
again.
  And what was the result?
  Together, a Nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race 
on space. We are going to be that agent, that Nation, that proud people 
that would stake the American flag on the Moon. And we won that race 
because of a commitment, because of investment in the soundness of the 
people of this great country and her business community. We embraced 
research. We embraced science. We believed in our strength as a people, 
and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the 
victory.
  Where is that like passion today? Where is that leadership?
  A rather youthful President that led us in the sixties and challenged 
us, in almost replication today, finds us, interestingly, to be 
challenged by a rather youthful President asking us to enter into the 
global sweepstakes, committing with passion to the cause.
  And so we need that investment in education, in higher education and 
research. Just today, in Schenectady, New York, in the 21st 
Congressional District of New York that I'm proud to represent, we 
announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing 
center at that facility of GE.
  CEO Jeff Immelt traveled for the celebration, came to town to 
announce this wonderful, wonderful addition. That is America at work 
with her genius activity. That's America determined to win the global 
race on ideas.
  Advanced battery manufacturing, the battery, the linchpin to so much 
potential out there, to grow domestic supplies of energy, to grow jobs 
as we grow our energy future, to reduce the gluttonous dependency on 
fossil-based fuels, oftentimes imported from some of the most 
unfriendly nations to the United States, sending hundreds of billions 
of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to 
train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the 
battlefield.

                              {time}  2150

  Unacceptable. There is a better way, and this Congress knows it.
  We invest in jobs. We invest in health care. We invest in education. 
We invest in research. We do it in a way that promises our best attempt 
as a Nation to generations yet unborn. Someone was there for us, and we 
need to be there for future generations of Americans to provide the 
sort of cutting-edge opportunity that will spell America at her best. I 
look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but 
nanotechnology and semiconductor signs, chip manufacturing.
  The newly designed 20th Congressional District in New York that 
comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st District that I 
represent is probably one of the most technology invested-in 
congressional districts in the country. It is happening because there 
is this belief in the worker, a belief in the entrepreneur, a belief in 
the small business community, a belief in the industrial context of the 
district, and knowing full well that America's needs--be they for the 
environment or energy's sake or business creation, job creation, 
business opportunity--are inspiring this remarkable progress.
  It requires our moving forward with a plan. It requires our moving 
forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the 
corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends. I 
see it all the time. I see it in energy-efficiency programs that 
produce jobs, that enable us to capture waste heat. That is part of the 
energy process, enabling us to be much more efficient. Efforts that 
enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown 
much more competitive, much more sophisticated we can ill afford to 
weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international 
economy.
  The old American spirit, the history of this Nation replete with 
those rags to riches scenarios, that became the reason and the 
inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to 
these shores, because the opportunity called the ``American Dream'' 
became the prize for which they searched. I see it in my own roots. The 
proudest label I carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants. Their 
journey gave me great opportunity, and it gave my family great 
opportunity. Those journeys chased after the American Dream.
  We need, beginning in this House Chamber, to reignite the American 
Dream, to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people, to 
reach into that American heart and soul that has

[[Page H4772]]

forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have 
opportunity, and that we will not deny that opportunity, that we will 
strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the 
needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a 
generation of Americans.
  Let us not fail in that attempt. Let us continue to reach deep into 
that American spirit. At a time when we were challenged and our economy 
was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well, 
that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources, and when we 
tripped and fell, let it be known that, in the recovery, we were 
stronger than ever before. Because of that belief that our best days 
lay ahead of us, the belief that those best days were in the future, we 
moved forward, and we dug deep into that American spirit to respond 
with the respect for America's middle class. Our middle class--all of 
us in that middle class--have always understood if you play hard, if 
you abide by the rules, if you roll up your sleeves and do your best, 
you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success.
  That is America in her most shining moments, and that is an economy 
that we can produce. It begins with the soundness of a strong and 
productive workforce that went through training and retraining, that 
got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that 
comes with education, and to then understand our gifts so that we could 
share them in the most profound way, and then to provide for the 
wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive, so that the 
conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of 
respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to 
a Nation that was humbled by its own beginnings, where the rightful 
stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a Nation 
that believed in her people.
  So, tonight, on this eve of an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, let us understand that our budget here in Washington, our actions 
with legislation, our responsiveness to the needs of the American 
people are an establishment of our priorities--a prescription of what 
we see our future to be--a reaching into the heart to say that we are a 
truly caring lot. That's what separates us from other nations. It is 
the uniqueness of America and her greatness. The Affordable Care Act is 
a measurement of not only sound policy; it is a statement of a 
compassionate society that understands it's not about oneself, that 
it's about neighbors, that it's about community, that it's about The 
Great Society.
  It has been the history through the decades, through the vintages of 
time, that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government, 
to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation, to respond to the 
challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us, 
always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger.
  We owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet 
unborn. Let them look at this moment in history, American history, 
knowing that America was challenged, that she stepped up to the plate 
and said ``yes'' to her people and truly made a difference, and allowed 
people to understand full well that the best days of this great Nation 
lie ahead of us.
  With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Affordable Care 
Act. At home in Hawaii we have a saying, ``Lucky you live Hawaii.'' 
That can

[[Page S6552]]

mean a lot of different things to different people, but when talking 
about access to affordable, effective care, this phrase has particular 
meaning.
  In the early 1970s, the rate of uninsured in our State was about 30 
percent, meaning roughly 1 in 3 in our population would live in fear 
that sickness or injury could cause financial ruin for themselves or 
their families. The people of Hawaii knew this was unacceptable.
  In 1974, the State government passed an innovative piece of 
legislation, the Prepaid Health Care Act. Now simply known as Prepaid, 
this legislation requires employers to provide affordable and quality 
care for hundreds of thousands of individuals and their families.
  Our uninsured rate is one of the lowest in the country, with only 8 
percent of our population lacking any type of insurance. Even though 
Hawaii has been at the forefront in making health care a right and not 
a privilege, we still have a way to go. Even with Prepaid, there are 
more than 100,000 people in our State still uninsured.
  When the Affordable Care Act passed 3 years ago, I knew it meant that 
those who are uninsured or underinsured in Hawaii would find some 
relief. We have already seen major successes since this landmark 
legislation passed.
  Yet people are still afraid of ObamaCare. This is because a lot of 
people have spent a lot of time and money to make the American public 
believe that somehow this legislation is bad for them and will harm 
them. That is why, when asked about health care reform as a whole, many 
Americans say they are concerned, they have anxiety. But when you talk 
to people back in Hawaii and across the Nation, and even those who 
think they don't like health care reform, they like what it does.
  For example, parents like that they can keep their children on their 
health insurance until the age of 26, which affects 6,000 young adults 
in the State of Hawaii. People will no longer have to live in fear of 
lifetime limits on health benefits, which will help more than 460,000 
residents of Hawaii, including 115,000 children. More than half a 
million people in my State will no longer have to worry about being 
denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
  As a State that has committed to Medicaid expansion, Hawaii will also 
now be able to provide care to close to more than 68,000 residents 
starting in 2014.
  People like these policies. People like what health care reform is 
already doing for them.
  While my colleagues across the aisle are looking to repeal this 
historic legislation, I am looking forward to how we can build on its 
success.
  Let me be clear. The fact that health care reform is working is 
exactly why the detractors of the ACA are trying so hard to stop it 
from being fully implemented. They know the American people are 
embracing ObamaCare because of all the good it will do for our 
families.
  In particular, I am looking forward to the opening of our 
marketplace, the Hawaii Health Connector, on October 1. Many of the 
people I have spoken to want to know what the marketplace may mean for 
them. Simply, the Hawaii Health Connector is going to provide a 
consumer-friendly way for residents of my State to view and compare a 
wide variety of plans. Then they will be able to pick the coverage that 
best suits them and their families. My office has been in constant 
contact with the Connector, and their staff in Hawaii has been working 
tirelessly to set up the online and phone interface, and to provide 
assistance and navigation in the form of kokua, a word in Hawaiian that 
essentially means pitching in to help your neighbors and your community 
with no regard for personal gain.
  This is reflective of the values we have in Hawaii, that everyone 
deserves to be healthy and have access to affordable and quality care. 
That doesn't mean we still don't have a lot of work to do.
  I am hoping a number of bills I have introduced, including the Rural 
Preventive Health Care Training Act and the Strengthening Health 
Disparities Data Collection Act, will be considered and voted on by the 
full Senate in order to solve some of our worst issues in providing 
care to rural and underserved populations in Hawaii and across the 
Nation.
  I believe ACA is working the way it should be. It is increasing the 
number of insured Americans, promoting preventive care that will help 
to reduce the human and financial costs of avoidable illness and 
lowering the costs of care for everyone.
  Many of my colleagues in Congress choose not to see any of this. The 
only option for them is total repeal, with zero tolerance for open 
discussion or compromise on this landmark legislation, but that kind of 
thinking is what causes the gridlock Americans are so tired of. I 
understand there will be parts of this law, which is a sweeping piece 
of legislation, that will need to be amended over time to resolve any 
kinks. These kinds of revisions have been done with every other 
landmark domestic social policy that has been passed in this country, 
including Medicare and Social Security.
  I am willing, as are my colleagues on the Democratic side, to come to 
the table and work with Republicans to make necessary improvements over 
time, but I refuse to engage in the process of political and 
parliamentary gymnastics designed to score small, short-term wins at 
the expense of the American people and the economy.
  It must be pointed out that anyone who wants to grind the entire 
government to a halt over the implementation of this several-years-old 
law will cause harm to the economy and harm to their communities, 
because Federal funding provides essential services and programs to 
constituents in every State and every county in every district. If 
improvements or changes need to be made, they can be done through the 
regular order with hearings, serious discussions, and bipartisan 
support. Ultimately, what we are seeing in Hawaii and across the Nation 
is President Obama's historic health care package is making inroads in 
improving our health care system. Efforts to stop that cannot be 
tolerated by Members of Congress and the people of this Nation.
  I will continue to support its full implementation and look forward 
to working with all of my colleagues in the Senate to build upon its 
success.
  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. MARKEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business 
for up to 15 minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

GOP DOCTORS CAUCUS: THE EFFECTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON AMERICA'S 
                               HOSPITALS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Buerkle) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Ms. BUERKLE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
  Here in Washington, we are divided on many issues, but whether we are 
a Republican or a Democrat, Members of Congress recognize the essential 
role that our hospitals play in our communities.
  Hospitals provide care for the sick, and the clinics provide 
essential care to many. They are engaged in important medical research, 
and teaching hospitals are educating doctors and nurses to provide care 
for future generations. In many districts across the country, including 
mine, New York's 25th Congressional District, our hospitals are our 
major employers.

[[Page H7812]]

They're perhaps the largest single employer a congressional district 
may have.
  The health care sector constitutes nearly 18 percent of the United 
States' economy, and it is one of the more stable portions of our 
economy. American hospitals employ more than 5.4 million people; and as 
hospitals and hospital employees buy goods and services from other 
businesses, they create additional jobs. The economic impact is felt 
throughout the community. Hospitals are a vital part of our local and 
our national economy. In New York State, particularly in my home 
district, hospitals are the largest single employer.
  I want to call your attention to this chart, Mr. Speaker, with data 
provided by the Hospital Association of New York, which shows the 
importance hospitals have on my district's local economy. Five 
hospitals in my district employ over 18,000 people. Together, payroll 
and purchases in my district alone amount to over $2.4 billion. They 
generate over $100 million in State and local income sales taxes. This 
is in my district alone with regard to the economic impact of our 
hospitals.
  Looking at New York State as a whole--and I hope some of my New York 
colleagues will join me here tonight--the hospitals contribute nearly 
$108 billion to our State and our local economies. Mr. Speaker, it is 
no exaggeration to say hospitals are a mainstay of our New York State 
economy; so when our hospitals are hurting, the effects extend to the 
entire community. Our hospitals are under assault. Not only will it 
affect our local and State economies, but it will also affect access to 
health care, to some of the most basic services that our hospitals 
provide to our communities.
  I now yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady from New York for 
yielding to me.
  Mr. Speaker, as I think most of my colleagues know, Congresswoman 
Buerkle is a member of the House GOP Doctors Caucus. There are 21 of 
us, all health care providers--some doctors, some nurses, some 
dentists, some psychologists. We've got a really good, diverse group 
that has--I would hate to say, Mr. Speaker, the total number of years 
of clinical experience that we all have in the aggregate, but it's 
several hundred. I have thoroughly enjoyed having Congresswoman Buerkle 
as a member of the House GOP Doctors Caucus. She is a Registered Nurse, 
who has worked for years in hospitals in the New York area.
  As she has pointed out, the four hospitals in her district are 
probably, if not the major employer, one of the major employers; and 
it's so important to her community, the 25th District of New York. That 
is so true, Mr. Speaker, across so many of our districts. I happen to 
be an OB/GYN physician, having practiced in my congressional district, 
the 11th of Georgia, for some 26 years.

  In our hospital system there, in the main town in Cobb County, 
Marietta, Georgia, where we have lived for the last 36 years, just as 
in Congresswoman Buerkle's district, the hospital system is one of the 
main drivers of the economy--that and the public school system. The 
hospital systems are employers, and we sometimes forget that.
  I think, as a physician, a lot of times I may be guilty of 
concentrating on issues that mainly affect my colleagues in the medical 
profession--the practitioners, the MDs; yet Congresswoman Buerkle is 
pointing out--and I know she has got a number of posters and slides for 
us to look at tonight--the devastating effects that the so-called 
Affordable Care Act--the unaffordable care act, indeed--has had on our 
hospitals like hers, the four hospitals in the 25th District of New 
York, and on the WellStar Health System and its, I think, six different 
facilities in the metropolitan Atlanta, Cobb County area. It is 
devastating.
  So I really appreciate the opportunity to join with her tonight, 
along with some of my other colleagues in the House GOP Doctors Caucus, 
to make sure that people understand that it's not just the doctors and 
the health providers outside of the hospitals who are suffering because 
of this unaffordable care act, but it's our hospital systems all across 
the Nation.
  I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me, and I plan to be with her 
during this next hour.
  Ms. BUERKLE. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for being here this 
evening.
  Mr. Speaker, as my colleague mentioned, the President's Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, which became law in March of 2010, 
included some welcome provisions, such as allowing people to stay on 
their parents' insurance until the age of 26 and prohibiting insurers 
from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. These positive 
provisions, which proponents quickly point to when facing criticism, 
are far outweighed by the negative consequences that the Affordable 
Care Act has on our providers and the health care system.
  These measures could have been accomplished in a much simpler manner. 
I say to you, Mr. Speaker, so many roads are paved with good 
intentions, but the unintended consequences are devastating to our 
hospitals.
  As a health care professional, my opposition to the Affordable Care 
Act has never been solely based on philosophical grounds, but on 
strategic and tactical ones. Most Americans--myself included and my 
colleagues here in Congress--recognize that health care needs to be 
reformed and that health care costs continue to rise. We need to figure 
this out. We disagree as to what the health care reform should look 
like. If I thought that the Federal Government could be the necessary 
agent of change, that would be one thing; but I don't believe the 
government can change health care.
  The Affordable Care Act affects our hospitals and our providers. This 
is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, but an American one--as 
access to health care affects every American.

                              {time}  2030

  Mr. Speaker, I yield now to the gentleman from Michigan, Dr. 
Benishek.
  Mr. BENISHEK. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.
  Mr. Speaker, I have spent 28 years as a physician practicing rural 
medicine, even serving on the board of my local hospital. I am well 
aware of the great financial difficulties most rural hospitals and 
clinics experience each year.
  Today I was pleased that the State of Michigan celebrated Rural 
Health Day. On behalf of the thousands of Michiganders that call small 
towns and farming communities home, my State's Governor chose to 
recognize the hospitals and community-based centers that provide for 
the diverse and unique health care needs of these areas. Tonight I 
would like to join the State of Michigan in raising awareness about the 
importance these providers bring to the communities that I represent.
  While we recognize the importance of rural health today, I would be 
remiss if I did not mention one of the great rural health facilities in 
my district. Many of my colleagues may have visited the Straits of 
Mackinac during a summer vacation, or perhaps they've seen the Mackinac 
Island featured on a ``Pure Michigan'' ad. The Rural Health Clinic in 
St. Ignace is the single largest employer in the community, supporting 
not only the local township but, in addition, the 900,000-plus seasonal 
visitors that depend upon the hospital for services each year.
  I recently received a distressing letter from Mr. Rodney Nelson, the 
CEO of Mackinac Straits Health System. Mr. Nelson is very worried about 
the impact Medicare cuts may have on his patients, employees, and 
ultimately the ability to keep the doors to the hospital open. Mr. 
Speaker, the Mackinac Straits Health System is one of 25 hospitals in 
my district that is considered either critical access or sole community 
hospital. Of these, 56 percent are already operating in the red.
  Unlike urban areas, my constituents often do not have another option 
when seeking health care. In the case of the St. Ignace Hospital, the 
next closest clinic is 50 miles away. What you may not know, Mr. 
Speaker, is that caring for patients in rural facilities is far more 
economic than providing urban care. In fact, rural patients cost less 
to treat in eight of the nine CMS regions.
  As my colleagues and I discuss possible ways to trim the budget, I 
feel it's important to remember that without rural hospitals, many of 
my constituents would not have access to medical care. A 2 percent 
reduction in Medicare

[[Page H7813]]

spending is estimated to cost 389 jobs in my district as a direct 
result of the cuts to rural hospitals. If this number were raised to 10 
percent, the figures would only get worse. At that point, 76 percent of 
the hospitals would be operating in the red; and the total impact is 
expected to be nearly $68 million, with 1,900 jobs affected. Mr. 
Speaker, I don't need to tell anyone that northern Michigan can't 
afford to lose another 1,900 jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, if we force these cuts, not only will we lose these 
jobs, but we will lose access to many people's sole source of health 
care. We are forcing rural patients to travel longer distances to seek 
more expensive care. This just costs everyone more money.
  I urge my colleagues to exercise caution when considering reductions 
to Medicare programs, especially those specific to physicians, critical 
access, and sole community hospitals.
  Ms. BUERKLE. I thank the gentleman from Michigan.
  Mr. Speaker, we've touched upon it, and I want to continue having 
this conversation about the effect that the Affordable Care Act is 
going to have on our hospitals in our Medicare population. Now, Mr. 
Speaker, you may have heard over and over again from our colleagues 
from the other side of the aisle, demagoguing our budget proposal that 
came out in April. They say we want to kill Medicare; we want to kill 
Social Security; we don't care about our seniors.
  Tonight I stand here, Mr. Speaker, and I tell you, and I want to tell 
the American people, that the Affordable Care Act, in fact, cuts 
Medicare spending by $500 billion. Those are actual cuts that are now 
in the Affordable Care Act, or what is known as the health care law. 
One of the most negative effects is the result of reductions in 
hospital Medicare payments and the CMS code, offsetting reductions to 
hospital payment plans.
  I have a chart here, Mr. Speaker. And as I go through my notes, I 
want it to be clear that you can see 2010 and what happens to Medicare 
reimbursements, down until 2018. Our hospitals can't sustain these 
cuts. The five hospitals in my district have come to me, and they said, 
This Affordable Care Act--and many of these hospitals were big 
proponents of the Affordable Care Act because they know in our country 
we need to reform our health care system, we need to make some changes, 
so they were in support of the law.
  But what they didn't realize was this law is going to cut their 
Medicare reimbursements, which so many of them depend on. It's the 
mainstay--by 28.6 percent. I've had hospitals in my district say to me, 
We cannot sustain these cuts. We will go bankrupt. Because you see, Mr. 
Speaker, it's not only this Medicare, the reduction in these rates, but 
it also is a series of other cuts which we will get into as the evening 
proceeds.
  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me.
  I wanted to take an opportunity, Mr. Speaker. I have an article from 
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atlanta's main newspaper--this was 
several months ago--referencing one of our best hospitals, Piedmont 
Health Care. The title of the article is ``Piedmont Health Care Cutting 
5 Percent of Workforce.'' And this is what Misty Williams of the 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution says in this op-ed piece:
  ``Faced with a rising number of uninsured patients and unknown impact 
of the new health care law''--that would be the so-called Affordable 
Care Act--``Piedmont Health Care announced Thursday evening''--this was 
5 months ago--``plans to cut 464 jobs as part of an effort to save an 
estimated $68 million. Totaling roughly 5 percent of its workforce, the 
cuts include 171 positions that were vacant or altered because of 
scheduling changes. Layoffs are coming from across the board, including 
Piedmont's four hospitals, physician groups, heart institute and 
corporate division, spokeswoman Nina Day said.''
  And I quote Ms. Day: ``This is heart wrenching. This is not easy 
stuff when you're talking about people.''
  ``The move is, in part, a reaction to hurdles''--the hurdles that 
Congresswoman Buerkle and Congressman Benishek were just talking 
about--``to hurdles many hospitals are facing, including a growing 
number of uninsured patients, a new State hospital bed tax, anticipated 
cuts to Medicare reimbursements, and the Medicaid expansion in 2014.''
  The article goes on, talking more and more about how devastating this 
would be. And in conclusion--without reading the entire article--I'll 
finish up and then yield back to my colleague.
  The last paragraph of this article by Ms. Williams: ``While hospitals 
will get more insured patients as a result of the Medicaid expansion in 
2014, it's a big trade-off with Medicare cuts. State officials have 
estimated Georgia''--my State--``could add more than 600,000 enrollees 
to its Medicaid program as a result of this expansion.'' Again, under 
ObamaCare. ``It's a challenge in time just trying to navigate all of 
these changes.''
  Again, it's just so important that we're having the opportunity 
tonight on behalf of our leadership to tell our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle--Congresswoman Buerkle moments ago said, It's not a 
Democrat or a Republican issue. It's a people issue. It's a community 
issue. And it's devastating. And it's sad news that we're bringing to 
our colleagues, but we need to do that. And the American people need to 
understand what's coming. The worst has not yet hit.
  Ms. BUERKLE. I thank the gentleman from Georgia.
  I have spent most of my professional career in the health care 
industry. I have represented a hospital for a number of years, so I 
know up close and personal how these issues have affected and will 
affect our hospitals and our providers. And despite the best intentions 
of this health care law--whether we disagree with it or we agree with 
it--despite the best intentions of this health care law, what we are 
seeing are the unintended consequences.

                              {time}  2040

  The fact that our hospitals, our health care providers, will not be 
able to proceed, will not be able to perform the services that our 
communities need and expect and have come to expect. That certainly 
wasn't the intent of the health care law, but ladies and gentlemen and 
Mr. Speaker, that's exactly what is happening.
  I would like to yield and recognize the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina.
  Mrs. ELLMERS. Thank you, Congresswoman Buerkle, for holding this 
Special Order tonight, along with my colleagues on the Doctors Caucus. 
And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for being here. We are all here because we 
are health professionals. We know the real world of health care, and we 
know the real world solutions. It's the reason I'm here in Washington 
now, that and the fact that I'm concerned about where the future of the 
country is going for our children.
  Many times in our health care practice as a nurse and in my husband's 
surgery practice as small business owners, over time we have always 
looked at these issues, whether we're talking about Medicare, whether 
we're talking about the possibility of having real, good, concrete tort 
reform, all of these different issues that we've said if we could put 
these in place, health care could have a much more solid foundation 
moving forward.
  We already know that we have the best health care in the world. But 
being in the industry, having that small business and understanding 
where Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements--which were down--were 
going, you have to ask yourself, how can this continue? How can we 
provide health care into the future? Well, of course we know that the 
health care bill was passed in the 111th Congress, and now we are 
seeing the effects of it. One of the effects, as you've pointed out, 
are to our hospitals. You know, it's important that we are able to 
articulate this to the American people, connecting the dots.
  When we talk about the importance of why ObamaCare is devastating to 
physicians, it's because it affects their ability to be reimbursed for 
their services. When Medicare will be cut--as we know in ObamaCare, it 
was cut by $500 billion. Today our seniors are saying to us, we're 
worried that you're going to cut our benefits. Well, their benefits 
will not be cut by any of us in Washington. However, because the 
dollars have been taken out in a significant amount, Medicare will have 
to say, I don't know what we'll cover. What are we going to cover?

[[Page H7814]]

  And as we know, again, in the President's health care bill, the 15-
person panel has been put in place. This 15-person panel will decide 
what Medicare will and will not pay for. That will be direct payments 
to hospitals, not just physicians but hospitals, based on the services 
that they're providing. And if they decide that a service cannot be 
paid for, there are penalties that can be assessed.
  There are solutions to this issue, and I pointed out one would be 
significant tort reform. Not only for our physicians, but again for 
hospitals. Why is that important? Sometimes I'm afraid we don't explain 
well enough to the American people why something like malpractice 
reform would help the situation.
  Well, we know that in our Nation's hospitals if you go into the 
emergency room, you're going to receive care whether you can pay for it 
out of pocket or not, whether you have an insurance card or not, 
whether you're on Medicare or Medicaid, it doesn't matter. You're going 
to receive the care. The problem is someone does have to pay for those 
services because services are rendered. You go into the emergency room, 
and many tests are ordered. Physicians order more tests out of pure 
fear for missing something. You can't go into an emergency room and get 
the good care that you need to get if you cannot identify the problem. 
So as we know, physicians and hospitals, physicians and doctor's 
offices, tend to cover all their bases rather than simply relying on 
the medical education that they have received, the ability to diagnose 
with just that--with the ability of their practice.
  So here we are. We talk about health care costs every day, and the 
escalating cost of them. A good contributor to that is another piece of 
the President's health care bill which basically puts a tax on all 
medical devices. Well, think about the cost for any hospital, any 
provider. What do we do in hospitals? We do surgery. We provide health 
care. These are medical devices. These are instruments that have made 
our lives better and help us live longer, but yet now they will be 
taxed. This is a tax that will have to be assessed. Someone will have 
to pay for it. If the effort is truly to decrease the cost of health 
care, how can we continue by increasing the cost? It doesn't make 
sense. It doesn't add up.
  So again, the importance is for us to connect the dots for the 
American people; to show that if we are able to pull back on ObamaCare, 
that we are able to remove it, repeal it, as we have already voted here 
in the House, then we can make the significant changes.
  There is one more point that I would like to touch on, and it has to 
do with the ability to pay for services. There was a consulting firm, 
Mercer Consulting Company, and they did a study that shows that 9 
percent of employers with 500 or more workers say they are likely to 
cancel health benefits in 2014 after State-run health insurance 
exchanges begin offering coverage under the health care law. There 
again, once again, it will become the government paying for it, which 
is paid for by the American taxpayers' dollars. We simply cannot 
continue on this path with health care or any other issue. It has to 
come with free-market solutions, and we have those solutions and we are 
ready to put those in place.
  I just, again, want to reassure our seniors who are receiving 
Medicare now or in the near future that we are doing everything we can 
to rescue Medicare from the President's health care bill and put those 
necessary pieces in place so that we can continue those services into 
the future that they have paid for their entire lives.
  I again thank my colleague from New York for holding this Special 
Order.
  Ms. BUERKLE. And I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for being 
here this evening.
  I would just like to continue on because of my concern, and I know my 
colleagues have such concerns, about the health and the well-being of 
their hospitals. As I mentioned earlier, they are the largest employer 
in my district. We refer to it as ``eds and meds.'' We have a large 
university there and some colleges, but we also have five hospitals in 
my district. So our reliance for our local economy and for our State 
economy is just so very important.
  I want to talk a little more about what this health care law is going 
to do to Medicare and do to our hospitals. There is $112 billion in 
reduced market basket updates to hospitals. There is a $36 billion 
reduction to Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital 
payments.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, disproportionate share may sound a little 
confusing. I'm going to explain what that is. In a district such as 
mine, we have hospitals that have missions. And I'm sure across the 
country, many hospitals have missions. They want to make sure that the 
indigent population, folks who can't afford insurance, who are self-
pays or maybe are on Medicaid, that they have access to quality 
services. So the government says to these hospitals, we understand that 
Medicaid reimbursements or self-pay patients will not cover your 
services. So what we're going to do is, we're going to try to make you 
whole with this disproportionate share. Mr. Speaker, the health care 
law eliminates the disproportionate share for hospitals, and so 
hospitals that have a high indigent population or a high number of 
self-pay patients or those who are on Medicaid, they are not going to 
get that disproportionate share.
  The hospital in my district came down here. It is a large teaching 
institution. They made a special trip down here to tell me that 
provision of the health care law will bankrupt them. They probably 
receive somewhere around $80 million a year to make them whole because 
of their mission. And isn't that what we want? We want to make sure--
and wasn't that the original intent of the health care law?--to make 
sure that there was accessible care for all Americans. But here again 
we reached the unintended consequences, and the effect that this law is 
going to have on our hospitals.

                              {time}  2050

  There is a $7.1 billion reduction for readmissions. We will talk 
about that in a little bit.
  Hospitals, and many of the ones in my district, and I know throughout 
this country, they are heavily dependent on Medicare and Medicaid 
dollars. And with that narrow margin, Medicare and Medicaid don't even 
cover their costs. And so there's such a small margin for them to 
operate that there's really little capacity for improvements. 
Realistically, hospitals--especially teaching hospitals and hospitals 
that are treating the underserved--cannot bridge that gap, and they 
won't be able to bridge that gap because of this new health care law.
  Hospitals must be able to invest in their infrastructure. Having such 
a narrow margin and/or no margin operating in the red, they're not 
going to be able to do that. They're not going to be able to invest in 
infrastructure, systems improvements, new techniques to reduce 
hospital-acquired infections, new models of delivering health care and 
electronic health records.
  And I want to talk about electronic health records because they were 
mandated in the health care law. The Affordable Care Act mandates that 
hospitals must move to electronic health records. Now, from a patient 
safety standpoint, that's a good thing, but getting hospitals up to 
speed and getting them ready for business has very high IT costs for 
our hospitals. So, again, you've got this health care law mandating 
electronic records, and you've got these drastic cuts to our hospitals 
in their Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements.
  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding once again.
  Just a few minutes ago, one of our colleagues spoke also about this 
problem with hospitals, Representative Ellmers from North Carolina, who 
knows of what she speaks. She works in an office with her husband, a 
general surgeon. They see patients every day in the office, but they 
also have a largely hospital-based practice because it's surgery and 
you just don't do that in the office. But she had listed some of the 
things in ObamaCare, in this so-called Affordable Care Act, Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, when it was passed a year 
and a half ago.
  We all realized that this was a new entitlement program, Mr. Speaker, 
and the American people need to understand that it's not about 
strengthening

[[Page H7815]]

and saving Medicare for our seniors. That entitlement program is 
struggling mightily. And as Representative Buerkle mentioned, to take 
$500-plus billion out of that program to pay for a whole new 
entitlement program, ObamaCare, for in many cases the young and 
healthy, and also to put some of the burden of paying for that new 
entitlement program on the Medicaid program, the safety net program for 
the poor, it only weakens that program. So you literally gut Medicaid 
for the poor and the disabled and Medicare for our senior citizens, 
when both programs need strengthening and saving, not gutting.
  It was this whole idea of having Medicare for all, really, or 
national health care, there are all kinds of euphemisms to describe 
this, especially, not the least of which is the name of it, the 
Affordable Care Act. And as I said earlier, Mr. Speaker, and I know my 
colleague from New York would agree with this, it is the unaffordable 
care act. And both she and Representative Ellmers from North Carolina 
said, look, we know on both sides of the aisle that health care in this 
country is too expensive, and we need to go about changes that will 
lower the cost and not hurt the quality. And we can do that.
  President Obama keeps denying that there are any ideas and certainly 
didn't listen to the physicians in this body or the health care 
providers or physicians and the nurses that said, look, let us come 
over and sit down and talk with you or any of your folks in the 
Executive Office of the Presidency and let us explain, because we 
have--and I said it earlier--several hundred years of clinical 
experience. We do have some ideas, and we really believe we want to be 
part of the solution and not part of the problem.
  But my colleague who is leading the hour and doing such a great job 
of it, I know she will agree that I haven't been called, I haven't been 
invited over. I will ask my colleague and yield back to her and ask her 
the same question. And I know what the answer will be.
  Again, the important thing for our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to 
understand, is that the creation of this new program, this new 
entitlement program so that everybody can get health care, whether they 
want to buy health insurance or not, is so detrimental to Medicare and 
Medicaid that I fear for the future of those programs. I really, really 
do.
  That's what it's all about here tonight, to take an opportunity to 
explain so people really understand the ultimate consequences of this.
  Ms. BUERKLE. I thank the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to just emphasize again with regards to this 
health care law and the fact that this law--and, Mr. Speaker, this is a 
law, this isn't a budget proposal, this is a law--guts Medicare by $500 
billion. It should be of concern, Mr. Speaker, to our seniors because 
this law, in fact in 2014, will begin to gut Medicare. I again would 
look at this chart and the Medicare reimbursements. There will be no 
hospitals that will be able to provide health care. If you look at what 
the trend is for Medicare reimbursements to our hospitals, they cannot 
continue to exist based on what is set forth in the Affordable Care 
Act.
  I spoke with the CEO of one of our local hospitals, Crouse Hospital 
in Syracuse, and he spoke with one of my health care staff; and he 
indicated to us today that Crouse Hospital, one hospital in the 
district, is facing a projected loss of $18 million in reimbursement 
reductions. That number goes to access to care. We can have the most 
comprehensive health care law on the books, but if we don't have 
hospitals who are able to provide that care, and we don't have 
physicians who are able to provide that care, we will have access-to-
health-care problems.
  Mr. Speaker, earlier I talked about hospital readmission penalties. 
This is another concern hospitals have to deal with. And tonight we've 
talked a lot about what the Affordable Care Act will do to hospitals, 
the effect that it will have on our hospitals, the drastic cuts in 
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and the disproportionate share 
being eliminated.
  But our hospitals are under assault from all sides, and that's part 
of the difficulty. Maybe they could somehow figure out how to deal with 
these cuts in the Affordable Care Act; but taken in its totality, our 
hospitals are having a very difficult time. In fact, as I mentioned 
earlier, many are concerned that they will be unable to sustain and 
unable to continue on with their services, given the whole assaults 
that are coming from all directions.
  And this actually is part of the Affordable Care Act. It establishes 
a punitive policy for our hospitals when they readmit a patient. And I 
will explain that, Mr. Speaker. Under the health care law, the 
Affordable Care Act--we call it the Affordable Care Act, we call it 
ObamaCare, we call it many things--but under this new law that is 
taking effect gradually, under this to their expected readmission 
rates, if even more than one readmission occurs--and that readmission 
means that you discharge a patient, the hospital sends a patient home 
and then for some reason they have to come back. If that happens with 
one of three diagnoses within the Medicare scheme, the hospital will be 
penalized for all of the Medicare reimbursements, not just th.."

                    AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE

  (Mr. ROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, recently, I received an email from a woman in 
my district named Shannon. Shannon received a letter from her health 
care provider stating that her current health care policy did not meet 
the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and that she would have to 
choose a new plan or go to the health care marketplace and find 
coverage.
  She went to the health care marketplace and found a comparable plan 
that cost $400 a month more. This is outrageous. More than 300,000 
Floridians, like Shannon, received letters that their current health 
care plans were canceled. Premiums and deductibles are increasing for 
countless Americans. So many people received notices that their plans 
were canceled. We have only begun to experience the devastating effects 
of this law.
  I submit that the next concern of my constituents will be not only 
that they can't keep their health care plan, but they won't be able to 
keep their doctors. We need to get rid of this law, and we need to 
replace it with one that is consumer-focused and market-driven so that 
Americans like Shannon can get affordable health care coverage and keep 
their doctors.

                         AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Payne) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, for millions of Americans, the dream of 
access to affordable health care is becoming a reality, thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act.
  In New Jersey, 2.2 million people have already gained access to free 
preventative care. Premiums will be 20 percent lower in 2014. Seniors 
on Medicare already received a 50 percent savings on prescription 
drugs, and more than 70,000 young adults in New Jersey are able to see 
a doctor because they can stay on their parents' insurance.
  Sadly, though, out of purely selfish political motivation, my 
Republican colleagues are obsessed with making this law fail and are 
working overtime to take away the benefits millions of people are 
already enjoying. I challenge my Republican colleagues to channel that 
same energy into making the law work so that millions can get the 
lifesaving care that they deserve.
  Look around your districts. How many of your constituents could 
benefit from access to lifesaving health care, to free cancer 
screenings and reduced prescription drug costs? They don't need a 47th, 
48th, or 49th vote to repeal the law. They need the affordable, quality 
care that the ACA provides. And they are counting on their leaders to 
make it work, not to work against them to make it fail.

                MOVING FORWARD ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act began delivering 
important benefits and protections to millions of American families and 
small businesses almost immediately after it was signed into law 3 
years ago.
  Just yesterday, we learned that the cost of health plans in New York 
are set to drop 50 percent. And starting in 2014, California's small 
businesses will be able to access competitive, affordable, quality 
health plans on the Covered California Small Business Exchange, finally 
putting them on more equal footing with the rates that have been 
enjoyed by the big guys.
  And last week, I invited the Small Business Administration to come to 
my district and meet with my local small businesses. They walked them 
through key pieces of the law so they could understand the facts and be 
able to make good decisions about health insurance for their employees. 
Many were pleasantly surprised.
  We need to move forward on affordable health care for Americans, not 
backwards.

                   IMPACTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LaMALFA Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some of the stories 
that fellow Californians in my district are having with the impact 
under the ACA, the ObamaCare plan.
  A funny thing happened on the way to government-run health care 
nirvana. 1.1 million Californians have lost their health care coverage. 
In fact, for every one person who has selected a new ACA ObamaCare 
plan, 40 people have received cancellation notices. They find that 
their costs are going to increase, especially in rural California, 
where choices are more limited of plans, of places to seek health care. 
Their access to health care is being jeopardized. The law is creating a 
huge burden for rural health care, where, again, you have to travel 
maybe several hours, many miles, to seek the kind of health care you 
need.
  Despite the President's promise to the public on this issue, ``If you 
like your plan, you can keep it. Period,'' we heard; ``If you like your 
doctor, you can keep your doctor. Period,'' we heard, this is clearly 
not the case. Less access, fewer choices, skyrocketing premiums, it is 
the wrong direction from the President's health care plan as promised.
  I would like to share, again, some of the people from our district.
  Bill and Corina Eiler from Fort Jones, California, they write, I 
received a letter from Anthem Blue Cross notifying me that, due to the 
Affordable Care Act, my plan had been canceled. My new monthly premium 
of $919, it used to be $480 a month, a 192 percent increase, which Bill 
finds absurd. They have two daughters in college and one more at home. 
How are they supposed to come up with that kind of money?
  Tricia Plass of Tulelake writes that she and her husband, they are 
business owners. They are self-employed. They have always purchased 
their own health insurance. Their monthly premium has been around $800 
a month for both of them. Their monthly premium will now jump to over 
$1,000 for just one of them. They still have to determine what the 
other one is going to do. It now appears they will be forced into 
California's insurance coverage, known as Covered California, where 
there are no plans with coverage for their doctor that they use now. 
Since they live near the State line of Oregon, they get their health 
care on the other side in Oregon. Their facility is there. Their doctor 
is there. They will no longer be able to see that doctor. They are 
going to have to drive maybe 2 or 3 hours to Redding or somewhere else 
to find new physicians. So they live with the constant fear that their 
new policy will not even provide coverage when they need it.
  Janice Marquis from Redding writes:

       I recently received a letter from Aetna stating that my 
     medical care coverage policy would be canceled at the end of 
     the year.

  She is 62 and must wait 2\1/2\ years before she is eligible for 
Medicare. Her insurance coverage will jump from $318 a month to over 
$500 a month. The promise made by President Obama, ``if you like your 
policy, you can keep it,'' she feels, was a lie.

       This entire program is a nightmare.

  Lastly, this one is really disturbing. A lady named Ramona Larramendy 
from Redding, California, says she was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian 
cancer in July. With her current plan she was able to get the surgery 
and treatment she needed. A very large hospital bill of $128,000 was 
covered. Her insurance paid all but $700 of that because she had good 
coverage. Now, because she is going to be canceled, she doesn't know 
what is going to happen to her. She still needs a lot more treatment in 
this crisis moment of her life, and yet, for her Christmas present, she 
is going to get uncertainty. She is going to get the worry, at a time 
where she is being treated for stage 3 cancer, what is the health care 
plan that, for political purposes, it appears, since we have done 
everything else to try and point out to the American people and to the 
politicians in this building that it needs to be fixed or changed, that 
we are not getting it right here.
  So what are we going to do? Again, these Californians are not alone. 
These Americans are not alone. Millions are paying the price for the 
President's broken promises.
  It should not be a political issue. It should be us serving the 
public. We cannot continue to stand by and watch as millions are losing 
their coverage that they want, that they shopped for, that they were 
diligent about, with people that are professionals that know what they 
are doing, unlike what we see with the people running the Web sites, 
which is only a small part of the whole big picture of what is wrong 
with this system.
  We need to set the egos aside, go back to the drawing board--at the 
very least, set this aside for a year. I believe we should repeal it 
and go back to targeting the people that really do need the help and 
let the folks in this country that are already reasonably happy with 
their plan, have done the diligence, have made the efforts to get the 
coverage and be responsible Americans, they don't need to be bothered 
in this scenario. Let's help the people that need the help. The 
American Health Care Reform Act, as put over by the Republican Study 
Committee, is one way to do that.
  So let's look for alternatives. We have alternatives. We have had 
them all along, as Republicans, as conservatives, as people that 
understand business. And so let's make these choices available to the 
American public, not force them into something that they never asked 
for other than for political purposes.

           CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, well, today is a historic day in our 
country. Despite a Republican-led government shutdown that was 
completely unnecessary, we are celebrating the opening of the 
Affordable Care Act or, as I affectionately call it, ObamaCare.
  You know, after almost 100 years of fighting to expand universal 
access to health insurance coverage in the United States of America, in 
2010, Congress finally passed, the President signed, and the Supreme 
Court upheld ObamaCare as the law of the land. And starting today, 
Americans will be able to learn about the health plan choices and the 
financial assistance that is going to be available to them. An army of 
in-person assisters have been trained and stand ready to help Americans 
understand their options and enroll in coverage that best meets their 
needs.
  Americans can go to healthcare.gov, or in Illinois, where I'm from, 
getcoveredillinois.gov is up and running.
  Now I have heard from colleagues on the other side, all these scare 
things about how terrible ObamaCare is going to be for the country and 
for individuals. Let me read to you some constituent letters that I 
have received.
  This is from Gayle Weiss. She says:

       I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1997 and have 
     consistently been denied affordable insurance since that 
     time.
       I am so excited that our President has taken steps to help 
     all Americans with access to health care. It's so fitting 
     that tomorrow is my 59th birthday, and what a fantastic 
     birthday gift. Finally, I won't have to worry about losing 
     everything I've worked so hard for if, God forbid, I suffer a 
     catastrophic health issue. No one should have to risk their 
     future for something they have no control over, like illness.

  I heard from David Zoltan. He is 34 years old. This is what he 
writes:

       One week before Lehman Brothers went under, I was laid off 
     from my job at the time and spent the next 2 years without 
     health insurance. As a diabetic, the scariest thing in the 
     world is to go without health insurance. Insulin averages 
     around $100 to $120 per bottle, and I need approximately 
     three bottles each of two kinds of insulin every month to 
     live. I had to rely on my doctors to help me apply for any 
     charity care program we could find or beg for the very 
     medicines I needed to survive on a daily basis. Even so, I 
     had to visit the hospital emergency room several times just 
     to get insulin when my doctors couldn't get me free 
     medication.
       ObamaCare gave me the preexisting condition plan pools as a 
     lifeline until better solutions were available.
       ObamaCare has done so much for me, and I'm proud today to 
     see the beginning of the largest expansion of health care in 
     my lifetime. There will be problems to fix, but we are 
     America. We will fix these problems. We will give the 
     precious necessity of health security to our citizens. We 
     will prevail.

  And then I also heard from Eva Strobeck. She said:

       I used to get insurance from my husband, who retires in 
     January. I am one of those people for whom it is impossible 
     to get insurance independently. I have three illnesses. 
     ObamaCare makes it possible to get insurance at an affordable 
     rate, which I cannot do without. My psychological medications 
     alone cost about $5,000 per month. I can't survive without 
     ObamaCare. It must be funded by Congress.

  So I want to say that this effort to defund something that will bring 
lifesaving health care to millions of Americans, about 30 million 
Americans who either have to go bankrupt, who have to pay exorbitant 
prices, or simply have to do without health insurance, who would be 
against that? Are there going to be glitches in the program? Of course 
there are.
  Medicare part D had news article after news article talking about the 
problems of this health benefit for the elderly. Let's get on with it 
and provide health care for all Americans starting today.

                          ____________________

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, we now are in about the sixth month of the 
implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We have over 11 million 
people who have received health care--who previously had not been able 
to receive it--either through the private exchanges, which have signed 
up 4 million people all across the country; through the expansion of 
Medicaid, which has reached millions more; or through all of the young 
people who are able to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26 
years old.
  Taxpayers are saving money. In fact, CBO has redone their estimates 
for the 10-year period after the passage of the Affordable Care Act to 
suggest that we are now going to save $1.2 trillion on Federal health 
care spending, in large part because of the reforms in the Affordable 
Care Act.
  Across this country millions of Americans who had been kept out of 
the ranks of the insured because of a preexisting condition now have 
access to health care, and tens of millions of seniors are paying less 
for their health care because they get checkups for free and they are 
able to access prescription drugs for 50 percent or less than the 
original cost when they reach that doughnut hole. So the Affordable 
Care Act is changing lives.
  When you reorder one-sixth of the American economy, there are going 
to be bumps along the road. No one should come to the floor--even those 
of us who are the most vocal proponents of the law--and suggest there 
are not going to be some people who are not going to have the perfect 
experience. Of course there is no excuse for the way in which the Web 
site operated for the first several months. But it is time for 
proponents of this law to tell the real story, and the real story is 
that the Affordable Care Act is working. It is working for millions of 
Americans who now have access to health care. It is working for 
taxpayers who are spending less than ever before as you look at annual 
rates of growth in Federal health care spending.
  Today and this week my colleagues and I are focusing on the benefits 
for one specific group of patients, one specific set of families all 
across this country, and those are patients and families dealing with 
cancer diagnoses.
  So I will start this off--I will be joined later by Senator Stabenow 
and some of my other colleagues--and I want to talk first about a 
family in Indiana. I will talk about some families in Connecticut as 
well, but the Treinens have a story that is, frankly, not unique. They 
had insurance and they thought they had really good insurance. They 
didn't pay too much attention to the lifetime cap of $1 million that 
was in their insurance policy because they just figured, as a 
relatively healthy family, there was no way they were ever going to 
spend $1 million on health care over the course of their time on that 
insurance plan.
  But as millions of families across this country know, cancer can 
interrupt your plans, and that is what happened to the Treinens. Their 
doctors diagnosed their teenage son Michael in 2007 with an aggressive 
form of leukemia. The treatment called for ten doses of chemotherapy 
that cost $10,000 per dose. A 56-day stay in an Intensive Care Unit 
alone cost about $400,000. So Michael and his family reached that $1 
million lifetime maximum in less than 1 year, and it was then left to 
this brave family to go out and raise money in solicitations in their 
neighborhood, in their community and all across the country, which 
miraculously allowed them to bring in $865,000 in 6 days to keep their 
son's treatment going.
  Needless to say, that avenue is not available to every family. But 
due to their ingenuity and their passion, the Treinens were able to 
raise almost $1 million from private donors in order to keep their 
son's treatment going. But the story doesn't end well, however, for the 
Treinens. Even though money came in from all over the United States, 
and as far away as places such as Germany, Michael's cancer eventually 
stopped responding to chemotherapy and he died May 25, before he could 
receive the transplant they all hoped would save his life.
  The reality is that insurance companies have been getting away with 
this practice for years--lifetime or annual limits that for 105 million 
Americans were preventing them from receiving care when they really got 
sick. That is what insurance really is supposed to be for. For those of 
us who buy insurance, we get it in the hopes that should we get very 
sick, that insurance plan will be there to help us. But with annual and 
lifetime limits, when people got really sick, especially with cancer 
diagnoses, that help wasn't there.
  Tom Bocaccio, who is a retired police officer in Newington, CT, is 
still dealing with the consequences of lifetime caps. His wife past 
away after an 8-year struggle with adrenal cancer. After her death, the 
husband she left behind was saddled with a $1.5 million bill because 
the Bocaccios, over that 8-year period of fighting cancer, had exceeded 
their lifetime cap. That changes Tom's life in a myriad of ways. He has 
lost his wife, and there is no way to describe the pain that comes with 
that, especially after that brave, courageous battle of almost a 
decade, but now his entire life is upended by the fact that he has a 
$1.5 million bill he has to pay, and he doesn't have the resources to 
do that.
  So first and foremost, for cancer patients all across this country, 
105 million Americans no longer face lifetime limits on health care 
benefits. For cancer patients, not only does that deliver financial 
security, but it delivers mental and psychological security as well--to 
know in the midst of dealing with this diagnosis and all the pain that 
comes with confronting this disease head on, they do not also have to 
worry about skimping on treatments, about cutting back on hospital 
stays that might harm the recovery or treatment of the patient simply 
because they are trying not to get above that annual or lifetime limit.
  The benefits to cancer patients extend beyond just that protection on 
lifetime and annual limits. In addition, cancer patients are going to 
be able to keep their health care because of the ban on discrimination 
against families and individuals with preexisting conditions.
  I have spoken about the Berger family many times on this floor. They 
are a family that explains exactly why we need this protection. The 
Bergers, from Meriden, CT, had a son who was diagnosed with cancer 
during the 2-week period in which the husband, through which the family 
had insurance, didn't have a job. He switched jobs, and during that 2-
week period in which he was waiting to get insurance through his new 
job, their son was diagnosed with cancer. The new insurance policy 
decided it was a preexisting condition. The Bergers had to pay every 
dime of that treatment and they lost everything. They lost their 
savings, their home. Their lives were transformed because of the 
misfortune of having a cancer diagnosis at the wrong time.

  No family anywhere in the country dealing with a cancer diagnosis 
will ever have to go through what the Bergers went through because here 
ever after the law of this land says that if you have a preexisting 
condition, you cannot be discriminated against.
  There are all sorts of other benefits that matter, whether it be the 
fact you don't have to pay for preventive health care any longer so you 
can get a checkup without cost or clinical trials are now covered which 
many cancer patients enjoy the benefit of. Life changed for cancer 
patients and families dealing with cancer when the Affordable Care Act 
passed.
  Senator Stabenow, myself, and others had a press conference earlier 
this week in which we heard the story of David Weis, a senior at 
Georgetown University who was diagnosed days before his 19th birthday 
with thyroid lymphatic cancer. David talks about the difference the 
Affordable Care Act makes for him, not only in financial terms but in 
terms of how he thinks about his future. David now can go out and get a 
job, search for and pursue a career based on what he wants to do with 
his life rather than based on what job will provide him with adequate 
benefits to treat his cancer should it reoccur.
  I have a constituent who talks about it the same way. He was 14 when 
he was diagnosed with a form of leukemia. He went through treatment for 
over 3 years. His family now knows that with the Affordable Care Act--
because he is only covered on his mom's policy until he is 26--after he 
ages out of his mom's plan, he will be able to pursue his dreams no 
matter what kind of insurance plan his prospective employer has.

[[Page S1354]]

  What we have learned over the years is there is a connection between 
the mind and the body. If you are stressed out about things such as how 
you are going to pay for treatment of your disease, it does have an 
effect on your body's ability to fight that disease. Unfortunately, for 
millions of families dealing with cancer, their treatment has been 
restrained, their body's recovery has been curtailed because they are 
obsessively--and appropriately--always worried about what will happen 
if their insurance runs out.
  The ACA says never again. No family will have to worry because that 
will be guaranteed, and discriminatory policies of annual and lifetime 
limits disappear.
  I will end with the notion that it is important to remember every 
time our Republican friends come down to the floor and talk about how 
awful they believe the Affordable Care Act is, their proposal is to 
return cancer patients and families dealing with cancer back to the 
reality in which they had lifetime limits which ended their coverage--
for this family I talked about from Indiana, after only several 
months--and they want to go back to the days in which families such as 
the Bergers lose everything, their savings, their home, because of a 
mistimed cancer diagnosis.
  This week the House of Representatives voted for the 50th time to 
repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act. I was a Member of that 
body for 6 years, and I probably participated in about 40 of those 
votes. Despite the fact I heard lots of my Republican friends come down 
to the floor and say: We are voting to repeal and replace, they never 
voted once to replace the Affordable Care Act because their agenda is 
not to replace it. Their agenda is simply to repeal it and go back to 
the days in which cancer patients were treated with this kind of 
carelessness.
  Our colleagues on the Democratic side who voted for the Affordable 
Care Act understand there are places where it can be better. We 
understand there is a process of perfecting it. But we understand--
because of families such as the Barrows, because of families such as 
the Weises, the Treinens, and the Bergers--for cancer patients and the 
families who love them, they know the ACA is working, and they know 
they never want to go back to the days in which their lives were put in 
jeopardy by a health care system which didn't work for them.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.
  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from 
Connecticut for his passion and his wonderful advocacy for people who 
just want to know they have health care for themselves and their 
families, which is pretty basic. I thank Senator Murphy for his 
vigilance, for speaking out and being here and talking about what is at 
stake.
  There is an ad on TV which says something like: New car, $30,000; new 
house, $150,000; peace of mind, priceless. What we are talking about in 
terms of access to affordable health care, getting what you are paying 
for, knowing you can't get dropped just because you get sick, knowing 
your child with juvenile diabetes can get care even though it would be 
viewed as a preexisting condition, is peace of mind.
  I can't imagine how scary it must be to sit in a doctor's office and 
have a doctor come in and say: You have cancer. You have leukemia. You 
have breast cancer. This is happening to people every single day, and 
there are many thoughts going through their minds at that time. At some 
point they will turn to the doctor and want to talk about: What kind of 
treatment do I need? Is it going to be covered? How do I get it? What 
is going to happen?
  One in every eight women in America will develop invasive breast 
cancer during their lives. It is not a statistic. These are real women, 
such as my sister-in-law, such as many other people I know. They are 
our daughters, our sisters, our mothers. Men as well are being given 
diagnoses of breast cancer--our friends. They now have the peace of 
mind of knowing they are going to be able to get the care they need at 
an affordable price and they can't be dropped. There is no cap on how 
long they are going to be able to get treatment, and that is priceless.
  I will share a true story about a cancer survivor whose life has been 
changed thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Her name is Chris G.
  Chris found a lump in her breast. Every woman can imagine the 
thoughts which must have gone through Chris's mind. The fear must have 
been unimaginable. It was even worse for Chris because her husband lost 
his job and they didn't have insurance--the worst of all possible 
situations. Because she didn't have insurance, she couldn't see a 
doctor to get the tests she needed. Chris didn't ignore her lump. You 
can't ignore something like that. It is on your mind every single 
minute of every single day. But at that moment she didn't feel she 
could do anything about it because without insurance, if Chris went to 
a doctor, her breast cancer of course would count as a preexisting 
condition and then she would never be able to get insurance.
  But now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Chris and millions of 
women like her can get the affordable insurance they need, and 
marketplaces where insurance companies now have to compete for her 
business give their best price for her business. These are good 
policies which cover treatment women need to beat cancer and survive. 
But before the Affordable Care Act, cancer would haunt these women for 
the rest of their lives as insurance companies labeled their survival a 
preexisting condition--no more.
  Thanks to the ACA, millions of cancer survivors similar to Chris have 
peace of mind--priceless. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions 
of women have access to mammograms and other preventive services. 
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of women similar to Chris 
will never have to worry about annual or lifetime limits on their 
coverage, not being told: OK, cancer. You have eight visits. That is 
it. I hope it works. That is it. No more.
  In fact, the ACA flips that around. It says cancer patients such as 
Chris will never be asked to spend more than a set amount of money in 
total on their treatment. Once they hit that number, the insurance 
company has to pick up the rest of the cost of the treatments. For 
women fighting cancer, this law is a lifesaver.
  There are 7,000 women in my State of Michigan alone who will be newly 
diagnosed with breast cancer this year. This is why it is so important 
for women to get covered, to sign up before March 31, so they can have 
the health care they need this year. This is literally a lifesaving day 
on March 31.
  Once you are covered, you get no-cost preventive services. So you can 
go in, get the checkup, get the mammogram, get other cancer screenings, 
and not have out-of-pocket costs. You get again the peace of mind of 
knowing you are not going to go broke because of health care. Even if 
you get diagnosed with cancer, it is not: Do I get the treatments I 
need for breast cancer or do I have a home for my family? Do I go 
bankrupt or do I try to survive through treatments? Those are not the 
choices available to women and families anymore, and there is access to 
your doctor instead of using the emergency room.
  One of the fallacies of health care reform is this idea of somehow we 
ignore when people get sick and somehow we don't pay for it. Yet we all 
know people who don't have insurance use emergency rooms. I think it is 
interesting to note there is a proposal, in Georgia, where the Governor 
has said: The way to fix the problem with emergency rooms is to say you 
don't have to treat people. That is one way to do it, to say we are not 
going to treat people who are sick, who are in a car accident or have a 
heart attack.
  The other way is through the Affordable Care Act, where we say: 
Instead of people using emergency rooms without insurance and then 
shifting all the costs onto everybody with insurance--which is what 
happens now--we pay for it. We all pay for it. Instead of that 
happening, we will set up a way for people to take personal 
responsibility for their health care and create a way to make it as 
affordable and competitive as possible. Then people will be able to go 
to their doctor instead of the emergency room and be able to get the 
treatment they need on an ongoing basis.
  As women such as Chris can attest, cancer sneaks up on you. You can't 
predict it. You can't avoid it. This is not one of those events where 
you can

[[Page S1355]]

say just buck it up and don't get cancer. We don't want those costs, so 
just don't get sick.
  We all know how ridiculous that is. Yet in some ways this is sort of 
what we keep hearing in some fashion.
  The reality is you can't predict it. You can't avoid it. The only 
thing you can do is survive it, which millions of women are now doing 
who have access to the treatments and health care they need. This is 
why this new health care reform law is so important.
  It is two things. It is health insurance reform, making sure those of 
us who have insurance are getting what we are paying for--as we have 
said before, can't get dropped, don't put artificial limits on the 
number of treatments. So it is insurance reform, so you are getting 
what you are paying for--what you thought you were paying for. It is 
also creating a way for more affordable insurance by creating a 
marketplace where insurance companies then have to bid for your 
business and provide you the best bed possible. We have competition to 
bring the costs down. I know for Chris, I know for women in my own 
family, and I know for people across Michigan, the peace of mind that 
comes with that is, in fact, priceless.

  The debate on the other side is about taking that all away--not 
making it better, not fixing it. Medicare over the year has been 
improved. Medicaid has been improved. Social Security has been 
improved. Everything that is worth doing gets started and then has to 
be worked on to get improved. We are committed to doing that. But there 
are 50 votes now happening in the House to take it all away and to go 
back to saying good luck. If you are a woman, good luck. By the way, 
being a woman is probably viewed as being a preexisting condition. 
Trying to find insurance? Good luck. Good luck trying to get what you 
need from the insurance companies. Peace of mind is worth fighting for, 
and that is what the Affordable Care Act is all about.
  I yield the floor.

                   Savannah Harbor Expansion Project

  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss promises made 
and promises broken, of hypocrisy and politics, of the difference 
between the photo op speeches, press releases, and real action.
  Let me start at the beginning, for those who are just joining us in 
this decade-and-a-half battle. The Panama Canal is about halfway 
through a $5.25 billion expansion which will accommodate the larger 
post-Panamax vessels that are too large to transit the current Panama 
Canal. These new post-Panamax ships are the length of aircraft 
carriers. From the waterline they are 190 feet tall, or nearly twice 
the height of the Lincoln Memorial. The ships can carry as many as 
12,000 containers, or translated into TVs, a million flat screen TVs.
  Thus, the United States must be prepared to accept these larger 
vessels by 2015, when the Panama Canal expansion is complete. The Port 
of Savannah in Savannah, Georgia, is the second busiest U.S. container 
exporter, handling 13.2 million tons in exports in 2012 alone. It is 
the busiest port on the East Coast. In order to accommodate the new 
larger ships at the Port of Savannah, the Savannah river must be 
deepened from its current depth of 42 feet to 47 feet.
  Georgia has been working on the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project for 
well in excess of a dozen years. Environmental studies have been 
completed, permits have been issued, and state funding has been secured 
for 40 percent of the project. It has the support of every Member of 
the Georgia congressional delegation and every single leader in our 
State, Republican as well as Democrat. This is a unifying bipartisan 
project for us, one that will support hundreds of thousands of jobs 
each year while generating billions of dollars in revenue for the 
entire southeastern United States.
  Until recently we had the support of the Obama administration as 
well. After all, this is exactly the type of project the President has 
been touting as the secret to our economic recovery. He even included 
the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project as one of the four port projects 
in his 2012 ``We Can't Wait'' initiative.
  Vice President Biden visited the Port of Savannah along with Senator 
Isakson, myself, and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx last year, 
and in comments while at the Port of Savannah to the public that was 
gathered, he stated: ``We are going to get this done, come hell or high 
water.''
  Acting U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank visited the 
port in 2012, calling SHEP a national bipartisan priority for this 
administration. Former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood visited 
the Port of Savannah in 2011 promising to find funding for the port 
expansion. In fact, in every conversation I have had with various 
administration officials since this project started in 1997, I have 
been assured that we would find a way to get this project done.
  So you can see how confused I was to learn this week that the 
administration is now stonewalling us on this project by not including 
the project in its 2015 budget. It is baffling to see this 
administration choose to ignore a congressional statute passed just 6 
weeks ago that cleared all remaining obstructions to moving forward 
with this project.
  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 gave clear direction to 
the administration to begin construction on the SHEP project and to 
request the necessary funding. The administration's position as 
evidenced by the Office of Management and Budget is that they will 
ignore the clear guidance from Congress and will instead request more 
funding for unnecessary additional studies this year. Apparently the 
administration would rather pay lip service to Georgians than deliver 
on their promises. The State of Georgia has done its part, and I 
commend Governor Deal and the Georgia legislature, who have committed 
$265 million to start construction. We just need the Federal Government 
to get out of our way so Georgia can begin construction on this very 
vital project.
  The administration can repair some of the damage that has been done 
by finalizing the agreement between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
and the Georgia Ports Authority so that they can begin construction 
with State money that under the leadership of Governor Deal is now 
going to be available. Without any Federal funding at this point in 
time, the State is willing to move forward.
  I urge the administration to move ahead with the securing of that 
agreement between the Army Corps of Engineers and the Ports Authority, 
and let's begin construction.
  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I seek recognition to speak for 10 
minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                             Energy Policy

  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, we have now engaged in a debate over the 
last couple of weeks over whether we should begin to expand a massive 
exportation of American natural gas--our own natural gas--to put it out 
onto the world market as a way of helping Ukraine deal with Russia.
  This whole notion is constantly being invoked, like an incantation--a 
talisman--that somehow or other this is some kind of a magic bullet 
that will help solve the problems in Ukraine. In fact, it really is 
nothing more than another aggregation encyclopedically of discredited 
notions, nostrums, that have no relationship to the reality of the 
global energy marketplace. These are actual arguments being made, false 
premises that do not, in fact, have any likelihood of having any 
substantial impact on the totality of the Ukrainian situation.
  Let me give a few facts as a way of dealing with where we are right 
now. The United States has already approved five export terminals that 
could send 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas abroad. How much 
natural gas is that? Let me tell my colleagues: It is more than twice 
what Ukraine uses in a year. The United States has already

[[Page S1356]]

committed to doing that. More than a quarter of all of the gas Europe 
imports in a year would be ascribable to the amount of natural gas the 
United States has already approved. It would be nearly as much as every 
single U.S. home uses yearly. That is how much natural gas is part of 
the already approved export terminals in this country.
  The Department of Energy found that exporting 4.4 trillion cubic 
feet--a level we will reach within the next approved export terminal--
could raise the price of domestic natural gas up to 54 percent. That 
could mean that American consumers would pay $2.50 more per thousand 
cubic feet. That translates into--listen to this number, I say to my 
colleagues--a $62 billion energy tax every year on American consumers 
and businesses.
  What do I mean by energy tax? I mean that but for that exportation, 
consumers' bills, corporations' bills, would be $62 billion lower per 
year over the next 10 years. Can we imagine the debate here in the 
Senate over increasing $62 billion worth of taxes on Americans in one 
year? We would come to a standstill if we had that kind of debate. But 
because it is part of energy policy, people assume it is something that 
is outside the purview of what should be a great national debate which 
we are having.
  Let me tell my colleagues, low-cost domestic natural gas has allowed 
the United States to add--let me say this--530,000 manufacturing jobs 
since 2010, according to Dow Chemical. If low prices continue, we could 
add 5 million more jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2020. Who says 
this? America's Energy Advantage. Who is in that organization? Dow, 
Alcoa, Nucor, and other major corporations. To what do they relate the 
manufacturing revival in our country? Low prices. Energy that gives 
them a reason to return the manufacturing jobs from overseas.
  Except for the cost of labor, what is the single largest component in 
a manufacturing job? The cost of energy. The lower it is, the more 
likely the manufacturing company will have the jobs here in America. If 
we increase the price by 54 percent or more, which is what many people 
here are now proposing, we reduce the incentive for a manufacturer to 
create those new jobs here in the United States.
  Let me give my colleagues another fact. Every dollar invested in 
domestic manufacturing creates $8 in finished products. Manufacturing 
is at the heart of who we are as a country. This is something that 
right now is a discussion we should have in this country--the 
relationship between low-cost energy and the new manufacturing jobs we 
want to see. We can generate that economic value here in America, but 
if we send our natural gas overseas, that same kind of manufacturing 
future can be constructed in China. Let's have that debate here in our 
country.
  Last month the U.S. chemical industry topped $100 billion in new 
investments as a result of low-cost U.S. natural gas. According to the 
American Chemistry Council, those 148 new factories and expanded 
projects could generate $81 billion per year in new chemical industry 
output and 637,000 new jobs in manufacturing here in the United States 
by the year 2023.
  Now let's go to, in my opinion, some of the complete canards that are 
thrown out about where this natural gas will go if it is put out into 
the free market. First of all, let me say this: We are not Russia. We 
are not Venezuela. We are not a Communist country where the government 
controls where energy goes. No. We are a capitalist country. We are 
proud of it. The decision as to where natural gas is going to go is 
going to be made by the CEOs of oil and gas companies in our country, 
and they are going to send it to where they can get the highest dollar. 
Let me say this right now: The highest dollar is in China. The highest 
dollar is in South America. The highest dollar is not in Ukraine. So 
anyone who thinks that setting up these export terminals and sending 
our natural gas that could be helping our manufacturing sector overseas 
is going to help Ukraine's geopolitical situation doesn't understand 
the geo-economics of it, the geology of it, or the geopolitical 
implications of it. They have not thought through the totality of what 
happens when we take our precious resource and we start spreading it 
around the world.
  Some are going to argue that it helps Ukraine. Well, it is going to 
help China more than it helps Ukraine. It is going to help South 
America more than it helps Ukraine. It is for sure going to help the 
CEOs of big oil and gas companies. That is what this debate is really 
going to be all about. Because we don't captain those ships. ExxonMobil 
has a tiller for those ships, and those ships are going to steer toward 
where the highest price is on the world marketplace. When those LNG 
tankers set sail for Asia or South America, we should know what else we 
are sending abroad on those ships. American jobs will be on those 
ships. They will be sailing to other countries. Fighting climate change 
is on those ships, because we will burn more coal here in the United 
States rather than natural gas, which has half of the pollutants of 
coal. We will be increasing the greenhouse gases the United States of 
America is sending up into the atmosphere.
  When we are sending that natural gas overseas, we will be increasing 
the cost of a conversion of our large bus fleet and our large truck 
fleet over to natural gas as the fuel which makes it possible to drive 
them around our country. Here are the statistics. It is quite simple. 
If we move one-third of our fleet off of oil and on to natural gas as a 
way of fueling large buses and large trucks, then we back out 1 million 
barrels of oil--1 million barrels of oil--per day. That is a signal we 
should be sending to the Middle East. That is a signal that we are 
serious, that we are tired of exporting young men and women overseas 
and getting nothing in return.
  So let me summarize by saying this: No. 1, it is a $62 billion 
consumer tax. No. 2, it slows our conversion from coal over to oil in 
our utility industry. No. 3, it.."

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 2 years ago health insurance companies 
could deny women care due to so-called preexisting conditions, such as 
pregnancy or being a victim of domestic violence. Two years ago women 
were permitted to be legally discriminated against when it came to 
insurance premiums and were often paying more for coverage than men. 
Two years ago women did not have access to the full range of 
recommended preventive care, such as mammograms or contraception and 
more. Two years ago the insurance companies had all the leverage, and 
too often it was women who were paying the price.
  Mr. President, that is why I am proud to come to the floor today, 2 
years after we passed the Affordable Care Act, to highlight just how 
far we have come when it comes to making sure women across America get 
the care they need at a cost they can afford. Because of this law, 
women will be treated fairly when it comes to health care costs. 
Deductibles and other expenses will be capped so a health care crisis 
doesn't cause a family to lose their home or their life savings. 
Preventive care will be free, so women never have to delay care because 
they can't afford to see a doctor. Because of this law women will have 
more options. They can use health care exchanges to pick quality plans 
that work for them and for their families. And if they change jobs or 
move, they will be able to keep their coverage. Because of this law 
maternity care is now covered and women won't have to skip prenatal 
care because they can't afford it. Because of this law women are now in 
charge of their health care, not their insurance companies. That is why 
I feel very

[[Page S1822]]

strongly that we cannot go back to the way things were. While we can 
never stop working to make improvements, we owe it to the women of 
America to make progress and not allow the clock to be rolled back on 
their health care needs.
  I know some of my Republican colleagues are furiously working to undo 
all of the gains we have made in the health care reform law for women 
and for their families. I am disappointed but I am hardly surprised. 
Republicans have been waging war on women's health since the moment 
they came into power. After they campaigned across the country on a 
platform of jobs and the economy, the first three bills they introduced 
in the House were each direct attacks on women's health care in 
America. The very first bill they introduced, H.R. 1, would have 
totally eliminated Title X funding for family planning and teenage 
pregnancy prevention, and it included an amendment that would have 
completely defunded Planned Parenthood and cut off support for the 
millions of women in this country who count on it. Another opening 
round of their bills would have permanently codified the Hyde amendment 
and the DC abortion ban, and the original version of their bill didn't 
even include an exception for the health of the mother. Finally, they 
introduced a bill right away that would have rolled back every single 
one of the gains I just talked about in the Affordable Care Act.
  This law is a winner for women, it is a winner for men and for 
children and for our health care system overall. So I am proud to stand 
here today with so many of my colleagues who are committed to making 
sure the benefits of this law do not get taken away from the women of 
America. We will keep fighting attempts to take them away, and I am 
confident we will win.


                           Export-Import Bank

  Mr. President, while I am on the floor today, I also would like to 
rise to express my strong support for an amendment that will be 
considered today which will grow American jobs, help small businesses, 
generate revenue for taxpayers, and which has strong bipartisan 
backing.
  It is no secret that foreign countries are aggressively trying to 
seize the global market, and America needs to keep fighting back with a 
program that works for businesses and taxpayers and does create 
thousands of jobs. The Export-Import Bank is one of the most important 
resources America has to keep up this fight. For over 75 years the Ex-
Im Bank has supported job-creating U.S. exports by helping American 
businesses sell to the world. No one knows this better than businesses 
in my home State of Washington--the largest exporter in the Nation per 
capita--where one in three jobs in my State is tied to international 
trade. Reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank means more than 150 Washington 
State businesses that rely on this financing to sell their products 
overseas can keep their jobs here at home.
  At a time when our competitors in the global marketplace provide far 
more aggressive export credit financing to companies within their 
borders, the Ex-Im Bank simply levels the playing field for U.S. 
companies that sell goods overseas. And the Ex-Im Bank helps create 
U.S. jobs and does not add to our deficit.
  U.S. exports have been a bright spot in America's road to recovery, 
increasing by about 20 percent over the last 2 years and driving about 
half of all of our economic growth. Given the obvious need for exports 
to power economic growth, it would be negligent to pull the plug on the 
Ex-Im Bank. If we do not pass this bill by the end of this month, 
thousands of jobs will be at risk, not just from our exporters but from 
businesses large and small across the country.
  Reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank would not only be a short-term 
victory for our exporters, it would also tell our trading partners that 
the United States is a stable place to do business and that we stand 
behind our products and our companies. So I urge a ``yes'' vote on that 
amendment when it comes to the floor later.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

        THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES DECISION ON THE 
              CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MARTHA ROBY

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, June 29, 2012

  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep 
disappointment with the recent United States Supreme Court ruling on 
June 28, 2012 that upheld the constitutionality of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).
  The Court's opinion is lengthy and complicated and will require 
careful evaluation and review. However, we know that the Court affirmed 
the view that President Obama's law represents a significant tax on the 
American people, and that it is through the federal government's power 
to levy taxes that the Court upheld the law as constitutional.
  Mr. Speaker, the Court's legal analysis is dubious and cause for 
concern given the dangerous precedent it sets. Can the government now 
require Americans to purchase government-approved goods and services or 
else face the threat of a tax? What we do know, however, is that the 
Court put restraint on the power of Congress to mandate the purchase of 
goods and services under the Commerce Clause of the United States 
Constitution.
  The Court ruled on the legal issues, not the wisdom of the policy. 
The American people have already weighed in and overwhelmingly rejected 
this law. As a whole, the law, which the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office predicts will cost $1.6 trillion and will result in as 
many as 20 million Americans losing their existing health care 
coverage, remains deeply unpopular with the public. This is a stark 
contrast to the President Obama's repeated promise that, ``if you like 
your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.''
  The President's law has also proven to be ineffective at reducing the 
cost of health care, as it is suffocating small businesses with 
overbearing regulations and hampering job creation in a time of 
economic uncertainty. Recent estimates indicate that the law will 
actually cost 800,000 American jobs, not create 400,000 jobs as Nancy 
Pelosi claimed in 2010.
  By law, beginning in 2014, employers with more than 50 employees will 
be required to offer health insurance coverage or face financial 
penalties. In addition, an employer plan must cover a specific set of 
services determined by the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) and meet actuarial standards laid out in the law. As a result, 
employers will be forced to choose whether to meet the new insurance 
requirements, pay noncompliance penalties to the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS), or reduce workers' hours so they do not qualify as full-
time. I have heard from several small business owners in my home state 
of Alabama, and across the United States, that will have financial 
struggles no matter which decision they chose. How can a business owner 
provide health insurance to his employees if his business is bankrupt?
  We can all agree that the Court's preservation of PPACA's employer 
health insurance mandate is costly, to both employers and to their 
employees. Rising costs will force employers to consider dropping 
health coverage

[[Page E1195]]

altogether. Recent polls state that 30 percent of employers will 
``definitely'' or ``probably'' stop offering health insurance after 
2014. In the wake of the Court's ruling, employers will have three 
options in coming years: maintain coverage and absorb cost increases, 
maintain coverage and pass on as many costs as possible to workers, or 
drop coverage and pay a penalty. Despite the court's ruling, I remain 
committed to working toward the repeal of this harmful law.
  The House of Representatives will vote yet again to repeal the law in 
early July and immediately begin deliberate work to replace the law 
with free market reforms that truly improve access to quality and 
affordable care. Americans and their doctors, not federal bureaucrats 
and politicians, are in the best position to determine which health 
care options best meet their individual needs.

               THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE MANDATE DELAYS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, some of the Affordable Care Act's oldest 
and strongest supporters are now coming out against the bill. 
Yesterday, the three largest unions in the country wrote a letter to 
Speaker Pelosi and Leader Reid and said that the President's health 
care takeover would ``destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek 
that is the backbone of the American middle class.'' Their concern--my 
concern--is that the employer mandate will force small businesses to 
move their employees to part time in an effort to avoid additional 
expenses.
  While I wish they had realized this before spending so much time and 
so much money on getting the law passed, at this point I couldn't agree 
with them more.
  This week, it is very important that we pass the bills to delay the 
individual mandate and delay the employer mandate for a year. This will 
give us time to consider how to keep the Affordable Care Act from 
destroying our economy.
  To quote the union's letter:

       Time is running out. We have a problem. You need to fix it. 
     The unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act are 
     severe.

  Further quoting:

       We can no longer stand silent in the face of the elements 
     of the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health 
     care and well-being of millions of hardworking Americans.

  By passing these two bills this week, we will take an important step 
in minimizing the damage from the Affordable Care Act.

                 MORE PROBLEMS WITH AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Gohmert) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, to follow on my dear friend Mr. Franks from 
Arizona's discussion about the so-called Affordable Care Act, I 
continue to hear from people who have lost their insurance, had 
insurance go up significant amounts, it is not affordable.
  Now, I did hear from one of my constituents tonight that about 30 out 
of 147 people at his place of business actually were helped by the 
Affordable Care Act, and that is great. Eighty percent of Americans 
seem to have gotten no help or been greatly harmed by the Affordable 
Care Act. Their insurance has gone up dramatically. They didn't get to 
keep their insurance. They didn't get to keep their doctor. They didn't 
save $2,500. Most Americans have been harmed by the Affordable Care 
Act.
  It is just very hard for me to call it the Affordable Care Act, but 
in this body so often there have been bills which had for a title, such 
as the Affordable Care Act, had a name that was exactly opposite of 
what the bill actually was going to accomplish. The cap-and-trade bill, 
as it was called, certainly didn't help trade, but it sure did cap a 
lot of commerce that could have taken place and would not have been 
able to if that bill had been passed.
  There are just all kinds of bills. Some people are pretty creative in 
the way that they put a name on. There is no law that says the title to 
a bill has to be truthful, and that is how you can end up with a bill 
calling it ``affordable care'' when the majority lose their insurance 
and don't get the care that they need or, for example, find out that in 
3 to 5 years, when they need a new pacemaker, the new law will not 
allow them to get it. Those are problems.
  What I have also found more and more of are senior citizens who are 
now beginning to figure out that when the AARP-endorsed ObamaCare--and 
I don't think it is disrespectful to the President to call the bill 
ObamaCare, just as the President and others called the bill that 
Governor Romney signed in Massachusetts RomneyCare. I don't consider it 
disrespectful to former Governor Romney to call it RomneyCare, and I 
don't think it is disrespectful to call the un-Affordable Care Act 
ObamaCare. So no disrespect to the President intended by referring to 
his signature bill.
  But people have been hurt. People have been moved from full-time 
employment to part-time employment. They liked their insurance policy, 
but then they found out they didn't get to keep it. They have lost it. 
They found out their deductible shot up dramatically, and now they 
don't think that they can afford the thousands of dollars that will be 
required before their insurance policy kicks in.
  We have seen news reports repeatedly about companies that have had to 
drop spouses from coverage or families from coverage or drop coverage 
altogether. We found out that there may be as many as 80 percent of 
those who individually bought their insurance that will or have lost 
their insurance. And so when I see a number projected like 14 million 
Americans will lose their insurance, my understanding is that most of 
these projections about the millions that are losing their insurance 
are actually talking about millions of policies that are lost. So, for 
example, if it were my family when my children were growing up, then it 
would mean not just one policy was lost, but it would mean five people 
lost their insurance. So I think we will continue to see millions and 
millions losing their insurance rather than getting to keep it, which 
is a broken promise.
  Now, there was an article written by Lisa Meyers, and it is 
referenced here in the blog of Ace of Spades, and I don't have the 
article itself here, but a great point is made that it is bad enough 
that we were told over and over: If you like your insurance, you can 
keep it. If you like your insurance, you can keep it. If you like your 
insurance, you can keep it. If you like your insurance, we will make 
sure you can keep it. You want to keep your insurance, you can keep it.
  We were told those types of things over and over by the President 
himself and people speaking for the President as well. And the point is 
made that actually the law itself did not destroy as many insurance 
policies as have now been lost, but so many of the lost insurance 
policies have been forcibly lost by this administration by the law but 
also by the thousands of pages of regulations that have been written. 
And this article points out:

       In other words the ACA, Affordable Care Act, did make it 
     incredibly hard for insurers to continue plans for the 
     millions of Americans who don't want comprehensive insurance. 
     Financially, insurers almost certainly had to adjust them in 
     such a way that they would lose the grandfathered status. 
     This isn't ``normal turnover in the insurance market,'' 
     although there is plenty of that in the individual market. 
     There is a reason why an exceptionally large number of 
     Americans are getting cancelation notices this fall.

  It points out that very often insurance companies will keep premiums 
down despite rising costs of insurance by raising deductibles or 
copayments, and that is precisely what Obama's regulations say makes a 
policy automatically ungrandfathered. So people were told, if you like 
your policy, you can keep it because we are going to grandfather them 
in. The President himself used that term, ``we are going to grandfather 
in these policies.''
  Then his Health and Human Services wrote the regulations in such a 
way that it forced insurance companies to have to change their 
policies, mandated some new coverage if it was going to comply with the 
law, but there were so many things that were written into the 
regulations that forced insurance companies to change their policies 
which meant they could not be grandfathered. So it was bad enough that 
people were promised, if you like your insurance, you can keep it, and 
then there were going to be some people who lost their insurance 
anyway, but then the regulations were written in such a way that it was 
going to force and has forced people to lose their insurance.

  So the President's own Health and Human Services Department has 
created more lost policies by the way they have written the 
regulations. They could have been written in such a way so that the 
President would have been allowed to keep his promise. And all it would 
have taken from a strong leader who wanted to make sure that no 
Department made a liar out of him would have been to either pick up the 
phone or write a letter or have an email sent saying, Hey, don't make a 
liar out of me. Don't you write these regulations in such a way that it 
causes people to lose insurance policies when I promised them they 
won't lose their policies.
  That could have happened, but it didn't happen. In fact, what the 
Health and Human Services Department did, by virtue of the Secretary 
who is in charge, they made sure that millions and millions and 
millions of Americans would lose their health insurance. So it makes 
that point, the Affordable Care Act as written and passed, would have 
protected the grandfathered plans for a longer period of time and with 
more freedom for adjustment, but the Obama administration filled out 
the Secretary's ``shalls,'' and there are so many ``shall this,'' 
``shall do that,'' ``shall do this'' in such a way as to make it that 
much harder, if not basically impossible to do.
  The Obama administration's original June 2010 rules were actually 
even stricter and have, for example, made it impossible for an insurer 
company to change the firms it uses to manage and administer the plan, 
which needn't affect coverage and is a simple way to lower costs. But 
those ludicrous restrictions were eliminated, but enough rules remained 
that it is again near impossible to maintain a grandfathered health 
insurance policy.
  Very tragic. Promises made were not kept.
  And also, I had some folks tell me that, gee, it seems disrespectful 
for Republicans to say, to talk about President Obama without 
mentioning the word ``President.'' It seems disrespectful. And so, Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly don't mean any ill will any time I have used the 
shorthand, and I try to use

[[Page H6894]]

``President Obama,'' but I also hope that my friends, probably every 
one of the Democrats in this body and probably all of the Republicans 
in this body that have referred to anything that happened in the Bush 
administration or used the shorthand rendition ``under Bush'' without 
saying ``President Bush,'' that those people who want President Obama 
to always have ``President'' before ``Obama'' said that they will go 
ahead and apologize for ever referring to Bush without ``President'' in 
front of that.
  But the reason that doesn't necessarily need to happen is I know most 
people didn't mean any ill will by that. Obviously, those who hung 
President Bush in effigy or said some of the most mean-spirited, nasty 
things about President Bush, it never crossed my mind that they might 
be racist, because I thought they just disliked the man. But we are 
hearing now from so many people that if you say something about the 
President, then you must be a racist. I just look so forward to the day 
when the dream of Martin Luther King, one of them, will be realized 
that people will be judged by the content of their character and not by 
the color of their skin.
  I testified today before the Senate Subcommittee of the Judiciary 
about the Stand Your Ground Act, and actually that language comes from 
an 1895 Supreme Court case where the Supreme Court said an individual 
could stand his ground, so that is not a new invention. But I was 
reminded, when people began to talk in terms of racism from stand your 
ground laws, that, as a prosecutor, we didn't care what anybody's race 
was, not as a defendant nor as a victim. Everybody deserved to have 
protection regardless of race, creed, color, gender, national origin.
  But it did remind me that back when I was a judge, judges did not 
select the grand jury, their grand jury members. Those were chosen by 
grand jury commissioners the judges chose, but the commissioners chose 
the panel members for the grand jury.

                              {time}  2130

  There were some defense attorneys that decided to attack the system 
by claiming judges were by a disproportionate number appointing too 
many Anglos as grand jury foreman because that is something that judges 
did in Texas. A judge selected the foreman for the grand jury. He did 
not select the members. But among the members, they would choose who 
the foreman would be.
  I was subpoenaed at one time back then without the defense attorneys 
doing their homework, and they intended to put me on the stand in their 
attack on a racist grand jury foreman system and use that to establish 
that, gee, it was grossly unfair, the disproportionate number of Anglos 
that were chosen as grand jury commissioners. Then, after I was 
subpoenaed and before I testified, they did their homework, and they 
found out that actually it was a disproportionate appointment if you 
only looked at race. I had appointed proportionately more African 
Americans as foremen of my grand jury than the percentage of African 
Americans in my district. The reason I did that was because I did not 
care what anybody's race was. It didn't matter to me. I had to look at 
the backgrounds of the individuals, look at the individuals that were 
on the grand jury, and then select from among those someone that I 
believed would be a leader, would be good at organization, would have 
the respect of the other grand jurors, and be able to work for 6 months 
as head of the grand jury and make good decisions as a peacemaker and 
an organizer.
  I never looked at their race. I didn't care about that. But I 
happened to know the people that I appointed as grand jury foremen. 
Sometimes they were women; sometimes they were men. I couldn't have 
told them, but they went back and checked and, wow, I had appointed a 
majority of African Americans during the time I was in charge of the 
grand jury rather than Anglos. Once they found that out, that blew 
their theory as far as me as a witness. So they quickly sent word that 
my subpoena had been dismissed and my testimony was not desired 
because, clearly, I wasn't going to help them establish a case of 
district judges being racist.
  I can remember a couple of the grand jury foremen I selected. It had 
nothing to do with race. They were good people. One I remember was a 
community leader, was in so many organizations that everybody respected 
her. I knew she was amazing in organization, a former assistant 
superintendent. Anyway, I feel like so many times people want to use 
the term ``racist,'' and they are like those defense attorneys that 
don't bother to check the facts before they start mouthing off.
  Another article that I saw in the last couple of days disturbed me 
greatly because it follows along in a pattern of abuse of law 
enforcement, of the tools of the administration. It follows along in 
what really amounted to the weaponization of the Internal Revenue 
Service. We still need a special prosecutor to go through and indict 
anyone and bring them to trial, anyone in the IRS that abused their 
positions, anybody that has committed perjury. We need a special 
prosecutor to do that. Obviously, the Justice Department will not, and 
we need someone to do that.
  We have seen how abusive this administration can be using the powers 
of its office to go after people. We also know, despite the promises 
before being elected that this administration would be the most 
transparent in history, it has not been so. More and more mainstream 
reporters are starting to realize that, wait a minute, these guys are 
not even as open as the Bush administration was. I am sorry, the 
President Bush administration.
  This story by John Hayward in Human Events is entitled ``DHS Raids 
Human Events Alumnus, Seizes List of Whistleblowers.'' We also know 
this administration, instead of being the most transparent, has the 
dishonor of having prosecuted more whistleblower or leakers than any 
other administration, in fact, than all other administrations put 
together. It is ruling with an iron fist.
  This article points out that:

       Human Events alumnus Audrey Hudson was the target of a 
     Department of Homeland Security raid in August that was 
     ostensibly related to firearms, but in a new interview with 
     the Daily Caller, she revealed that DHS and the Maryland 
     State Police also just happened to confiscate her files and 
     notes, which included information about whistleblowers inside 
     Homeland Security.
       Hudson says the files were taken without her knowledge and 
     without a subpoena. The Daily Caller confirmed that the 
     search warrant pertained to firearms and ammunition. Even 
     that part of the story seems rather flimsy, but then we get 
     to all those juicy files that got hoovered up during the 
     raid.
       At about 4:30 a.m. on August 6, Hudson said officers 
     dressed--

  That is 4:30 in the morning. It is hard to believe that people 
sleeping peaceably, law abiding citizens, a reporter who has written 
stories using sources within Homeland Security that the administration 
didn't like, they bust into her home with a subpoena and say we are 
here to look for firearms, and instead, without the consent--I would 
say that if the subpoena did not allow for them to take her notes 
pertaining to DHS whistleblowers that provided this reporter 
information, it begs the question that perhaps these law enforcement 
officers acting under color of State law or Federal law stole these 
without due process.
  So it bears looking into. If we had a Justice Department that was 
going to do justice in such an abuse of power, the same kind that would 
actually prosecute people who brought a billy club and intimidated 
voters at a voting location--but that doesn't seem to be the case.
  Anyway, the article says:

       After the search began, Hudson said she was asked by an 
     investigator with the Coast Guard Investigative Service if 
     she was the same Audrey Hudson who had written a series of 
     critical stories about air marshals for The Washington Times 
     over the last decade. The Coast Guard operates under the 
     Department of Homeland Security.
       Hudson said that investigator, Miguel Bosch, identified 
     himself as a former air marshal official.
       But it wasn't until a month later, on Sept. 10, that Hudson 
     was informed by Bosch that five files, including her 
     handwritten and typed notes from interviews with numerous 
     confidential sources and other documents, had been taken 
     during the raid.
       In particular, the files included notes that were used to 
     expose how the Federal Air Marshal Service had lied to 
     Congress about the number of airline flights there were 
     actually protecting against another terrorist attack, Hudson 
     wrote in a summary about the raid provided to The DC.
       The Coast Guard was involved because Audrey's husband works 
     for them as an ordnance technician. What was the reason given 
     for grabbing his wife's files?

[[Page H6895]]

       She said she asked Bosch why they took the files. He 
     responded that they needed to run them by TSA to make sure it 
     was ``legitimate'' for her to have them.

  I am sorry. Legitimate for a reporter to have her own handwritten 
notes? What kind of a country are we living in that busts into 
somebody's home at 4:30 in the morning to take her notes regarding 
whistleblowers at Homeland Security? We are living in a scary time.

  Back to the article.

       This guy basically came in here and took my anonymous 
     sources and turned them over--took my whistleblowers--and 
     turned it over to the agency they were blowing the whistle 
     on,'' Hudson said. ``And these guys still work there.''
       Hudson says none of the documents were classified, and no 
     laws were broken in obtaining them. She said the government 
     papers in her possession were obtained through a Freedom of 
     Information Act request, an assertion the Coast Guard 
     confirmed. And how did they confirm it? They handed the 
     material over to the ``source agency'' for review--or, as 
     Hudson put it, they turned the whistleblower information over 
     to the agency that had the whistle blown against it.
       It wasn't just official documents that were seized, 
     however. Hudson says they also ``took four other files with 
     my handwritten and typed interview notes with confidential 
     sources, that I staked my reputation as a journalist to 
     protect under the auspices of the First Amendment of the 
     Constitution.'' One of her major reasons for coming forward 
     with the story is to give the whistleblowers a heads-up, 
     because she's ``terrified to contact them'' directly.

  This is unbelievable. This is happening in America. Mr. Speaker, I 
think we should defund the Department of Homeland Security until such 
time as they start being honest about what they are doing and we get 
answers from the Justice Department. They need to be addressed until 
they provide the information that the Attorney General has been held in 
contempt for. We want to make sure law enforcement services are done, 
we fund those, but we don't defund the Attorney General himself or the 
head of DHS until such time as they start complying with the 
requirements of the law, like Americans across the country are required 
to do without this kind of abuse.
  We have got to stop the abuse. We have the power to do it. All we 
have to do is defund it until they come within the letter of the law 
themselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. After 41 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the 
Republicans want the administration to believe that they now want only 
a delay. Why don't they state that forthrightly? Why don't they say 
they are now for the Affordable Care Act, but they want to delay it 
because of certain issues and bring them forward?
  Instead, their call for delay is still about their opposition 
altogether to the Affordable Care Act. One hundred thousand Americans 
are already receiving benefits under the Affordable Care Act. Do you 
really want us to yank them back from benefits that they have never 
received before? That doesn't make a lot of sense.

[Pages S7412-S7415]
           SIXTH MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks exactly 6 months since the 
Affordable Care Act became law. And this truly is a banner day, because 
a key feature of the new law, the Patient's Bill of Rights, goes into 
effect--cracking down on the worst abuses of health insurance companies 
and giving Americans important new protections. These reforms are long 
overdue, and represent a new day in American health care. We are 
creating a reformed health insurance system that works in the interest 
of working Americans and their families--the healthy and the sick--and 
not just to boost the profits of insurance companies and the bonuses of 
their executives.
  Starting today, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to 
cancel your policy if you get sick. They must end their abusive 
practice of scouring your health records for an excuse--any excuse--to 
cancel your coverage and leave you high and dry when you need insurance 
the most. One major insurer actually targeted women who were newly 
diagnosed with breast cancer. No longer will insurance companies be 
allowed to reward employees with bonuses for cancelling policies in 
order to pad company profits. This cruel practice, at long last, is 
illegal.
  Starting today, children with preexisting conditions can no longer be 
denied health insurance. This will ensure that all children receive 
access to preventive care and needed treatments and healthy start at 
life.
  Beginning today, lifetime benefit limits on your health insurance 
plan will be banned, and annual benefit limits will be restricted. Over 
100 million Americans have health plans that include a lifetime limit, 
which, in times of serious illness, can cause the loss of coverage when 
patients need it the most. No longer will a diagnosis of an acute 
illness such as cancer or ALS lead a patient to rapidly max out their 
health benefits.
  Starting today, parents will no longer have to worry that their 
children will be kicked off their health insurance plan when they turn 
19 or finish college. Today, millions of American families with young 
adult children who don't receive health insurance through their 
employer will be able to keep their children on their family plan until 
age 26. I know that in my State of Iowa, this will help over 8,300 
young adults this year.
  Today, Americans receive yet another protection against health 
insurance company abuses. Starting today, if an insurer refuses to pay 
for your test or treatment, you are guaranteed the right to appeal that 
decision. If your appeal through the company is not favorable, you have 
the right to an independent appeal by a third-party reviewer. This is 
one of many new reforms that will keep insurance companies from 
boosting profits at the expense of sick patients.
  And finally, today is a landmark day in the effort to transform our 
current sick care system into a true health care system--one focused on 
wellness, prevention, and public health--keeping people out of the 
hospital in the first place. That is why I am particularly pleased 
that, starting today, health plans must cover proven preventive 
services at no cost to the patient. This means that, starting today, 
you can visit your doctor for tests such as mammograms and 
colonoscopies for prenatal care, or for immunizations such as the 
seasonal flu shot, without paying a deductible, co-pay, or coinsurance. 
This represents an enormous benefit to the health of Americans, and to 
the well-being of this country. Because there is no better way to bend 
the cost curve downward than by keeping people healthy and catching 
illness in its earliest stages.
  As I travel around the country, I hear from so many folks who have 
already benefitted from health care reform, and look forward to the 
many additional improvements still to come. I hear from mothers who are 
relieved their children can no longer be denied coverage for their 
asthma, from working families who will no longer have to worry about 
the cost of a co-pay for their annual flu shot, and from seniors who 
have received a $250 rebate check to help with the cost of their 
prescription drugs.
  Starting in January, seniors will also receive free preventive 
services--plus an annual wellness visit--through Medicare.
  I talk to small business owners who have benefitted from the tax 
credits that make providing health coverage to their employees more 
affordable.
  I would like to take a moment to share how health reform is helping 
everyday Americans by putting people ahead of profits. I recently 
learned about the case of a young Iowan from Cedar Falls, Sarah 
Posekany. She is just one of millions of Americans who have been 
plunged into financial ruin because their insurance company cut them 
off after they got sick.

[[Page S7413]]

  Sarah was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when she was 15 years old. 
During her first year of college, she ran into complications from 
Crohn's, forcing her to drop her classes in order to heal after 
multiple surgeries. Because she was no longer a full-time student, her 
parents' private health insurance company terminated her coverage.
  As Sarah puts it: ``They didn't want to help, so I had to let the 
medical bills pile up.''
  Four years later, she found herself $180,000 in debt, and was forced 
to file for bankruptcy.
  Sarah has undergone seven surgeries. And here is what is most 
disturbing: Two of those surgeries came as a direct result of her not 
being able to afford medication.
  Sarah said: ``When I don't have any insurance, and can't afford to 
treat myself, the disease progresses to the point where I need 
surgery.''
  Sarah still wants to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse. But her 
bankruptcy and crippling debt will follow her wherever she goes, all 
because her parents' insurance company cancelled her coverage exactly 
when she needed it most.
  Today is the day that we put a stop to these kinds of tragedies--
experiences like Sarah's, that are a stain on our past. Today, our 
health system takes another giant step toward working not just for the 
healthy and the wealthy but for all Americans.
  These reforms represent such enormous progress, such a dramatic 
improvement in the daily lives of millions of Americans. Frankly, I am 
astounded that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to 
call for the repeal of these historic reforms.
  In fact, just this past weekend, a major contender for their party's 
Presidential nomination publicly stood up for insurance companies to 
defend one of their most egregious practices: discriminating against 
people based on preexisting conditions. He said that health insurance 
companies shouldn't be obligated to cover preexisting conditions--and 
let's not forget that insurers include pregnancy and domestic violence 
on their list of preexisting conditions--because paying for the care of 
the sick is like insuring a building that is on fire.
  If that's how they characterize the millions of Americans with heart 
conditions, the millions of Americans who are cancer survivors, and the 
millions of Americans born with health conditions they have no control 
over--comparing them to burning buildings--then I can understand why it 
is so easy for them to lock arms with insurance companies and defend 
their discriminatory practices.
  What this sort of thinking indicates to me is that many Republicans 
are sadly out of touch with the priorities of the American people. They 
continue to argue for repeal of a bill that puts an end to the most 
appalling health insurance company abuses.
  They want to drag us back to a day where a bad diagnosis not only 
meant a health challenge but potential financial ruin.
  They have spent months using scare tactics like claiming the bill 
cuts Medicare and hurts seniors when it actually strengthens Medicare. 
So far this year, seniors have seen prescription drug price relief, and 
very soon they will enjoy free preventive care and lower Medicare 
Advantage premiums.
  Do my friends on the other side of the aisle really want to repeal 
the ban on denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions?
  Do they want to overturn the provision allowing children to stay on 
their parents plan until they are 26 or can receive coverage through an 
employer?
  Do they really want to turn to our youth at a time when they are most 
vulnerable and starting out in life and say, ``Sorry, when you get 
sick, you're on your own?''
  Do they want to repeal the ban on insurance companies cancelling your 
policy if you get a serious illness like cancer or heart disease?
  Do they want to repeal the ban on lifetime benefit limits and allow 
insurance companies to cut off your coverage when they determine your 
care hurts profits too much?
  I can't for the life of me understand why Republicans think that 
repealing these new protections and benefits, and going back to the bad 
old days when health insurance companies held all the cards, is what 
Americans want.
  And what about the health reform law's reduction of the deficit? I am 
just at a loss as to why Republicans are calling for the repeal of a 
law that ends insurance company abuses, expands access to care, and 
reduces the deficit by $143 billion in the next 10 years, and by nearly 
$1 trillion in the years after that.
  There are so many good things in the health reform law, and there is 
much more to come. Just this week, a Families USA report highlighted 
the benefits this law will bring to my State of Iowa. When the full law 
kicks in, in 2014, over 261,000 Iowans will qualify for tax credits to 
help them purchase health insurance. These tax credits, which amount to 
one of the largest middle-income tax cuts in American history, will 
reduce Federal income taxes for Iowans by $974 million in the first 
year alone. And these tax breaks are targeted toward working families 
who have long struggled with the increasing cost of health insurance.
  We have reached a historic moment in the history of American health 
care. A moment where the promise of health reform is becoming a reality 
for Americans. A moment where all patients--not just the healthy and 
the wealthy--have the rights and protections they need and deserve.
  The Patient's Bill of Rights--the critical new protections that take 
effect today--is a giant step forward for the health and economic 
security of the American people.
  Health reform is off to a very strong start. As many predicted, the 
new health reform law is growing increasingly popular as people get 
better acquainted with its broad array of benefits and protections. 
They like the new law's sharp emphasis on wellness and prevention. They 
want every American to have access to quality, affordable health care. 
They like the tax cuts to help working families afford health coverage.
  And make no mistake: the American people are not going to allow these 
benefits and rights to be taken away.
  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for each of us, our health is among the 
things we care the most about. Certainly one of the most common 
requests any of us regularly make in prayer is for good health. And of 
course it is not only our own health we worry about; we also want good 
health and proper medical insurance for our children, our parents, our 
siblings--for all those who are important to us.
  Medical knowledge and technology have advanced tremendously during 
the past two and a half centuries of American life, and the pace of 
medical progress is accelerating. But health insurance models have not. 
The deck has been stacked in favor of the insurance companies, and 
against the practical needs of ordinary Americans. For much of the last 
century Americans have pointed to the obvious need for insurance 
reform, yet the problems have only grown worse and more urgent, leaving 
millions of Americans exposed to the ravages of sudden illness and the 
wasting effects of declining health.
  Six months ago today, President Obama signed into law the Affordable 
Care Act, which will extend health insurance coverage to more than 30 
million uninsured Americans in the next few years. Reform based on good 
quality, affordable health insurance that has been talked about for 
decades is finally becoming a reality. Over 15 months starting last 
year, Congress debated and then passed the most sweeping and 
comprehensive reforms to improve the everyday lives of every American 
since Congress passed Medicare in 1965. It was an arduous process, but 
in the end the achievement proved that change is possible and that 
voices of so many Americans who over the years have called on their 
leaders to act have finally been heard.
  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of 
insurance reform. First, in states where individuals and families are 
excluded from health coverage because of preexisting medical 
conditions, these Americans can now buy insurance through special 
insurance plans overseen by the states and delivered by private medical 
providers. Second, employers across the country already have applied 
for and have been awarded early retiree reinsurance grants that will 
reimburse employers for retirees' medical claims.

[[Page S7414]]

Third, seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions typically 
fall within a coverage gap known as the ``doughnut hole.'' Beginning 
recently, beneficiaries who fall within the gap will receive $250 
checks to help cover the cost of their prescription drugs.
  And today, more benefits of real insurance reform go into effect that 
will help consumers take control of their own health care decisions. 
Known as the Patients' Bill of Rights, these new rules protect 
consumers against the worst health insurance industry abuses that have 
prevented millions of people from receiving the health care they need. 
Going forward, insurance plans can no longer deny children coverage 
because of a preexisting health condition; insurance plans are barred 
from dropping beneficiaries from coverage simply because of an illness; 
dozens of preventive care services must be covered at no cost and with 
no co-pay; Americans will have access to an easier appeals process for 
private medical claims that are denied; and adult children can stay on 
their parents' plans until their 26th birthdays.
  Yet another major reform now protects everyday Americans from one of 
the most egregious insurance industry practices: setting lifetime or 
annual limits on health insurance coverage. Wherever I travel in 
Vermont I am often stopped in the grocery store, at church, on the 
street or at the gas station to listen to personal, wrenching stories 
from Vermonters who can no longer get medical treatment because they 
have met their annual or lifetime maximum. Many of these Vermonters 
were perfectly healthy before being diagnosed with cancer or diseases 
that can cost well beyond their means for treatment. Instead of being 
able to focus on getting healthy, patients instead must worry about 
whether or not their next doctor's visit will shove them above the 
insurance company's arbitrary limit.
  Each of these stories is anguishing. Let me describe just one of 
them. A master's student from Saint Michael's College's graduate 
school, Ned wrote my office during the health care reform debate to 
share his story. A car accident when Ned was nine left him a 
quadriplegic. His health care costs since then have necessarily been 
high. In fact, recently Ned found that he had nearly met his lifetime 
limit on coverage from one plan and his only remaining option for 
health insurance coverage not only contained a lifetime cap on coverage 
but also a cap on expenses for durable medical equipment, which he uses 
frequently because of his wheelchair. But beginning today, Ned and 
millions of other Americans who fear reaching their coverage limits can 
rest easier knowing that their insurance will be there when they need 
it the most. Ned, and we, can look forward to a lifetime of the 
contributions that he will make to his community and our country.
  In addition to improvements to our health insurance system that we 
will see this year, over time the Affordable Care Act will insure 95 
percent of our population and make a substantial investment in our 
economic vitality in the years ahead. In addition to ending the 
discriminatory insurance company practices of denying coverage because 
of a preexisting condition or canceling coverage when beneficiaries get 
sick, the new law will lower costs for small businesses and individuals 
who simply cannot afford health coverage. And despite the specious 
arguments from opponents of reform, this bill is the largest deficit 
reduction measure upon which many in Congress will ever cast a vote. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that comprehensive reform 
will reduce the federal deficit by $143 billion through 2019, and by 
more than $1 trillion in the decades to come.
  The Affordable Care Act is a tremendous achievement that will improve 
the lives of Americans for generations to come. For decades, we have 
heard heartbreaking stories about the enormous challenges Americans 
face because they are uninsured or underinsured. With each new 
implementation date of the features of the Affordable Care Act, these 
stories are becoming fewer and fewer and are being replaced by stories 
of the success of these reforms, one family at a time, all across 
Vermont and all across America.
  There is still much more to accomplish, and there are still millions 
of Americans who are struggling to buy or keep adequate health 
insurance coverage for their families or themselves. As these reforms 
are implemented over the next few years, I will continue to work with 
Vermonters and the Department of Health and Human Services to help 
Americans have the access to the quality, affordable health insurance 
that each American needs and deserves.
  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important 
milestone in the effort of delivering meaningful health reform for all 
Americans. Six months ago, President Obama signed the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act into law, and the first major 
patient protections now take effect to help Americans obtain and keep 
meaningful health care coverage.
  I am reminded of all the South Dakotan families and businesses that 
have contacted me to voice their thoughts about health care, share 
their personal experiences, and find out how reform will help them. 
Reforms in place today end some of the worst insurance industry abuses 
by implementing a Patient's Bill of Rights. These provisions protect 
children with a preexisting condition from being denied coverage, allow 
parents to provide insurance for their children through their young 
adult years, prohibit profit-driven insurance companies from rescinding 
benefits as soon as someone becomes sick and eliminate lifetime limits 
and restrict annual limits on benefits.
  As more provisions of the Affordable Care Act are implemented, it is 
important we do not forget the health care crisis facing our Nation and 
the consequences of inaction. The latest U.S. Census report confirms 
that, while some were spinning mistruths about a government takeover of 
health care, more and more Americans were losing their health insurance 
coverage. Last year, the number of insured individuals and families 
dropped for the first time the Census starting tracking that data in 
1987. Nearly 51 million Americans are uninsured, compared to 46 million 
the previous year. The Affordable Care Act puts in place assurances 
that no more Americans will be priced out of the private health 
insurance market or denied coverage by discriminatory insurance 
practices. Americans will no longer pay more every year for fewer 
benefits, be denied coverage for a preexisting medical condition, or 
lose coverage altogether just for getting sick.
  The Patient's Bill of Rights taking effect today eliminates the worst 
practices of the insurance industry that took advantage of American 
families for far too long. But insurance market reforms alone will not 
address all shortcomings of our health care system. The Affordable Care 
Act also includes important investments in strengthening and growing 
our health care workforce, improving access to preventive and wellness 
programs, and addressing waste, fraud and abuse.
  I supported health care reform to give our Nation the best chance of 
improving our system and reigning in costs. One of our biggest 
challenges remains the fact that we spend more on health care than any 
other country, 50 percent more per capita than the next highest 
spender, and yet have poorer health outcomes than most. Health reform 
cannot change that fact overnight, but it does provide us with a path 
forward and the tools to improve the way our system works for everyone. 
Health economists have noted that reform finally implements a myriad of 
bipartisan proposals to rein in costs that have been circulating for 
decades. These commonsense changes to our health care delivery system 
will ensure we are getting our money's worth and ensure citizens have 
access to affordable health care. Health reform has made a significant 
step forward in addressing the drivers behind increasing health care 
costs and placing us in a more fiscally sustainable direction.
  The new law isn't perfect--few major pieces of legislation are--and 
the work is not finished in delivering meaningful health reform for all 
Americans. But with inaction not an option, the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act laid the foundation for improving the American 
health care system. The new law is a product of compromise and in that 
same spirit I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure health 
reform is delivering for South Dakotans and all Americans.

          REPEAL OF PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT


                             General Leave

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 45.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 679, I call 
up the bill (H.R. 436) to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act and health care-related provisions in the Health Care and 
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 215, the 
amendment printed in House Report 113-59 is considered adopted, and the 
bill, as amended, is considered read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 45

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF PPACA AND HEALTH CARE-RELATED PROVISIONS 
                   IN THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION 
                   ACT OF 2010.

       (a) PPACA.--Effective as of the enactment of the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), such 
     Act is repealed, and the provisions of law amended or 
     repealed by such Act) are restored or revived as if such Act 
     had not been enacted.
       (b) Health Care-Related Provisions in the Health Care and 
     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.--Effective as of the 
     enactment of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
     of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), title I and subtitle B of title 
     II of such Act are repealed, and the provisions of law 
     amended or repealed by such title or subtitle, respectively, 
     are restored or revived as if such title and subtitle had not 
     been enacted.

     SEC. 2. BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF THIS ACT.

       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of 
     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall 
     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled 
     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, 
     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the 
     Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
     Representatives, as long as such statement has been submitted 
     prior to the vote on passage of this Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Debate shall not exceed 2 hours equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce, the chair and ranking 
minority of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the chair and the 
ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means.
  The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Waxman) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  You know, it is just absolutely amazing that we are once again here 
on the floor to repeal ObamaCare, but it is a necessary step that we 
find that we have to do.
  It is so interesting being out in my district. Whether I am talking 
to State-elected officials or county-elected officials or talking to 
those who are employers in our district--those who are job creators--
repeatedly we hear from them: this is a bill that turned into a law 
that is too expensive to afford.
  One of the reasons--and I would point this out--this is a copy of the 
law as published. What it has turned into is 13,000 pages of 
regulation. Indeed, I wanted to bring that tower of red tape here to 
the floor today. It is seven feet tall and growing. It was too big to 
be allowed on the House floor.
  It is amazing that much regulation that has come from this 2,700-page 
bill. Now we find out from The Washington Post and The New York Times 
that Secretary Sebelius had conversations with some companies and 
organizations asking them to help fund getting this started.
  Why is this happening? Three years ago, we were told it would be an 
$800 billion bill. And guess what? When we went to the Budget Committee 
this year, $2.6 trillion is the estimated cost of this bill. So 
insurance--more expensive. It was to save households $2,500 a year, but 
instead they're already paying $3,000 more. And the survey that 
Chairman Murphy ran for us in the Energy and Commerce Committee shows 
that the cost will go anywhere up to about 400 percent, depending on 
who you are, what group you're in. That's what you're going to see your 
insurance cost go up to.
  We hear from physicians. Harder to get in to see a physician? Yes, it 
is.
  Our goal should be about how do we preserve access to affordable 
health care for all Americans. Instead, what my friends across the 
aisle have done is to focus on how do you centralize health care, run 
up the cost, and decrease access. That is the reason that we are here 
on the floor today.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
  I rise today in opposition to the Patients' Rights Repeal Act because 
what the Republicans will do is take away all the benefits the American 
people are already seeing under this law and they will stop the full 
implementation of it to provide millions of people with health 
insurance opportunities.
  Our Republican colleagues say they want to provide access to health 
care. They want to do something about people with preexisting 
conditions. They say they care about stopping discriminatory practices. 
They want to lower the deficit. They want to stop rising health care 
costs. This bill, the Affordable Care Act, is the one piece of 
legislation that takes major steps on these issues.
  Republicans offered nothing but opposition over and over again. This 
is the 37th time the House will vote to repeal the patients' rights 
bill. From the very beginning, the Republicans opposed it. They said it 
will kill jobs, and they were wrong. They said the law would drive up 
health care costs through the roof. They were wrong. We're seeing the 
slowest growth in health care spending in decades.
  They've ignored the significant benefits that are helping tens of 
millions of people, such as 3 million young adults who have coverage 
through their parents' plans, 6 million seniors who have saved over $6 
billion on their prescription drugs, 13 million Americans who have 
received over $1 billion in rebates from their insurers, over 100 
million Americans who have access to free preventive care who no longer 
face lifetime limits on their coverage. And the Congressional Budget 
Office still confirms that the law cuts the deficit by $100 billion in 
the first decade and more than $1 trillion in the second.

[[Page H2683]]

  The Republican Patients' Rights Repeal Act undoes all of these 
benefits. They add to the deficit, and they send us back to the days 
when insurance companies were in charge, costs were skyrocketing, and 
tens of millions either had no coverage--especially if they had 
preexisting conditions--or coverage that they could depend on.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as he may 
consume to the chairman of the Health Care Subcommittee, the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).
  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, in two separate forums, I met with 
members of the Lancaster County and the Chester County Chambers of 
Commerce, representing dozens of businesses and municipalities across 
my district, about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Every 
single one of them had grave concerns with the law. They're confused 
and deeply concerned about how it will affect their ability to provide 
care and jobs.
  We're only a few months away from implementation of the employer 
mandate, and there are many unanswered questions. Each employer I 
talked to had pressing questions, but time and again I had to tell them 
that I didn't have an answer because HHS, the IRS, or the Department of 
Labor hadn't issued rules or guidance yet.

                              {time}  1500

  This uncertainty is leaving them paralyzed, holding off on hiring and 
wondering whether they will be able to provide coverage for their 
employees.
  It is not just businesses that are hurting. I heard from school 
districts operating on tight budgets who said they have no choice but 
to outsource loyal hourly employees like cafeteria workers and special 
ed aides, going to part-time work.
  Workers are losing their jobs, losing work hours, losing benefits to 
this bureaucratic nightmare. Let's stop the damage, and let's repeal 
the train wreck before it occurs.
  Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that our time from 
the Energy and Commerce Committee be controlled by our subcommittee 
ranking member, Congressman Frank Pallone from the State of New Jersey.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from New 
Jersey will control the time.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
  I rise today in opposition to the Patients' Rights Repeal Act. I 
greatly respect my colleagues on the other side from Tennessee and from 
Pennsylvania, but I have to say they are simply obstructionists.
  This is what we get from the GOP on a daily basis. Nothing happens 
here in the House of Representatives. We know there is a problem. 
Historically, there has been a problem with health care and a lot of 
people not having insurance or having discriminatory practices or not 
being able to get on their parents' insurance policy. So we as 
Democrats came up with a solution, and that solution is working.
  We have kids now--almost 6 million or 7 million kids--that are now on 
their parents' policies. We have a situation where we are plugging up 
the doughnut hole in Medicare for part D prescription drugs for 
seniors. We have all kinds of preventive care that is out there 
relative to women's health. And the list goes on and on. These things 
are happening. Beginning next year, most Americans will have health 
insurance.
  What do I hear from the other side? They don't want solutions. I'll 
be honest with my colleagues: if you really care, why don't you make 
some suggestions, and maybe we can work together. Anything can be 
improved. I don't say that anything can't be improved.
  But, no, they come on the floor, and what do they want to do? Just 
repeal it, which is not a solution. It basically would eliminate all 
the progress that we have made in terms of health care.
  Yes, costs are not going up as much. And, yes, people are getting 
rebates if their insurance companies charge them too much. All these 
things are happening because of the Affordable Care Act.
  All I hear from you is: no, obstructionism. No, we have to repeal 
this because this is such a terrible thing. Bringing in all these 
distractions about what the Secretary of Health and Human Services is 
doing.
  This is not what you are elected to do. You are not elected to come 
here and just repeal things and say how bad everything is. You are 
supposed to come up with solutions. I never hear it from the other side 
of the aisle. I simply do not hear it, which is why I get very upset 
the 37th time, the 38th time we are going to vote on the same thing, 
which is repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to respond.
  We trust our constituents and the American people. We don't need 
government control of this. Certainly we don't need the IRS policing 
our private health care information. There is nothing affordable about 
the Affordable Care Act, and that is why we are concerned.
  At this point, I want to yield 1 minute to the chairman of our 
conference, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, from Washington.
  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, when President Obama's health 
care proposal became law, he told us that it would lower costs, improve 
quality, cover everyone with preexisting conditions, and ensure that 
those under 26 would remain insured. But today, when we pull back the 
curtain, the American people see that this law has just made things 
worse.
  The President promised that premiums would go down. In fact, he said 
families would see an average decrease in premiums by $2,500. Instead, 
the average family has seen premiums go up by over $3,000. And they are 
hitting young people hard, some facing increases up to 200 percent and 
many losing insurance.
  The President promised those with preexisting health conditions would 
be covered. Unfortunately, just over 100,000 people enrolled in the 
program before he declared it ran out of money.
  The President promised that his plan would lead to all Americans 
having health insurance. But CBO already estimates that 30 million 
people will still be uninsured even after the law is fully implemented.
  We need to replace this policy with one that helps Americans.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to our chairman emeritus 
from Michigan (Mr. Dingell).
  (Mr. DINGELL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, this is a prodigious waste of the time of 
the House working on a bad piece of legislation. I rise today in strong 
opposition to the Patients' Rights Repeal Act.
  My Republican colleagues are up for the 37th time with this nonsense, 
and they are fully determined to take away all of the rights that we 
have given under the Affordable Care Act to the people of the United 
States.
  People are going to go back in the doughnut hole, courtesy of the 
Republicans. No longer will people be protected against being excluded 
from insurance because of preexisting conditions. And it is going to be 
possible now for insurance companies to kick people off insurance plans 
because they get sick while they have a policy. Kids are not going to 
go on their parents' policies after they are 26 if we pass this 
nonsensical legislation.
  Einstein said that expecting a different result from things done over 
and over again is proof of insanity. Well, this is insanity. But worse 
than that, it is a waste of time of the people in the Congress and the 
money of the United States citizens who pay our wages.
  This is a bad proposal. Vote it down.
  Mr. Speaker, it has often been said by many, including everyone from 
Albert Einstein to Benjamin Franklin, that the very definition of 
insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different 
results.
  We gather here in this Chamber today not to work on behalf of the 
American people, but instead to partake in our 37th round of insanity--
repeal of a law that is already helping our struggling American 
families.
  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: just what part of 
helping the American people are you opposed to? Are you content in this 
preposterous display that is, by its very definition, insanity?
  You are reinstating the lifetime cap on coverage for people--
including children--telling

[[Page H2684]]

them there's nothing more that can be done for them, because their 
insurance provider said so.
  You are ending the closing of the so-called ``donut hole'' and 
allowing millions of seniors to see increases in prescription drug 
costs, amounting to thousands and thousands of dollars in additional 
burdens on our seniors.
  You are eliminating tax credits for more than 4 million American 
small businesses that stand to benefit from providing coverage for 
their workers, ensuring they can continue to work and provide for their 
business in good health and wellness.
  You are telling the American people that it's fine for insurance 
companies to drop them from coverage just because they got sick.
  You are returning our American children to the uncertain and 
vulnerable times when ``preexisting conditions'' meant their life and 
livelihood was less important than the bottom lines of insurance 
executives.
  You are denying care for 6.6 million young people who qualify to stay 
on their parents' plan until age 26. Is that your preferred way of 
protecting and promoting the future leaders of our nation?
  My friends, all that this 37th repeal vote offers is yet another 
piece of evidence in proving the newfound insanity of this body, 
further emulating the ``do-nothing'' Congress that was the 112th.
  This is not what we should be wasting our time with--this is nothing 
more than political posturing so House Freshmen can make the same 
foolish mistakes of their most immediate predecessors.
  This is not a vote for the American people, rather it is a callous 
disregard for the health and wellbeing of those who continue to work, 
each and every day, to make our nation great, provide for their 
families and ask for nothing more than a fair shot at the American 
Dream.
  I will remind my colleagues that the very best way of protecting the 
American Dream is by protecting the American people--the very best 
asset our country holds.
  We should be doing the nation's business in a cooperative manner, not 
working to further divide all of us who are so deeply in need of 
bipartisanship and unity.
  Today's insane and useless vote will bring the total amount of 
taxpayer dollars wasted on hours upon hours of legislative attempts to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act to $52.4 million dollars in just three 
years since it became the law of the land, and just one year since the 
Supreme Court upheld it and ensured the care and cost-saving measures 
that all American families deserve.
  I ask you, my colleagues, to oppose this insane legislation, end this 
further waste of taxpayer dollars, and bring this body back to the 
honest and necessary job we owe to the people we're blessed to 
represent.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the 
chairman of the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee at Energy and 
Commerce, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy).
  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the health care bill, 
indeed, has some good things in it: no lifetime cap, kids on their 
parents policy, people can't be denied, and some prevention. But good 
intentions do not guarantee good results.
  Because of the guarantee of this bill, we were told it would lower 
costs; and we are now in a position where it may cost families more, 
and they won't be able to cover it.
  On top of $835 billion in taxes, our Energy and Commerce Committee 
did a study. Getting responses from 17 insurance companies, they 
reported there will be a 96 percent increase in cost for those getting 
a new policy, 73 percent for those keeping, and some will be as high as 
413 percent. Some will see lower costs, but most Americans will see 
some increase in the health care costs.
  That is a reason why we need to repeal this and get back to really 
reforming health care, keeping the good parts. But Americans cannot 
afford this. And when it is not affordable, it is not accessible care.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Engel).
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, here we are again voting for the 37th time to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act, a law the Supreme Court has deemed 
constitutional. This is nothing more than a feel-good moment for new 
Members of the GOP who didn't get to vote on repeal in the last 
Congress.
  If the new standard for scheduling votes is to provide wish 
fulfillment for Members of Congress, then I have a few requests:
  If we are going to vote almost 40 times to repeal health care 
coverage for millions of Americans, I would like to have the chance to 
vote against the Defense of Marriage Act 40 more times. I had the 
pleasure to vote against it in 1996. I am sure there is a new 
generation of Members who would like to vote against it, and I would 
like to do it again.
  Furthermore, I regret being a teenager when the Civil Rights Act was 
voted on. I would like a chance to lend my support to that landmark 
law.
  To be able to cast a vote to go to war against Nazi Germany would be 
very satisfying to me.
  I have contributed to Social Security my whole life; and since my 
father was not a Member of Congress in 1932, I would like to vote on 
his behalf to support the creation of Social Security.
  I was a student of history in my youth, and I feel very strongly that 
the Compromise of 1850 was the point of no return leading to the Civil 
War. I would like a chance to vote against it.
  I ask that the Republican leadership add all of these to the agenda 
in the weeks to come.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. ENGEL. Clearly, we have plenty of time available for wish 
fulfillment, rather than substantive measures such as the economy, 
immigration reform, and putting people back to work.
  So I would like an opportunity to vote again on many different things 
as well.

                              {time}  1510

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. At this time, I yield 1 minute to a member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today, we are once again voting 
to totally repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
ObamaCare.
  Now, the most senior members of the Energy and Commerce Committee 
from the Democratic side stand up here and say this is the 37th time 
that we have voted for total repeal. No, it's the third time. We are 
voting for total repeal for a third time because Republicans and 
Democrats and 65 percent--young and old--of the people across this 
country demand total repeal. They know that they don't want the 
government taking over one-sixth of our economy and Washington 
bureaucrats imposing a massive tax increase on middle class Americans 
and small business owners.
  As the government becomes more involved in health care, doctors and 
patients become further removed--more involved, further removed--from 
their own health care decisions, and this will result in a more 
expensive and a more dysfunctional system. Patients should have more 
control of their medical decisions, and reform should be driven at the 
State level rather than rushing through legislation that we have to 
read to find out what's in it. Now, Mr. Speaker, small businesswomen 
and men have to read a stack of rules and regulations 7-feet high to 
find out that, truly, the devil is in the details.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. As both a physician and a taxpayer, fully 
repealing ObamaCare is my top priority, and I am proud that we will 
soon take yet another step toward this critically important goal.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Green).
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
Patients' Rights Repeal Act.
  Here we go again, and my colleague from Georgia knows it: 37 times, 
counting today, that the Republican majority has tried to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act, a law that was upheld by the Supreme Court, a law 
that will help not only millions of uninsured but everyone with health 
insurance because the Affordable Care Act improves coverage.
  ``Repeal'' means that insurance companies can once again deny 
coverage for preexisting conditions. It means college-aged dependent 
children will be kicked off their parents' insurance. Medicare 
beneficiaries will lose access to vital preventative screenings. Also, 
insurance company practices of the past, which frustrated the insured 
and drained their savings, will be allowed to return.
  The Affordable Care Act means more than 80 percent of premium dollars 
are

[[Page H2685]]

spent on health care. That was in the Affordable Care Act. The law 
prevents insurance companies from providing their executives 
extraordinary perks while failing to provide health care to their 
customers.
  But this will never happen again. The repeal of the Affordable Care 
Act will not be successful. It wasn't successful the first 36 times. It 
won't be today. That's because the American people need it. The law 
isn't perfect. The medical device excise tax and the Independent 
Payment Advisory Board should be addressed. This majority refuses to 
work with our side to fix the problems. The American people want to see 
Congress work together to fix problems. What they don't want is more 
political theater.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the committee.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. I support repealing the misnamed Affordable Care Act 
because it is a law that Americans cannot afford.
  A recent report from the Energy and Commerce Committee shows that 
health insurance premiums for small businesses could rise by an 
astonishing 400 percent. For my home State of Florida, the report notes 
that individuals enrolled in some current plans could see increases of 
over 100 percent. In the small group market, we expect to see increases 
as well. This law is not affordable for individuals or small 
businesses. The health law tries to hide these new costs through 
subsidies and tax credits paid for through new taxes and cuts to 
Medicare.
  We need to repeal this job-crushing, premium-rising, government-
expanding law. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 45, and I support 
repealing this unaffordable act.
  Mr. PALLONE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I just want to set the record straight that there is no 
government takeover in the ACA, which is contrary to what my Republican 
colleagues are saying.
  The ACA is built on expanding private sector coverage by improving 
options in the individual market and by encouraging employers to 
provide coverage. The claim that the ACA is a government takeover is 
totally unfounded. A system built on private insurance, private doctors 
and private hospitals is not a government takeover.
  I yield now 1 minute to my colleague from California (Mrs. Capps).
  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today, yet again, in opposition to the Patients' 
Rights Repeal Act as 3 years and 37 repeal attempts later, the majority 
is still playing politics with the health care of real people.
  Thanks to ObamaCare, 27 million American women now have access to 
preventative health screenings and health care without cost-sharing. 
They can receive cancer screenings, annual wellness physicals and 
contraceptives without extra costs. Seniors in my district saved an 
average of $600 last year on prescriptions, and as we close the 
doughnut hole, the savings will be even greater and families no longer 
have to worry that their children will be denied insurance due to a 
preexisting condition.
  Repeal would take away these benefits and protections, raising costs 
for families. It would return us to a broken system, all the while 
increasing the deficit. It is time to move on. Let's spend our time 
working on new solutions instead of repeatedly placing partisanship 
over progress. I urge the defeat of this bill.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to our 
chairman emeritus of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Barton).
  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BARTON. I thank the gentlelady from Tennessee.
  You've seen the TV commercial about oil filters where somebody brings 
their car in, and they haven't had their oil changed, and the guy says, 
Well, they could have paid me before by changing the oil filter or they 
can pay me later when they bring the car in.
  That's why we're here today. We're going to repeal this Act. We can 
repeal it today or we can repeal it later, but it's going to be 
repealed.
  My friends on the minority side talk about all the good things of it 
and act like there is no government intervention. There is just a 
government mandate that you have to have insurance. There is a 
government mandate that employers have to provide it. There is a 
government mandate on what has to be included in that coverage. There 
is a government price control on the price of the premiums. Of course, 
there is a mandate that everybody in the country has to have insurance, 
and the IRS can enforce that as a penalty if, in fact, you choose not 
to participate in that mandated program. Other than that, there is no 
government involvement in this law.
  So, my good friends, I would say: vote with us to repeal it now so we 
don't have to come back later next year or the year after when health 
care is in a shambles, and we will repeal it then.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Doyle).
  Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Patients' 
Rights Repeal Act.
  Today is actually an embarrassment. Today, for the 37th time, we vote 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act--a messaging vote that is surely dead 
on arrival when it reaches the Senate.
  I would say to my good friend from Texas, you can repeal it in this 
House 37 more times, and it's going to be just as dead when it gets 
over to the Senate.
  This is a waste of our time. A CBS analysis last year said that 
Congress spent 80 hours--2 full weeks of work--on repeal votes that 
cost the taxpayers $48 million. Bryce Covert and Adam Peck of Think 
Progress estimated that, since then, we've spent an additional $6 
million, bringing the total to $55 million on 37 symbolic votes to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act and waste our time here on the floor of 
the Congress. Just think what we could have done with $55 million. We 
could make sure college students have access to Federal work study 
grants. We could keep low-income kids in preschool.
  Quit wasting the taxpayers' money and this Congress' time. You should 
be ashamed of yourselves.


                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind all persons in the 
gallery that they are here as guests of the House and that any 
manifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings or other 
audible conversation is in violation of the rules of the House.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. At this time, I yield 1 minute to one of our 
freshmen, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).

                              {time}  1520

  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
45, and I thank our leadership for bringing this legislation to the 
floor because contrary to popular opinion, patients' rights were the 
ones in jeopardy a few years ago, and that's what we're restoring.
  Architects of ObamaCare have said it is ``so complicated and if it 
isn't done right the first time, it will just simply get worse.''
  By ``done right,'' they really mean that the administration simply 
has to write enough of the right regulations.
  Nearly 20,000 pages of ObamaCare-related regulations are already on 
the books, including 828 pages that were issued in a single day earlier 
this year. This tidal wave of regulations should be no surprise to 
anyone who bothered to read the health care bill before they voted on 
it.
  With the truth of our economic condition and the real contents of the 
health care bill beginning to sink in, I don't believe there'.."

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk about a number of subjects 
starting, of course, with the fact that millions of Americans have lost 
their health insurances because of the unintended consequences of the 
Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.
  We also know that in addition to losing the coverage they had, which 
they were told they could keep, many have now been forced to pay higher 
premiums. The sticker shock from that has been something we have been 
reading a lot about. But whether there is sticker shock because of the 
higher premiums, many people have been finding that their deductibles 
are huge, making them effectively self-insured up to $5,000 for their 
health care costs, definitely not something they were promised as a 
result of ObamaCare.
  We also know that roughly 10 million people, about 10\1/2\ million 
people, remain unemployed in America and that 3.8 million of them have 
been unemployed for more than 6 months. Since the recession has ended--
and, of course, a recession is, technically speaking, two consecutive 
quarters of negative growth--I think, if asked, most Americans today 
feel as though we are still in a recession because of what is happening 
to them personally. We know that since the recession ended, median 
household income--one measure of economic health in the country--has 
gone down by $2,500. So at the same time people are experiencing higher 
costs for health care, for groceries, for gasoline, and other 
necessities of life, they are seeing that their median household income 
has declined by $2,500--a double whammy.
  According to a Joint Economic Committee analysis, if the Obama 
economic recovery had been as strong as an average post-1960 recovery, 
we would currently have millions more private sector jobs.
  I had the pleasure this last weekend of hearing a fascinating debate 
with Larry Summers, economic adviser and former president of Harvard 
University--a brilliant economist--and another brilliant economist, 
Senator Phil Gramm, who taught at Texas A Senator Gramm was making 
the point that if we had had a typical recovery after a recession, it 
would have been a V-shaped recovery. We did not get that. The economy 
continues to grow slowly, unusually slowly, and they were both 
exploring the reasons for that. A lot has to do with uncertainty about 
the role of the Federal Government when it comes to taxes, when it 
comes to regulation, and when it comes to our escalating national 
debt--now over $17 trillion--and what that might mean in the future.
  But add all this up and Americans are continuing to feel increasingly 
pessimistic about the state of our economy, the state of their personal 
health care relationships with their doctors and hospitals, and the 
future of the country. That is something all of us ought to be 
profoundly concerned about.
  Yet rather than promote real health care reform that actually deals 
with the unaffordability of health coverage or something that will get 
the economy growing again, my friends across the aisle, many of them, 
spent last night--all night--talking about climate change. That is 
right, climate change.
  So the message to millions of people out of work or who have lost 
their health coverage or to people who are living from paycheck to 
paycheck because median household income has actually declined is that 
what America really needs right now is more taxes and more regulation 
and the big government that goes along with it.
  It is easy to see why many people think Washington is just out of 
touch with the concerns of average hardworking American families, and 
last night was an example. It is hard to square the message with the 
genuine concern for the middle class and middle-class prosperity. I 
mean, if we are really concerned about hardworking American families 
working from paycheck to paycheck just to make ends meet, I doubt we 
would have an all-night debate on climate change.
  If my friends across the aisle really did believe that job creation 
should be our top priority, they wouldn't have wasted precious time 
with last night's political stunt. For that matter, they wouldn't be 
opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would single-handedly create 
thousands of well-paying American jobs.
  I realize that many people have good-faith concerns about the long-
term implications of rising greenhouse gas emissions. Over the next 
three decades worldwide emissions are indeed projected to surge. But 
that has almost nothing to do with the United States and almost 
everything to do with developing countries such as China. As a matter 
of fact, the ranking member of the energy committee, the Senator from 
Alaska, and certainly the Senator from Wyoming know this very well. One 
of the reasons why carbon emissions in the United States are going down 
is because of the natural gas renaissance we have seen--because of 
unconventional shale gas exploration in places such as Texas and all 
around the country. So we are finding ways to reduce carbon emissions 
for those who are worried about those, as a result of taking advantage 
of the resources we have here in the United States, together with the 
innovative technology that is used to develop it.
  Those of us who oppose bigger, more intrusive government in the form 
of cap and trade legislation or higher taxes such as carbon taxes or 
other job-killing greenhouse gas regulations are not denialists. I 
prefer to say we are realists.
  We understand America's contributions to global emissions over the 
coming decades will be relatively minuscule. We understand the economic 
costs of President Obama's regulations through the Environmental 
Protection Agency would vastly outweigh the environmental benefit.
  So why do they want to put a big wet blanket on the economy and on 
the aspirations and dreams of hard-working families in order to pursue 
policies in which the negative will vastly outweigh the positive 
benefit to American families?
  In fact, the Obama EPA itself has admitted its proposed greenhouse 
gas rule would not have a notable impact on U.S. carbon dioxide 
emissions until the year 2022.
  I would also note, despite having Members of his party talk about 
climate change all night--which is all it was, talk--there is no 
legislation they are offering, nor will the majority leader, who 
controls the agenda of the Senate, bring legislation to the floor to 
actually vote on it. So it is just talk or, perhaps I can say, it was 
just a lot of hot air.
  Our colleagues across the aisle--including the majority leader who 
controls the agenda of the floor in the Senate--seem to be content 
letting the President use his pen and phone, skirting the legislative 
process, not engaging with Congress to try to do things which actually 
are the priorities of the American people but instead to rely on 
unelected EPA bureaucrats. I could be surprised, but I would be 
surprised to learn if the consensus in America wouldn't be that we 
should be focusing on policies which create jobs, rather than destroy 
jobs and punish families in return for meager or nonexistent benefits.
  Speaking of destroying jobs and punishing families, the Congressional 
Budget Office--which is the official budgetary scorekeeper for 
Congress--recently estimated the President's proposal to raise the 
minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would actually destroy up to 1 million 
jobs.
  I believe sometimes here in Washington people think those who 
actually create jobs can absorb regulations, taxes, and other economic 
burdens, together with the uncertainty many of those policies cause, 
and it will have no impact on their ability to continue to create jobs, 
grow jobs or to grow the economy. But the Congressional Budget Office 
has stated what should perhaps be intuitive, which is, if you raise the 
cost of doing business on businesses, they are going to have to find 
someplace to cut.
  What that means is they are going to have to cut more people from 
their jobs. They estimated up to 1 million people would lose their job 
if we raised

[[Page S1496]]

the minimum wage 40 percent to $10.10 an hour.
  Remember, in the President's State of the Union Message he said a 
minimum wage hike like that would help low-income families. It is 
certainly a mystery to me how it would help a low-income family who is 
relying on a wage earner to provide income when they end up losing 
their job as a result of the policy.
  So the President's definition of ``help'' is unique, to say the 
least, because any policy which destroys up to 1 million jobs would be 
an absolute disaster for low-income families.
  The President also made his pitch for a higher minimum wage in the 
context of his concern about income inequality. He claims to be greatly 
concerned about income inequality. Yet his policies actually threaten 
to make it worse.
  But don't take my word for it. A news report from a major labor union 
argues that in its current form, the President's health care law will 
``heighten the inequality that the administration seeks to produce.''
  These are not political adversaries of our President and his party. 
These are supporters of the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--who have 
now said in its current form, unless changed, the Affordable Care Act--
or ObamaCare--will heighten the inequality the administration seeks to 
reduce.
  The report also notes that ObamaCare ``threatens the middle class 
with higher premiums, loss of hours, and a shift from part-time work 
and less comprehensive coverage.''
  I think those would be very troubling words to the President and his 
allies who passed the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare--but so far 
they have fallen on deaf ears.
  Again, this report just in terms of its credibility was not issued by 
some Republican or conservative organization which was opposed to 
ObamaCare from the beginning. It was issued by a labor union which 
supported ObamaCare which has now found that what was promised has not 
actually been delivered in terms of its implication.
  So what union members and their families are learning the hard way is 
the promise of ObamaCare is very different from the reality. We were 
promised ObamaCare would actually expand coverage, it would reduce 
costs, it would help our economy, all without disrupting existing 
health care arrangements.
  In reality, the law has forced millions to lose their coverage and 
forced millions to pay higher premiums or higher deductibles, 
effectively being self-insured. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget 
Office projects it will effectively shrink America's labor force by 2.5 
million full-time workers over the next decade.
  Remarkably, the administration now wants us to believe it is actually 
a good thing so many people are reducing their work hours in order to 
keep their government-mandated health care. For example, chief White 
House economist Jason Furman has said working less to keep ObamaCare 
benefits ``might be a better choice and a better option than what they 
had before.''
  Of course, they don't have a choice to keep what they had before 
because they have been forced into ObamaCare. If you don't buy the 
government-mandated insurance, then you are going to be fined by your 
friendly Federal Government.
  But think about it: The White House chief economist is celebrating 
the possibility of a dramatic decline in American work hours. I would 
remind Mr. Furman that America's labor force participation is already 
at historic lows. It is as low as it has been for 30 years. In other 
words, the percentage of people looking for work in America is at a 30-
year low already, and Mr. Furman is celebrating the further depressing 
impact of ObamaCare on work in America.
  All else being equal, a reduction in work hours means a reduction in 
economic growth. It certainly means a reduction in income for the 
people working. We know a further reduction of economic growth will 
make it harder to create new jobs, improve living standards, and 
achieve broad-based prosperity--something I know we all hope for in 
America.
  This is a dangerous cycle, and it is definitely not something we 
should be celebrating. It is something we should be fixing.
  A truly compassionate agenda--not one that focuses on things which 
are largely irrelevant to the lives of Americans working families, but 
a truly compassionate agenda would seek to improve opportunity rather 
than encourage dependency. A truly compassionate agenda would place a 
much higher value on the dignity and self-reliance of American workers 
by making sure they have jobs.
  For that matter, a truly compassionate agenda would aim to dismantle 
ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered alternatives which 
encourage work and encourage job creation.
  The type of agenda I have described is pretty much the exact opposite 
of what we have seen over the last 5 years, and the results speak for 
themselves. There is absolutely no reason we have to accept the status 
quo. With the right mix of economic policies, America can turn this 
ship around and restore the strong growth rates and robust job creation 
we enjoyed in the 1980s and 1990s. We will on this side of the aisle 
continue to promote such policies, and we look forward to working with 
our colleagues across the aisle when they finally come around to the 
realization the path we are heading on now is not one the American 
people are happy with or that they have to settle for.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. BLUNT. It has been less than 6 weeks since the President's health 
care initiative, the Affordable Care Act, was launched. The Web site is 
still not working, but the Web site will work. Actually, the Web site 
will be the easiest thing, in my view, that the administration will 
deal with as they try to solve the problems created by the act itself 
and, frankly, then the problems that were created by the Web site not 
working when we started.
  What we see happening already in these 6 weeks is that families are 
losing their current health care coverage, and certainly the cost, in 
example after example from my State of Missouri and across the country, 
appears to be going up at substantial levels for many families. A few 
families are lucky enough that they don't have much additional cost but 
not very many. A lot of families are simply losing the coverage they 
have had even though the President said, as we all have been reminded 
over and over in recent days: If you like your health care plan, you 
can keep your health care plan.
  Apparently, there are a whole lot of caveats on that that weren't 
said at the time, because people aren't able to keep their health care 
plan. The Associated Press reported that at least 3.5 million people 
have received cancellation notices. I heard somebody at the White House 
the other day say: These individual policies, that is only about 5 
percent of all the people in the country. Five percent of all of the 
people in the country are millions and millions of people. Even if 
there weren't millions of people, if someone is one of the 3.5 million 
families who were recently told their health care policy was 
cancelled--100 percent of their health care policies were cancelled 
because they don't have one right now--or at least they were told they 
won't have one sometime between now and the end of the year.
  As millions of people are losing their plans, we find out that only a 
few thousand people are signed up. Reports apparently show that fewer 
than 50,000 people have been able to successfully get through this 
system in 6 weeks, a period where the estimate was 500,000 people. So 
far we have 50,000 people signing up, not 500,000 people. We have 
millions of people losing their plans, even though everybody was told 
that if they like their plan, they will be able to keep their plan.
  It is estimated now that 7 million people were expected to get 
coverage by the end of March. Nobody, any longer, thinks that is a 
number that will come anywhere close to being achieved.
  The American people, obviously, would like the President to figure 
out how to live up to the promise that people can keep the health care 
they have if they like it. A lot of people are weighing in.
  President Clinton, in the last day or so, says we ought to figure out 
a way to keep the promise. This is not a real reach. This was not a 
promise made only one time and accidentally stated, this was a promise 
stated over and over again: If you like your health care plan, you can 
keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
  We are finding that is not true. Whether it is President Clinton who 
said we should figure out how to keep that promise, or there are all 
kinds of bills being filed in both the House and the Senate that would 
keep the promise, what I think we are going to find out is there are 
many promises in the Affordable Care Act that aren't going to be kept.
  We already know this has a workplace impact that is not good. People 
are going from full time to part time. People are trying to keep their 
employee numbers under 50 so they don't have to comply with the law. I 
have heard from many Missourians who have seen their hours reduced, 
seen their health care premiums rise, seen their options of insurance 
limited and their policies being cancelled. They deserve to have the 
people who made this pledge now keep this pledge.
  Congressional Democrats voted for the law. And there are very few 
laws one could say congressional Democrats voted for the law. This is a 
law that not a single Republican in the House or the Senate supported.
  There were many alternatives available. High-risk pools would work 
better, medical liability reform, expanding the marketplace where one 
could buy across State lines, more reporting by healthcare providers of 
what they charge and what their results are.
  The idea that there were no other options, which is widely repeated--
that the people who don't want to follow the Affordable Care Act don't 
want to do anything--is simply not true. When I was a Member of the 
House of Representatives, I filed a handful of bills, none of which 
were more than 75 pages long, that would deal with these rifleshot 
things that would have made the best health care system in the world 
better. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best health care system in 
the world, and I think we are in danger of losing that.
  The President promised: If you like your doctor, you can keep your 
doctor. Over and over again, that is not the case. The largest insurer 
on the Missouri exchange, on the exchange that Missouri voters have 
access to, doesn't include the largest hospital system. That means 
thousands of patients won't be able to see the doctors or to go to the 
13 hospitals of the largest health care system from the company that 
was their likely provider. This was the largest insurer--and as of this 
moment, the largest insurer in our State, the largest health care 
system--not part of their plan. Your insurance company, hospital, long-
time doctor, all should be your choice, not the choice of some 
government-dictated health care plan. With only one other insurer 
selling policies in the region where this big hospital system is, 
people aren't going to be able to go there.
  Many States have this same problem. Many States have options that 
don't include many of their hospitals or many of their health care 
providers.
  People are beginning to look at this and not only be concerned about 
a violated pledge, but being concerned about somebody besides them 
interfering with a long-term relationship with the hospital people go 
to and the doctor they see. Patients across the country are seeing and 
are likely to continue to see narrower and narrower networks available 
to them as insurers will try to keep costs down.
  With all of the new mandates in the law, one of the things they can 
control is they can negotiate with the people who would be available to 
see patients under their plan. That is obviously what has happened.
  Smaller networks can require patients to travel farther. People are 
driving by the doctor's office that they went to for years to get to 
the doctor they now have to go to. People are passing by the hospital 
that their family may have gone to for generations to get to the 
hospital that now is the only hospital available in their area, 
available under the exchange. This is going to become the routine for 
Americans who aren't going to be able to keep the insurance they like. 
They are not going to be able to keep the doctor they like, and in many 
cases they won't be able to go to the hospital they like.
  Last week I told stories of several Missourians who had preexisting 
conditions and are going to lose those policies when the Missouri high-
risk pool goes out of existence.
  Another thing we suggested in 2009 was to look for ways to expand the 
high-risk pools and make them work even better. They were working 
pretty well. The problem was there was always a waiting list to get 
into the high-risk pool. This was a way to deal with preexisting 
conditions. In a State such as ours where 4,300 people are in the high-
risk pool, they pay about 135 percent of the normal premium. That is a 
little more than the normal premium, but they are getting insurance 
after they got sick. This is a high-risk

[[Page S7970]]

pool where that has to work, 135 percent. For somebody who didn't have 
insurance until they got sick or lost their insurance after they got 
sick, that was probably a whole lot better than they are going to do 
right now. They are finding out it is a whole lot better than they are 
going to do right now.
  One of the stories we received this week was from Pam in Oronogo, MO, 
just outside of Joplin. Pam says her oldest son Aaron was born with a 
medical condition where there was a buildup of fluid inside his skull. 
He had his first shunt surgery at age 18 months. Her family has a 
family business and held onto their insurance through the business as 
long as they could, because they knew that no one would insure Aaron if 
they lost their insurance. That is obviously not a reason we would want 
to see perpetuated.
  Aaron, however, was ready to go to the high-risk pool. After 10 
years, their premiums had increased to $2,000 a month with a $10,000 
deductible. They were able to get Aaron in the high-risk pool and they 
were reasonably comfortable with that.
  With the elimination of the high-risk pool--all of which close 
December 31 in every State in the country--Pam and her family have to 
go to the exchange for Aaron. The exchange has to take Aaron, because 
he can get into the exchange.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.
  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. BLUNT. He can get into the exchange even if he had a preexisting 
condition. What they found in the exchange is Aaron can no longer use 
his neurosurgeon from Kansas City, the surgeon he has used for years 
now. They can't buy a catastrophic policy that would allow them to have 
some choice and pay some upfront costs on their own so they could have 
the doctor they are comfortable with. This is where they are. The 
insurance they had has gone away. The insurance they have doesn't allow 
them to see the doctor this young man has seen for years with a 
condition he has had his whole life.
  The President also promised that premiums would decrease, and that is 
clearly not the case.
  I look forward to Missourians continuing to let us know the 
challenges they are having. I look forward to being able to share those 
on the floor of the Senate in the next few weeks.
  One of my constituents from Independence discovered when his wife 
came home, their policy which has been costing $500 a month now is 
going to cost $1,100 a month. She is the office manager of an office 
with about 20 employees. Their insurance more than doubled.
  Unfortunately, these aren't the only cases I could talk about today. 
They are not nearly as limited as we would hope they would be. People 
are finding out that the Affordable Care Act that wasn't good for the 
workplace is now turning out to be not very good for health care.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have to return to the business at hand. 
Since the moment President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, making 
it the law of the land and ensuring every American has access to 
quality health insurance at a price they can afford, Republicans have 
been on an absurd quest to undo this progress.
  Republican Members of Congress were horrified when the U.S. Supreme 
Court said the law we call ``ObamaCare''--the Affordable Care Act--is 
constitutional. That is what the Supreme Court said. In spite of this 
being the law of the land--and it is the law of the land--House 
Republicans alone have voted more than 40 times to repeal ObamaCare and 
are now threatening to shut down the entire government unless this 
Congress denies funding to implement this very constitutional law.
  Under ObamaCare, Members of Congress and their staffs will be covered 
by exactly the same plans that will extend health insurance to millions 
of Americans next year. Five hundred thirty-five Members of Congress 
and 16,000 staff members are treated the same as other employees across 
America under the law. They are treated that way under ObamaCare, and 
rightfully so. Just as 150 million other Americans who get their health 
insurance through their jobs; that is, their employer, the Federal 
Government will share a part of the cost of that health care for us, 
for the 16,000 who work in the Capitol complex--as it has for all 
Federal employees for many decades. These are the people in Carson 
City, NV, Reno, NV, and Las Vegas, NV, who answer the phones and help 
people with problems involving Social Security, veterans' benefits, 
whether they can be buried at the beautiful cemetery we have in Fernley 
for veterans or the one in Boulder City where every day we bury lots 
and lots of people who are veterans.
  These are the sorts of inquiries we get around the State of Nevada, 
and people work long hard hours to respond to those requests. They are 
dedicated public servants. That is to whom the junior Senator from 
Louisiana said, No thanks; they are not entitled to anything as far as 
being treated as everybody else is treated.
  Even more directly to the point, Members of Congress and our staffs 
will live by the same rules and get their health care from the same 
exchanges as other Americans. But the junior Senator from Louisiana, I 
repeat, and a number of other misguided Republicans want to force 
Members of Congress and their staffs to live by a different set of 
rules. Although Senator Vitter has happily allowed the Federal 
Government to pay for a portion of his health insurance for many years 
as a Member of the House of Representatives and as a Member of the 
Senate, now he wants these 16,000 congressional workers to cover the 
full cost of health insurance.
  With this background, one must ask: If Senator Vitter opposes the 
employer contribution for congressional staffers, does he oppose it 
also for the 150 million other Americans whose employers help pay their 
health insurance premiums? Does he want to discourage private employers 
from doing the right thing and providing their employees with 
affordable health insurance coverage? Is it what he wants, to do away 
with the insurance 150 million Americans have in America? Millions, I 
repeat, millions and millions of employers rely on this important 
benefit to attract the best and brightest and hardest working people 
they can find. Ending the employer contribution would effectively slap 
150 million Americans with a big pay cut. Is that Senator Vitter's 
intention?
  If Republican Senators believe they should bear the full cost of 
their own health insurance, they can, without any change in the law, 
decline Federal Government support in contributions and pay their own 
way. They can even encourage their own staffs to do so. Why they would 
want to do that, I don't understand, but they could do it. But for 
Senator Vitter and his Republican allies to end the contribution for 
16,000 hard-working Federal employees--even after years of accepting 
the subsidy themselves--is hypocritical and mean-spirited.
  In truth, this is only the latest Republican aim to derail the 
successful implementation of ObamaCare. Last November there was a big 
poll taken--it is called an election--where Americans overwhelmingly 
voted to reelect President Obama and to keep ObamaCare as the law of 
the land. That was the issue of the campaign. Who won that? The 
American people won, and President Obama won. As for ObamaCare--the 
constitutional law of the land--the American people said, Let's go 
ahead and do it. Americans have spoken very loudly and very clearly. It 
is time to move on to something else. It is the law and has been.
  On October 1, about 25 million Americans who have no health insurance 
will--for the first time, most of them in their entire lifetime--be 
able to get insurance. What we have found in New York alone is that the 
insurance is going to save 50 percent of what it did before--it is 50 
percent cheaper. In Nevada it is cheaper. It is the way it is all over 
the country.
  According to the voters and according to the Supreme Court of the 
United States of America, ObamaCare is the law of the land. It is time 
for Republicans to mature--I guess you could say it a different way: to 
grow up--and recognize this is the law in America and has been for 
years. It is time for Republicans to stop denying reality.
  The Senate should be passing other legislation. We should be passing 
an energy efficiency bill that will save taxpayers money, creating 
good-paying jobs--we need that--rebuilding roads and bridges. I have 
said here before 70,000 bridges are in a state of disrepair. Yesterday 
a report came out that 8,000 of them are near collapse--8,000. We are 
not spending money to take care of that problem. Our highways, our 
roads, our dams need money. This is not money that goes to the Federal 
Government so you can have a truck that says: Federal Government 
building a road or fixing a dam. The money goes to the private sector. 
That is what we should be doing. For every $1 billion we spend doing 
something about the highways, bridges, roads, dams, water systems, 
sewer systems, we create 47,500 high-paying jobs, and thousands of 
other jobs spin off from that. That is what we should be doing.
  We should be facing the reality of climate change. Look what happened 
in Colorado. I talked to Senator Bennet yesterday. He said the floods 
were Biblical. In one part of Colorado, it rained 12 inches in 2 hours. 
I cannot imagine that. Fires all over the West. Climate change is here. 
I met with the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh. They do not know what 
they are going to do with the rise of the sea which is taking place. In 
that country there is no high ground. It is that way all over the

[[Page S6479]]

world. The Marshall Islands--a thousand islands make up the Marshall 
Islands--55,000 people live there. These islands are being washed away 
with the new waves they have never seen before.
  Climate change is here. We are doing nothing about it. They are 
spending all of our time, the American taxpayers' time, trying to 
repeal a law that has been in effect for 4 years.
  We should be doing something about immigration reform. They talk 
about wanting to do something for the economy. Try passing immigration 
reform. It creates to the positive $1 trillion. It would reduce our 
debt by $1 trillion. Let's do that. Let's fix our broken tax system.
  We should be doing those things, not relitigating 4-year-old policy 
battles. But instead of working with Democrats to effectively implement 
ObamaCare or to pass new laws that benefit middle-class families, 
Republicans are obsessed with fighting a real old battle, and they are 
doing it at taxpayer expense.
  Instead of standing with millions of Americans who are already 
benefiting from ObamaCare, Republicans are standing with insurance 
companies that would return us to a time when profits came before 
people. That is the way it works.
  Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, 
insurance companies can no longer discriminate against children with 
preexisting conditions. That is a good deal. If you have a child with 
diabetes, that boy or girl cannot be denied insurance. If they have 
epilepsy, they cannot be denied insurance. And in a short few months 
all Americans will no longer be able to be denied insurance coverage 
because of a preexisting illness. They can no longer raise your rates 
for no reason. They can no longer drop your coverage if you get sick. 
That is the law today.
  Today children can no longer be denied insurance, as I have 
indicated, because they are born with a disease or a disability. And 
that, I repeat, will soon be extended to all Americans no matter their 
age. And listen to this one: Very soon being a woman will no longer be 
considered a preexisting condition, as it was before ObamaCare passed.
  In my relatively sparsely populated State of Nevada, tens of 
thousands of seniors have saved tens of millions of dollars on 
medicines because the Affordable Care Act has helped close the gap on 
prescription drug coverage.
  More than 3 million young people, including 33,000 young Nevadans, 
have been able to stay on their parents' health policies until they are 
26 years old--3 million. Hundreds of thousands of businesses that 
already offer their employees health insurance are getting tax credits 
for doing the right thing.
  In a few months almost 130 million Americans with preexisting 
conditions--and what are some of these preexisting conditions; I talked 
about it generally a minute ago: high blood pressure, all kinds of 
things that happen as you get older--will have access to reasonably 
priced coverage, no matter their high blood pressure or their heart 
condition or whatever the situation might be. And 25 million Americans 
who cannot afford health insurance today will be offered health 
insurance through the exchanges.
  Republicans have been trying for years to erase these gains and force 
millions of American families once again to rely on the most expensive 
care in America today, which is where? It is emergency rooms. Hospitals 
hate it because their bad debt goes up, and all it does is drive up the 
cost of insurance. The care is not as good as it would be if they could 
go when they first get sick. They go there out of desperation, and that 
is what I assume the Republicans want everyone to do. Everyone can go 
to an emergency room, but it is so expensive and does not do the trick.
  So punishing hard-working congressional staff, who put in long hours 
because they believe in public service--that is, the work we do here in 
Congress--will not roll back the benefits of ObamaCare. Punishing 
congressional staffers will not prevent millions of Americans from 
gaining the health insurance they need and deserve next year. But it 
will hurt thousands of men and women, including Senator Vitter's 
colleagues and his own staff.
  Instead of willfully denying that ObamaCare is the law or purposely 
trying to derail its implementation, it is time for Senator Vitter to 
help us improve the law of the land and ensure every American has 
access to the kind of care Members of Congress enjoy already, as do 150 
million other Americans who get health care through their employers.

                        AMERICAN WOMEN'S HEALTH

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, this week marks the second anniversary of the 
Affordable Care Act, legislation that makes quality health care more 
affordable for everyone. March is also Women's History Month, so I 
would like to talk about how this act affects women's health.
  Instead of just imposing government mandates on health care for 
women, I believe the Affordable Care Act empowers women and their 
families because the Affordable Care Act bans insurance companies from 
requiring women to obtain authorization before getting OB/GYN care. The 
Affordable Care Act keeps insurance companies from denying coverage for 
conditions such as breast or cervical cancer, pregnancy, having had a 
C-section, or being the victim of domestic violence; and it ends the 
practice of gender rating, so women will no longer be charged higher 
rates for simply being a woman.

[[Page H1399]]

  The Affordable Care Act does all of this while preserving Americans' 
right to choose their own doctor and the health coverage that they 
want. Women's health, Americans' health is better because of the 
Affordable Care Act.

            SUPPORTING THE REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2--legislation 
to repeal the so-called Affordable Care Act--a new effort to strengthen 
our health care system.
  This will be the first step in ensuring that the American people will 
remain in control of their own health care through a system that is 
patient-centered and provides health care choices, not government-
imposed mandates.
  Many people question why we are doing this. They ask, Why repeal the 
new health care law if there are good provisions in it?
  Well, there may be some aspects of the 3,000-page bill, which is now 
law, that were commendable 10 months ago. However, those few positive 
provisions do not outweigh the fact that the new law's most damaging 
aspect is that it turns over to the Federal Government individuals' 
rights to make their own health care choices for themselves and for 
their families. The new law has given Washington bureaucrats 
extraordinary power to control the health care decisions of all 
Americans:
  Forcing us to buy health insurance that Washington deems to be 
acceptable; potentially fining us for refusing to do so, which I 
believe would be unconstitutional; determining our choices of doctors, 
hospitals and home care; deciding which medicines we can take and which 
medical procedures will be available to our families; putting one-sixth 
of our economy under government control.
  Let me be clear. I support health care reform. However, I do not 
support this new health care law, which represents, to a very great 
extent, a Washington takeover of our health care system. This law is 
creating over 150 new boards, bureaus, committees, commissions, 
offices, pilot programs, working groups, and agencies which will issue 
onerous regulations that will change our health care system forever--
and not for the better.
  Remember, over 90 percent of Americans have health coverage for 
themselves and for their families. Why did the last Congress insist on 
a virtual takeover of the other 10 percent?
  That is why I support the repeal, coupled with major changes to 
assist those who do not have coverage, without harming the plans of 
hundreds of millions of Americans who do.
  My colleagues, why is this repeal necessary today?
  Because the negative effects of this new law are already being felt 
and are threatening the practice of medicine as we know it. This new 
law has eroded your right to choose your health care and your doctors, 
and it is putting bureaucrats and politicians in charge.
  Despite predictions from the White House, insurance premiums are not 
going down. To the contrary, premiums are rising across the Nation for 
people who have insurance as insurance companies struggle to pay for 
the costs of a raft of new mandates imposed by Washington.
  Even as we speak, doctors are changing their practices because this 
new law discourages their ability to work as single practitioners or in 
group practice. In addition, doctors face more paperwork, more red 
tape, and more risk to their licenses to practice.

                              {time}  1940

  Furthermore, the new law does nothing to solve or diminish the wave 
of junk medical lawsuits that force doctors, medical professions, and 
hospitals to practice expensive defensive medicine.
  Also missing from the law is any program to promote and support 
medical education in America, the next generation of young people who 
we will count on for care. At the same time, doctors and hospitals will 
face reduced Medicare reimbursements and even more onerous Medicare 
rules and regulations, causing even more physicians to refuse to treat 
senior citizens.
  And what about the promises we heard about the benefits of the new 
law? To protect Americans from being denied coverage due to preexisting 
or other conditions, 27 States have created their own high-risk 
insurance pools. Others have used an option in the law to let their 
residents buy coverage through a new Federal health plan. Last spring, 
Medicare's chief actuary predicted that 375,000 people would sign up 
for one of these special plans by the end of 2010. In fact, the 
Department of Health and Human Services reported last month that just 
over 8,000 people had enrolled. This difference of 367,000 enrollees 
raises real questions about the then-majority's demand for this 
provision.
  And with claims to provide coverage for another 34 million Americans, 
we need to be reminded that 18 million of these newly insured people 
will gain coverage through the financially stressed Medicaid program, 
which is almost broke. My colleagues, current Medicaid enrollees are 
already having trouble finding doctors who will see them because of low 
reimbursement rates. This law proposes to add another 18 million 
patients to a struggling and absolutely necessary program.
  In addition, our hospitals are already reeling. Passage of the new 
health care law has accelerated the layoff of hundreds of employees in 
hospitals in my congressional district. When further Medicare cuts take 
hold, how are these institutions going to maintain their quality of 
care? They aren't.
  And what of the advertised benefits of the new health care law? 
Backers actually claimed the new law would reduce the Federal deficit. 
This claim is based on dubious economic assumptions, double counting, 
and other budget gimmickry. And it is astounding that this law counts 
10 years of anticipated revenues to offset 6 years of new spending. 
Here's a simple fact: If ObamaCare is fully implemented, it will not 
cut the deficit. The law will actually add more than $700 billion to 
the deficit in its first 10 years.

[[Page H238]]

  And what about jobs? Our first priority should be creating private 
sector employment opportunities, especially in America's small 
businesses.
  However, the evidence is clear: by raising taxes, imposing new health 
mandates and regulations, and increasing uncertainty for small business 
employers, investors and entrepreneurs, ObamaCare is already destroying 
jobs in our country.
  With nearly 10 percent unemployment and massive public debt, the 
American people want us to focus on cutting spending and expanding our 
economy.
  That's why I will urge my Colleagues to support this important repeal 
legislation and take the first steps towards replacing it with reforms 
that will bring down costs, expand health care accessibility and 
protect American jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, this week we have the opportunity to ensure that our 
constituents remain in control of their own health care through a 
system that is patient-centered and provides health care choices, not 
Washington-imposed mandates.
  I urge support of H.R. 2--the repeal of Obamacare.

                      AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind Americans today to hurry: 
they have 6 days left to sign up for the Affordable Care Act through 
their Federal and State exchanges and marketplaces. Don't believe the 
hype from the Republicans. The Affordable Care Act is working to 
improve the lives of millions of Americans. More than 5 million 
Americans have signed up so far through the marketplace, and they will 
continue to do so.
  This weekend, I hosted two enrollment events in my district, both in 
Dallas and Fort Worth, and attended two additional ones to ensure that 
constituents in my district get the affordable health care they 
deserve. What I saw when I visited those events were rooms filled with 
men, women, and children looking to provide insurance for their 
families, looking to ensure that they are protected from unforeseen 
sickness and health issues.
  Let's stop playing politics with people's health care. Let's work 
together to get every American covered.

         THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ALAN GRAYSON

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 13, 2010

  Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Speaker, the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act of 2010 is a triumph for American consumers of health 
insurance and health care. When fully implemented, it will extend 
health care insurance to 32 million uninsured Americans, covering 95 
percent of American citizens and legal residents. It will extend 
premium affordability tax credits to 20 million Americans and help 4 
million small businesses provide health insurance for their workers. By 
the end of this year it will end some of the worst insurance company 
abuses such as post-claims underwriting or lifetime limits on coverage. 
When fully implemented it will ban even more, including health status 
underwriting and exclusions of pre-existing conditions. This 
legislation will ``bend the curve'' in the unsustainable growth in 
health care costs while improving the quality of American health care. 
It encourages wellness and prevention and will help Americans become 
among the best informed health insurance consumers in the world.
  Such sweeping legislation cannot explicitly address every issue that 
will arise under its provisions. In the near term, the legislation must 
be implemented through regulations promulgated by the federal executive 
agencies--in particular Health and Human Services, Labor, and 
Treasury--and by the states. Ultimately, the courts may need to 
interpret some of the provisions of the statute.
  It is important, therefore, to set down the intention of Congress as 
to the principles of construction that should be applied in 
implementing and interpreting the law. The first and foremost of these 
is captured in the title of the bill. This legislation should always be 
construed to protect patients and to make health insurance and health 
care more affordable for consumers. Whenever the bill is silent or 
ambiguous on a particular issue it should be construed by a federal or 
state agency or court to accomplish this goal.
  Many of the provisions of this bill, including the premium tax 
credits and cost-sharing assistance, the individual and employer 
responsibility provisions, and the Medicare and Medicaid reforms and 
expansions, must be implemented by the federal agencies. In drafting 
regulations, the agencies must first and foremost attend to the 
interests of patients, consumers, and beneficiaries. Many other 
provisions will ultimately be implemented by the states. The general 
interpretive principle of the insurance reform legislation in relation 
to the states is found in section 1321(d), which states ``Nothing in 
this title shall be construed to preempt any State law that does not 
prevent the application of the provisions of this title.'' In other 
words, state laws more protective of consumers are preserved; state 
laws less protective of consumers are preempted.
  Several issues raised by the legislation illustrate the application 
of these principles. First, nowhere does section 2719, which prescribes 
internal and external review procedures that insurance plans must 
follow when consumers appeal coverage determinations, explicitly state 
that all state and federal judicial remedies remain available if an 
appeal is denied both internally and externally. Every state, however, 
provides for judicial review of insurance claims denials in the 
nongroup market and 29 U.S.C. sec. 1132 offers judicial review of group 
health claims. These remedies are not expressly displaced by the law, 
and it is the intention of Congress that they continue to be available 
to aggrieved consumers.
  Second, grandfathering of insurance plans that pre-date the 
legislation is not forever. A principle announced repeatedly by the 
President throughout the debate was that ``if you like the insurance 
coverage you have, you can keep it.'' Congress never intended, however, 
that if you had insurance coverage you did not like, you would be stuck 
with it forever. Section 1251 of the PPACA, therefore, should not be 
interpreted to mean that an insured who is enrolled in a group health 
plan will never be extended the consumer protections found in the 
legislation. If coverage under the plan changes significantly, for 
example through increased cost-sharing for members, the plan's 
grandfathered status should be lost and the full protections of the 
legislation apply.
  Third, the ban on pre-existing condition exclusions for children 
under sec. 10103(e) does not merely mean that plans cannot exclude pre-
existing conditions from coverage, but also that they cannot exclude 
children with pre-existing conditions from coverage. The law must be 
interpreted broadly to achieve its purposes, not narrowly to encourage 
evasion.
  Fourth, the provisions of sec. 2714 of the Public Health Services Act 
added by sec. 1001 of the PPACA extending coverage to adult children up 
to age 26 should be interpreted to require the extension of family 
coverage to cover adult children, not to permit insurers to separately 
underwrite such children or to require them to pay the full cost of 
adult coverage.
  Fifth, the provisions of sec. 1332 of the PPACA allowing state 
waivers for innovation are intended to provide maximum flexibility for 
the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services so long as the state plan is at least as comprehensive and 
affordable, and so long as it covers at least as many people as the law 
would provide otherwise.
  Finally, the provisions of sec. 715 of ERISA added by 1562 of the 
PPACA should be understood to fully extend all of the protections of 
the PPACA that apply to group health plans to all employment-related 
health plans, including self-insured plans. The law should also be 
understood to intend that the full authority of

[[Page E534]]

the Departments of Labor and Treasury in regulating and enforcing the 
law against ERISA plans is available to enforce the terms of the PPACA.
  These are only a few examples of many issues that will no doubt arise 
in implementing and interpreting the law. The general principles that 
they illustrate, however, must be applied throughout by the federal 
agencies, by the states, and by the courts. This law is intended to 
protect patients and consumers, and whenever it is silent or unclear, 
it must be construed toward these ends.

[Pages H8335-H8336]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the 
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, yesterday Virginia District Court Judge 
Henry Hudson's decision striking down one provision of the Affordable 
Care Act has generated a lot of noise in the last 24 hours.
  Opponents of health care reform are celebrating as if the whole law 
was struck down, even though Judge Hudson refused the Commonwealth of 
Virginia's request to strike down the entire law and Judge Hudson 
refused the Commonwealth of Virginia's request to stop implementation 
of the health care bill which has been proceeding since last March.
  Thank goodness the judge had enough common sense not to stop the 
health care bill's important protections for families and patients that 
have been implemented since last March, such as age 26 dependent 
coverage which employers all across America have been implementing 
since last July, giving families the opportunity to keep children 
covered on their family's health insurance plan up to age 26; such as 
protections like the elimination of insurance company rescissions of 
coverage, the practice of denying claims after the fact, many times 
after patients have had surgery or have had treatment; such as the $250 
payments, which seniors who fell into the part D doughnut hole received 
in 2010; such as the 50 percent discount for brand-name medications, 
which seniors in the doughnut hole will start to receive starting on 
January 1; such as the new Medicare coverage for annual checkups, 
cancer screenings, smoking cessation, vaccinations for flu, which the 
new health care bill will provide starting on January 1; such as the 
early retiree reinsurance program, which employers all across the 
country, private employers as well as public employers, are using to 
stabilize age 55 and up retirement health benefits, including 96 plans 
just in the Commonwealth of Virginia alone.
  For all the crowing and boasting by opponents of health care reform, 
there was less there than meets the eye. But there is no doubt that the 
judge did strike down an important part of the bill, namely, the shared 
responsibility provision, the requirement that nearly all Americans 
carry health insurance, a provision which two other district court 
judges, one in Virginia and one in Michigan, upheld as a proper 
exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.
  Judge Hudson ruled that this provision doesn't ``fit within the 
letter or spirit of the Constitution.'' Well, Madam Speaker, there is a 
long, long history of Supreme Court cases which have held exactly the 
opposite of what Judge Hudson wrote.
  Indeed, Antonin Scalia, the leader of conservative forces on the U.S. 
Supreme Court, himself, wrote that Congress has the authority to enact 
a regulation of interstate commerce, and it possesses every power 
needed to make that regulation effective.
  Using Justice Scalia's interpretation of the commerce clause, it is 
clear that this bill's provision to eliminate preexisting condition 
exclusion, the practice by insurance companies for denying coverage for 
people with cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic conditions, 
which require a pooling mechanism which the shared responsibility 
requirement was designed to accomplish, clearly fits within Justice 
Scalia's definition of the commerce clause. In fact, we know this from 
real-life experience.
  Seven States tried to enact a guaranteed issuance law requiring 
insurance companies to insure all people regardless of preexisting 
conditions, and what happened was that rates went through the roof. 
Only one State was able to implement a prohibition on preexisting 
condition exclusions, that was the State of Massachusetts, which was 
coupled with a shared responsibility mechanism. And, as a result, 
insurance premiums fell in the individual market by 42 percent.
  The impact on interstate commerce in terms of what is happening in 
the health insurance market could not be clearer. In fact, the trade 
organization representing America's health insurance industry back in 
2008, after the election, made it clear that a shared responsibility 
mandate requirement is essential to actually executing and performing 
real reform in the insurance market. Allowing people to enter the 
market and exit the market when they get sick and when they get better 
is like insuring a burning building. And the fact of the matter is that 
the judge's decision, despite the fact that conservative judges like 
Antonin Scalia have recognized Congress' ability to regulate interstate 
commerce, which the health insurance industry clearly falls under, 
would allow for the Congress to set up the real mechanism to make sure 
that its goal of eliminating preexisting conditions can actually take 
place. And the health insurance industry knows over the last 5 years 
the collapse that has been occurring within the marketplace because of 
rising premiums.
  I come from the State of Connecticut. We have Aetna, we have CIGNA, 
we have United Health Care. These are the largest plans in the country 
that are selling to employers, and they have seen the percentage of 
their coverage across America decline, not since the passage of the 
health care bill, but going back to 2005. And this measure is designed, 
in fact, really just to stabilize that private health insurance market.
  Madam Speaker, in a few short weeks, new Members of Congress are 
going to be sworn into office. They are going to be given a PIN that 
gets them into the building, they are going to be given a voting card, 
and they are also going to be given an opportunity to enroll in the 
Federal Employee Health Benefit plan, a purchasing exchange which 
Members of Congress can participate in, get a nice comprehensive 
package of benefits, taxpayer subsidies, affordable rates. And on page 
29 of this booklet, it makes it very clear that preexisting conditions 
will not be imposed against them.
  The people of this country deserve the same type of coverage. And it 
is my hope, as the appellate courts review that decision yesterday, 
that they will uphold the Affordable Care Act's provision to stabilize 
the private health insurance market.

 Health Plans Propose Guaranteed Coverage for Pre-Existing Conditions 
                    and Individual Coverage Mandate

       Washington, DC.--Health plans today proposed guaranteed 
     coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions in 
     conjunction with an enforceable individual coverage mandate.
       Under the new proposal, health plans participating in the 
     individual health insurance market would be required to offer 
     coverage to all applicants as part of a universal 
     participation plan in which all individuals were required to 
     maintain health insurance.
       Health plans also said that premium support for moderate-
     income individuals and broad spreading of risk was necessary 
     to promote affordability and maintain premium stability in 
     the individual health insurance market.
       To ensure that all Americans can access coverage, health 
     plans also reiterated their long-standing support for making 
     eligible for Medicaid every uninsured American living in 
     poverty and strengthening the Children's Health Insurance 
     Program.
       ``No one should fall through the cracks of our health care 
     system,'' said Karen Ignagni, President and CEO of America's 
     Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). ``Universal coverage is within 
     reach and can be achieved by building on the current 
     system.''
       The announcement follows a nationwide listening tour 
     conducted by AHIP as part of its Campaign for an American 
     Solution. Concerns about coverage for pre-existing 
     conditions, continuity of coverage for those between jobs and 
     maintaining affordability for those with insurance were 
     raised repeatedly across the country.

[[Page H8336]]

       ``AHIP's Board of Directors is responding to the concerns 
     of the American people by offering a workable solution to 
     ensure that no one is left out of the health care system 
     because of their health, age, income or employment status,'' 
     said Ignagni.
       The new proposal builds on the series of comprehensive 
     reform plans that AHIP's Board of Directors began releasing 
     in November 2006. Further reform proposals addressing the 
     affordability, accessibility and quality of health care are 
     anticipated in the weeks ahead.


   Summary of AHIP's Proposal to Guarantee Coverage for Pre-existing 
   Conditions and Promote Affordability in the Individual Insurance 
                                Market:

       Guarantee-issue coverage with no pre-existing condition 
     exclusions;
       Establish an individual coverage requirement with an 
     insurance coverage verification system, an automatic 
     enrollment process and effective enforcement of the 
     requirement that all individuals purchase and maintain 
     coverage;
       Promote affordability by: providing refundable, advanceable 
     tax credits for moderate-income individuals and working 
     families; and promoting tax equity whether coverage is 
     obtained through an employer or the individual market; and
       Ensure premium stability for those with existing coverage 
     through a broadly funded reimbursement mechanism that spreads 
     costs for the highest-risk individuals.


        Background on the Individual Market and Guarantee Issue

       AHIP's survey of the individual market shows that 
     individually purchased health insurance is far more 
     affordable and accessible than is widely known. The survey 
     found that 9 out of 10 applicants undergoing medical 
     underwriting were offered coverage. The plans commonly 
     purchased by consumers provided substantial financial 
     protection and a wide range of benefits, including coverage 
     for behavioral health, prescription drugs and preventive 
     services.
       Some individuals are unable to purchase individual health 
     insurance coverage in the private market because of their 
     health status. One approach taken by states to address this 
     issue has been the enactment of guarantee issue legislation 
     requiring health plans to offer coverage to all applicants. 
     These well-intentioned reforms have often resulted in severe 
     unintended consequences, including significantly higher costs 
     for all policyholders.
       A report by Milliman, Inc. found that enactment of 
     guarantee issue laws in the absence of requirement that 
     individuals purchase coverage may incentivize people to defer 
     seeking coverage until they have health problems--a situation 
     which unfairly penalizes those who are currently insured. 
     According to the report, states that implemented these laws 
     saw a rise in insurance premiums, a reduction of individual 
     insurance enrollment and no significant decrease in the 
     number of uninsured. To learn more about the individual 
     market survey and the Milliman report, please visit

               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the President signed into 
law today the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This bill 
included a provision that would extend Medicare wage index 
reclassifications for hospitals across more than half of the United 
States, including several in my home State.
  The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 included section 508 which 
reclassified many hospitals' Medicare wage index to appropriately 
reflect the wage index of their area. This provision ensures that 
hospitals are able to compete fairly in that area's labor market. Since 
the MMA was enacted, section 508 has been extended numerous times. Many 
hospitals, including some in Michigan, were left out of these 
subsequent extensions. Consequently, those hospitals, originally 
included in section 508, required technical corrections so they could 
continue to be reclassified along with the other original hospitals 
included in section 508. This is something that we have done in 
previous years and is nothing new. These technical fixes just ensure 
that the original intent of section 508 is maintained.
  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, we saw what I have 
called the dawn of a new day of hope for tens of millions of Americans 
who have fallen through the cracks--or who worry with good reason that 
they may fall through the cracks--of our broken health insurance 
system. The signing into law of comprehensive health insurance reform 
by President Barack Obama ranks with the creation of Social Security 
and Medicare as a defining moment and legislative achievement.
  Congress and Presidents from both parties tried to reform the health 
insurance system for decades. Through an arduous process over the last 
year, America rose to meet one of its foremost challenges. This effort 
prevailed through the grueling gauntlet of obstructionism erected by 
defenders of

[[Page S2013]]

the status quo. It took a year of debate, the work of numerous 
committees and both Chambers of Congress to enact health insurance 
reform and to begin to get a handle on costs by having Americans 
covered by health insurance.
  Now that comprehensive health insurance reform is the law of the 
land, the Senate is already working on improvements to this 
legislation. These include making coverage more affordable and creating 
a more equitable distribution of Medicaid reimbursements to States like 
Vermont that acted early and correctly on reform.
  Some are still in denial, and continue to resist the path to reform. 
Some in the Senate resist improvements to the aspects of the new law 
that they had previously criticized. They appear intent on voting 
against improvements and, in effect, in favor of the aspects of the law 
they had said raised concerns. Some opponents of reform continue to 
distort what this reform really means, and continue their misleading 
arguments and spurious attacks. Some appear to see political gain in 
trying to attack health care reform with lawsuits. This is an effort to 
have judges override the legislative decisions of Congress, the elected 
representatives of the American people. This is an effort to repeal 
through the courts what they cannot do in Congress. Regardless, health 
insurance reform is the law of the land.
  Every member of Congress takes an oath of office. Ours is to 
``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' I take 
this oath very seriously and always have. We took it seriously during 
the many months of open and public debate of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act last year. During Senate debate last December, as 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I responded to arguments 
about the constitutionality of the bill's requirement that individuals 
purchase health insurance. During that debate, the Senate rejected a 
purported constitutional point of order raised by Republicans claiming 
that the individual responsibility requirement was unconstitutional. 
The Senate's judgment and mine were that the act was constitutional.
  This week the President signed the measure into law. This President 
has studied the Constitution. He has served in the Senate. He has 
taught classes on constitutional law. The oath he took when he became 
President of the United States of America is provided in the 
Constitution. He swore that he would to the best of his ability 
``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' 
I know President Obama and know that he takes his oath seriously. I 
know that when he signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
into law, he understood it to be consistent with the Constitution.
  Despite the overheated rhetoric from opponents, the authority of 
Congress to act is well-established by the text and the spirit of the 
Constitution, by prior acts of Congress like Social Security and 
Medicare, by longstanding precedent established by our courts, and by 
the history of American democracy. These were arguments considered and 
rejected in congressional committees. They were arguments expressly 
considered by the Senate. Indeed the findings adopted and contained in 
the law itself are that the individual responsibility requirement is 
commercial and economic in nature, has a substantial effect on 
interstate commerce and is ``essential to creating effective health 
insurance markets.'' That is the congressional judgment.
  Ironically, the so-called individual mandate has long been a 
Republican proposal. The individual mandate was supported by the senior 
Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, when they opposed health care reform 
efforts during the Clinton administration. It was a part of the health 
care reform effort in Massachusetts supported by former Governor Mitt 
Romney, a Republican.
  This individual mandate did not originate with President Obama. In 
fact, when President Obama was a candidate, as a matter of policy he 
did not support the individual mandate requirement as part of his 
initial comprehensive health reform proposal. It was one of the 
hundreds of Republican health care reform ideas he came to support and 
that were included in the law as the bill was drafted, developed, 
debated and passed. Now that the law is enacted, some Republicans have 
changed their tune in order to undercut these reforms by suggesting 
that it is unconstitutional.
  Although the legislative record supports the constitutionality of the 
individual mandate, and expert after expert maintain that there is no 
question about congressional authority, I, again, recall what I set 
forth last December when the Senate considered this issue, made its 
findings and reached its determination.
  The Constitution of the United States begins with a preamble that 
sets forth the purposes for which ``We the People of the United 
States'' ordained and established it. Among the six purposes set forth 
by the Founders was that the Constitution was established to ``promote 
the general Welfare.'' It is hard to imagine an issue more fundamental 
to the general welfare of all Americans than their health.
  The authority and responsibility for taking actions to further this 
purpose is vested in Congress by article I of the Constitution. In 
particular article I, section 8, sets forth several of the core powers 
of Congress, including the ``general welfare clause,'' the ``commerce 
clause'' and the ``necessary and proper clause.'' These clauses form 
the basis for Congress's power, and include authority to reform health 
care by containing spiraling costs and ensuring its availability for 
all Americans.
  Any serious questions about congressional power to take comprehensive 
action to build and secure the social safety net have been settled over 
the past century. According to article I, section 8: ``The Congress 
shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, 
to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare 
of the United States.'' This clause has been the basis for actions by 
Congress to provide for Americans' social and economic security by 
passing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Those landmark laws 
provide the well-established foundation on which Congress builds with 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  As noted by Tom Schaller, enforcing the individual mandate 
requirement by a tax penalty is far from unprecedented, despite the 
claims of critics. Individuals pay for Social Security and Medicare, 
for example, by payroll taxes collected under the Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act, FICA. These FICA payments are typically collected as 
deductions and noted on Americans' paychecks every month. As Professor 
Schaller recently wrote: ``These are the two biggest government-
sponsored insurance programs administered by the [Federal Government], 
and two of the largest line items in the federal budget. These paycheck 
deductions are not optional, and for all but the self-employed they are 
taken out immediately.'' The individual mandate requirement in the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is hardly revolutionary when 
viewed against the background of Social Security and Medicare that have 
long required individual payments.
  Congress has woven America's social safety net over the last three 
score and 12 years. Congress's authority to use its judgment to promote 
the general welfare cannot now be in doubt. America and all Americans 
are the better for it. Growing old no longer means growing poor. Being 
older or poor no longer means being without medical care. These 
developments are all due to congressional action.
  The Supreme Court settled the debate on the constitutionality of 
Social Security more than 70 years ago in three 1937 decisions. In one 
of those decisions, Helvering v. Davis, Justice Cardozo wrote that the 
discretion to determine whether a matter impacts the general welfare 
``is not confided in the courts'' but falls ``within the wide range of 
discretion permitted to the Congress.'' Turning then to the ``nation-
wide calamity that began in 1929'' of unemployment spreading from state 
to state throughout the Nation, leaving older Americans without jobs 
and security, Justice Cardozo wrote of the Social Security Act: ``The 
hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of 
the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits 
them when journey's end is near.''
  The Supreme Court reached its decisions upholding Social Security 
after the first Justice Roberts--Justice

[[Page S2014]]

Owen Roberts in the exercise of good judgment and judicial restraint 
began voting to uphold the key New Deal legislation. He was not alone. 
It was Chief Justice Hughes who wrote the Supreme Court's opinion in 
West Coast Hotel v. Parrish upholding minimum wage requirements as 
reasonable regulation. The Supreme Court also upheld a Federal farm 
bankruptcy law, railroad labor legislation, a regulatory tax on 
firearms and the Wagner Act on labor relations in National Labor 
Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation. The Supreme 
Court abandoned its judicially-created veto over congressional action 
with which it disagreed on policy grounds and rightfully deferred to 
Congress's constitutional authority.
  These Supreme Court decisions and the principles underlying them are 
not in question. As Dean Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of 
California Irvine School of Law wrote in an op-ed in the Los Angeles 
Times: ``Congress has broad power to tax and spend for the general 
welfare. In the last 70 years, no federal taxing or spending program 
has been declared to exceed the scope of Congress' power. The ability 
in particular of Congress to tax people to spend money for health 
coverage has been long established with programs such as Medicare and 
Medicaid.'' I included this article in the Congressional Record in 
December.
  The opponents of health insurance reform are now going so far as to 
call into question the constitutionality of America's established 
social safety net. They would leave American workers without the 
protections their lifetime of hard work have earned them. They would 
turn back the clock to the hardships of the Great Depression, and 
thrust modern American back into the conditions of Dickens' novels. 
That path should be rejected again now, just as it was when another 
inspiring President led the effort to confront the economic challenges 
facing Americans 70 years ago. To strike down principles that have been 
settled for nearly three-quarters of a century would be wrong and 
damaging to the Nation, and would stand the Constitution on its head.
  For the past year we debated whether or not to pass health insurance 
reform. Before passing the law, we debated whether to control costs by 
having all Americans be covered by health insurance. We considered 
untold numbers of amendments in committees and before the Senate. That 
is what Congress is supposed to do. We consider legislation, debate it, 
vote on it and act in our best collective judgment to promote the 
general welfare. Some Senators agreed and some disagreed, but it was a 
matter decided by the full Senate. In fact, due to Republican 
obstruction, it took an extraordinary majority of 60 Senators, not a 
simple majority of 51, for the Senate's will to be done.
  The fact that Senate Republicans disagree with the majority's effort 
to help hardworking Americans obtain access to affordable health care 
does not make it unconstitutional. Nor does the fact that some 
partisans seek to make political gains by attacking the health care 
reform we have passed. As Justice Cardozo wrote in upholding Social 
Security: ``[W]hether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of 
benefits set forth . . . it is not for us to say. The answer to such 
inquiries must come from Congress, not the courts.'' I agree. Justice 
Cardozo understood the separation of powers enshrined in the 
Constitution and the Supreme Court's precedent.
  As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in his landmark decision in McCulloch 
v. Maryland: ``Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of 
the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are 
plainly adopted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consistent 
with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.'' 
In 1803, our greatest Chief Justice, John Marshall, upheld the 
constitutionality of the Judiciary Act in Stuart v. Laird, and noted 
that ``there are no words in the Constitution to prohibit or restrain 
the exercise of legislation power.'' That is true here, where Congress 
acted to provide for the general welfare of all Americans.
  I believe that Congress was right when it decided that the problems 
of the lack of availability and affordability of health care and of 
health insurance and the rising health care costs that burden the 
American people, is a problem, ``plainly national in area and 
dimensions,'' as Justice Cardozo wrote of the widespread crisis of 
unemployment and insecurity during the Great Depression. I believe that 
it was right for Congress to determine that it is in the general 
welfare of the Nation to ensure that all Americans have access to 
affordable quality health care. But whether other Senators agree or 
disagree with me, none should argue that we should turn back to clock 
to the Great Depression when conservative activist judges prevented 
Congress from exercising its powers to make that determination.
  In seeking to discredit health insurance reform, the other side 
relies on a resurrection of long-discredited legal doctrines used by 
courts a century ago to tie Congress's hands by substituting their own 
views of property to strike down laws such as those guaranteeing a 
minimum wage and outlawing child labor. They have to rely on such cases 
of unbridled conservative judicial activism as Lochner v. New York, 
Shechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, Reagan v. Farmers Loan 
and Trust and the infamous Dred Scott case. Those dark days are long 
gone and better left behind. The Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, 
our history and congressional action all stand on the side of 
Congress's authority to enact health insurance reform legislation.
  Under article I, section 8, Congress has the power ``to regulate 
Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.'' Since at 
least the time of the Great Depression and the New Deal, Congress has 
been understood and acknowledged by the Supreme Court to have power 
pursuant to the commerce clause to regulate matters with a substantial 
effect on interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has long since upheld 
laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act against commerce clause 
challenges, ruling that Congress had the authority to outlaw child 
labor. The days when women and children could not be protected, when 
the public could not be protected from sick chickens infecting them, 
when farmers could not be protected and when any regulation that did 
not guarantee profits to corporations would be voided by the judiciary 
are long past. The reach of Congress' commerce clause authority has 
been long established and well settled.
  Even recent decisions by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican-
appointed justices have affirmed this rule of law. In 2005, the Supreme 
Court ruled in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress had the power under the 
commerce clause to prohibit the use of medical marijuana even though it 
was grown and consumed at home, because of its impact on the national 
market for marijuana. Surely if that law passes constitutional muster, 
Congress' actions to regulate the health care market that makes up one-
sixth of the American economy meets the test of substantially affecting 
commerce. Conservatives cannot have it both ways. Nor can they ignore 
the settled meaning of the Constitution as well as the authority of the 
American people's elected representatives in Congress.
  The regulation of health insurance clearly meets the test from Raich, 
since the activities ``taken in the aggregate, substantially affect 
interstate commerce.'' In fact, when the Senate considered the health 
insurance reform bill in December, it adopted a set of findings related 
to the impact of the individual mandate on interstate commerce. Among 
those findings, now the law, were that ``health insurance and health 
care services are a significant part of the national economy,'' that 
the individual ``requirement regulates activity that is commercial and 
economic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when 
health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased'' and 
that the ``requirement is essential to creating effective health 
insurance markets.''
  These findings demonstrate that Congress took into account the 
significant cumulative economic effects on the Nation of the rising 
costs of health care, with those costs making up a large percentage of 
our economy and with American businesses struggling to provide benefits 
to their employees. As set forth in a paper by Georgetown University 
and the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, which I 
discussed in December, the requirement for individuals to purchase 
health

[[Page S2015]]

insurance would address the problem of free riders, millions of 
Americans who refuse to buy health insurance and then rely on expensive 
emergency health care when faced with medical problems. This shifts the 
costs of their health care to people who do have insurance, which in 
turn has a significant effect on the costs of insurance premiums for 
covered Americans and on the economy as a whole. A requirement that all 
Americans have health insurance--like requirements to pay FICA--is 
within congressional power if Congress determines it to be essential to 
controlling spiraling health care costs. In passing health care reform, 
Congress determined that requiring that all Americans to have health 
insurance coverage, and preventing some from depending on expensive 
emergency services in place of regular health care, can and will help 
reduce the cost of health insurance premiums for those who already have 
insurance.
  Addressing these problems is at the core of Congress's powers under 
the commerce clause. In fact, the Supreme Court expressly addressed 
this issue 65 years ago, ruling in 1944 that insurance was interstate 
commerce and subject to Federal regulation. Congress responded to this 
decision in 1945 with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gave insurance 
companies an exemption from antitrust laws unless Federal regulation 
was made explicit under Federal law. It is the immunity from Federal 
antitrust law enacted in McCarran-Ferguson that I have been working to 
overcome with the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act 
of 2009. My proposal would repeal health insurance companies' 
antiquated exemption from the antitrust laws. These are the pro-
competition rules that apply to virtually all other businesses, to help 
promote vibrant markets and consumer choice. Competition and choice 
help lower costs, expand access and improve quality.
  I launched this effort last fall, built a hearing record to examine 
its merits and worked to build bipartisan support. House leaders late 
last year added it to their plan. And last month it became the first 
stand-alone part of the health reform package to pass on its own, in a 
strong bipartisan vote of 406 to 19 in the House. To me this is the 
latest proof that, appearances aside, there is much common ground in 
the health reform plan--more than partisan opponents or the insurance 
industry would have the public believe.
  Why would this exemption have been necessary if insurance was not 
interstate commerce? I strongly believe that the exemption in McCarran-
Ferguson is wrongheaded. But would anyone seriously contend that it is 
unconstitutional? Of course not.
  Now that we have enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act, I hope we will soon turn to this reform by taking up and passing 
the House-passed bill. We should end the health insurance exemption 
from our precompetitive Federal antitrust laws without delay.
  The Constitution contains in article I, section 8, the necessary and 
proper clause. That, too, provides a basis for congressional action. 
This clause gives Congress the power ``to make all Laws which shall be 
necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers 
and all other Powers vested by his Constitution in the United States.'' 
The Supreme Court settled the meaning of the necessary and proper 
clause 190 years ago in Justice Marshall's landmark decision in 
McCullough v. Maryland, during the dispute over the National Bank. 
Justice Marshall's wrote that ``the clause is placed among the powers 
of Congress, not among the limitations on those powers.'' The necessary 
and proper clause goes hand in hand with the commerce clause to ensure 
congressional authority to regulate activity with a significant 
economic impact.
  Congress has enacted and the President has signed into law the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This landmark legislation 
addresses our health care crisis and helps provide health care 
insurance for millions of Americans previously uninsured and seeks to 
encourage lower costs for Americans who are insured. We have acted to 
ensure that Americans not risk bankruptcy and disaster with every 
illness. Americans who work hard their entire lives should not be 
robbed of their family's security because health care is too expensive. 
Americans should not lose their life savings because they have the 
misfortune of losing a job or getting sick. That is not America.
  One of the great American successes of the last century was the 
establishment of a social safety net of which all Americans can be 
grateful and proud. Through Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, 
Congress established some of the cornerstones of American economic 
security. Comprehensive health insurance reform has now joined them. 
Congress has acted within its constitutional authority to legislate for 
the general welfare of all Americans. No conservative activist court, 
on any level, should overstep the judiciary's role by seeking to turn 
back the clock and deny a century of progress.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, we are here for the next hour to 
discuss the Affordable Care Act with my colleagues and my cochair of 
the Doctors Caucus, Dr. Gingrey, a fellow OB/GYN from Georgia. I thank 
the gentleman for being here today.
  We are going to break this hour up into several segments and talk 
about, number one, how the Affordable Care Act was initiated, how it 
actually came to be. Two, the promises that were made by the President 
and the Democratic Party about what the Affordable Care Act would do. 
The failures, which I think are probably fixable of the Web site--if, 
in 1969, we put a man on the Moon with a slide rule and a handheld 
adding machine, surely we can get a Web site to work in the year 2013. 
If we cannot overcome that, we are in trouble. Number four, I want to 
discuss something very near and dear to my heart, because I 
participated in this for years, which is medical education. I will go 
into this in more detail.
  We have a huge doctor shortage in America today, and it is getting 
worse.

[[Page H6984]]

A major university in my State, Vanderbilt University, this past year, 
that university has lowered their workforce by approximately 1,300 
people--it will, by the end of this year. It is very disconcerting for 
those people who lost good-paying jobs.
  We have had hospitals close in our region. We have had layoffs in our 
area, in the health care industry, for the first time in my medical 
lifetime, which has been over 40 years as a physician now.
  Also very distressing to me as a doctor and as a faculty member of 
the College of Medicine at East Tennessee State University, the Quillen 
College of Medicine and Vanderbilt University are reducing their class 
size by 10 percent.

                              {time}  2000

  They are also reducing the number of the M.D./Ph.D.s that they have. 
These are our future researchers to find the great cures for diseases 
in the future.
  There is a pipeline out there, and we certainly know that a vast 
number of our senior doctors are considering, or have retired, as my 
own personal physician has done, due to the effects of the Affordable 
Care Act. So we will discuss that in more detail.
  I think, also, we need to discuss and focus on the new taxes, and 
also, on the effects on business.
  Then lastly, perhaps--hasn't been discussed much recently, the 
effects on Medicare, quite frankly, with $700 billion being cut from 
Medicare.
  There is one particular part, Mr. Speaker, of this bill that Dr. 
Gingrey and I have worked on closely together in the Medicare portion 
of the Affordable Care Act that is called the Independent Payment 
Advisory Board. It hasn't gotten a lot of press because it hasn't 
affected any seniors yet.
  It's a board, an independent board, independent of Congress, that 
will determine how Medicare dollars are spent, and we will go into that 
if we have time in more detail toward the end of the hour.
  I think that is one of the most egregious parts of this bill when it 
comes to our seniors, and we are adding 10,000 new seniors per day, 
each and every day, over 3 million per year, with a decreasing number 
of physicians and less money in that very-needed program that needs 
reform.
  Let's go back, Dr. Gingrey, approximately, 4 years when we were here 
on the House floor debating this bill--and the premise of the 
Affordable Care Act I completely agree with, which is to lower costs 
and increase access to care. That is a noble, noble goal to have, and I 
still share that goal to this day.
  There were three committees of jurisdiction in the House of 
Representatives that looked at the Affordable Care Act: the Ways and 
Means Committee; Energy and Commerce; and the committee I serve on, 
Education and the Workforce.
  Those committees had a bill brought forth by the House of 
Representatives. It was voted on, debated in the various committees, 
brought to the House floor, and was voted on in a straight party-line 
vote. That particular bill did not include the IPAB and some other 
things that are in the permanent bill, the so-called ObamaCare, or the 
Affordable Care Act.
  The Senate then voted on Christmas Eve, I believe it was 2009, 
brought a bill back over here the following month. We debated it again 
on the House floor for a very short time and, famously, our then-
Speaker said we had to read the bill to find out what was in it.
  Well, guess what I did?
  It is a 2,600, 2,700-page bill, but I felt that a bill that affected 
ever American citizen in a very personal way deserved my attention, so 
I read that bill, and the surprises that you are seeing now I have been 
talking about now for 3\1/2\ years, as have my colleagues on the 
Doctors Caucus and others on our side of the aisle, and many, quite 
frankly, recently, in a bipartisan way.
  The only thing bipartisan about the Affordable Care Act was its 
opposition. I think some 32 Democrats voted against that bill.
  So it comes as no surprise to me when the President says--and we will 
go over the broken promises in a minute--it comes as no surprise to me 
when the President says, if you like your health insurance, you can 
keep it. That wasn't going to happen.
  Why did I know that?
  Let's go over the promises that were made. Number one was universal 
coverage. I quote. This is the President saying this. He wasn't the 
President then, but this was in June of 2007.

       I will sign a universal health care bill into law by the 
     end of my first term as President that will cover every 
     American.

  Well, that is a promise that hasn't been fulfilled. It does increase 
access by a massive expansion of Medicaid, and we will go through the 
Medicaid expansion in just a minute, about why some States chose to do 
it and why our State of Tennessee has chosen not to. And there are very 
good reasons why these Governors have chosen not to.
  There are a host of unintended consequences of this bill that we are 
dealing with today. The decreased payments to our hospitals have forced 
some of our rural hospitals and, certainly, where I live in rural 
America, has put great strain on these hospitals.
  Even in the more major medical center areas, as I pointed out, at 
Vanderbilt University, and many others, I have talked to colleagues 
today in Indiana who have experienced the same scenario.
  So the promises that were promised, there would be no new taxes on 
the middle class--here is the President's quote:

       I can make a firm pledge under my plan: no family making 
     less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase; 
     not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital 
     gains tax, not any of your taxes.

  That was September 12, 2008.
  The third promise, and this is one that anybody who has studied 
health insurance and has dealt with it in private business, as I have, 
knew was not going to be possible, was the outrageous claim that, by 
the end of his first term, that premiums would decrease by $2,500 a 
family. I mean, anybody would know better than that that has ever run a 
business.
  This is the quote:

       We will lower premiums up to $2,500 for a typical family 
     per year. We will do it by the end of my first term as 
     President of the United States.

  That was June 5, 2008.
  The next promise was there would be no increase in the deficit. No 
increase in the deficit. Here is the President's promise:

       I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits.

  That was Promise Number Four.
  And the last one, Promise Number Five, is, you can keep your plan if 
you like it, and here is the quote:
  ``If you like your doctor''--which, by the way, I like my doctor a 
lot; I went to medical school with him--``you will be able to keep your 
doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to 
keep your health plan, period.''
  Well, let me point out at the end of that period, that people who 
work for me now in this congressional office have lost their plan, so 
that is not true:
  No one will take it away, no matter what.
  Well, I certainly don't see that as being true. The failure of the 
Web site rollout, we will get into that a little later. I think that, 
as I said, certainly, if we can't correct a Web site, if we can't build 
a Web site, I have no faith that this plan will ever be workable.
  I would now like to yield some time to my good friend and colleague 
from Georgia. We have been joined by Dr. Paul Broun, also from Georgia, 
a family practitioner, but I would like to turn it over now to Dr. Phil 
Gingrey from Georgia.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Tennessee, Dr. Roe, for yielding time to me.
  It is incredibly concerning that the Obama administration has 
continued full speed ahead on a rollout of a system, even after 
numerous warnings from vendors and from Congress.
  The Web site has led to confusion in the insurance marketplace, as 
well as put consumers' personal information at risk to lax security 
protocols.
  Even after the Web site is technically fixed, Mr. Speaker, as Dr. Roe 
mentioned, and it probably will be, consumers will still face higher 
premiums and the likelihood that they will be unable to see the doctors 
to which they have grown accustomed.
  Mr. Speaker, I have heard from a number of my constituents in the 
past few weeks about the disastrous effects of the President's health 
care law. I will take a little time this evening to

[[Page H6985]]

share with my colleagues a few of the observations from good, solid 
Georgians.
  Tom, a Georgia Blue Cross customer, told me his ``Blue Cross policy 
went up originally by about $50 due to the Affordable Care Act. About 2 
weeks ago I got a note that said my old policy no longer exists, and my 
new policy will now cost $100 more.'' That is a quote from Tom.
  Dottie, from metro Atlanta, told me that her husband's employer was 
forced to drop their family plan and would, instead, offer them only 
two more costly options. Either plan would increase their premium by at 
least $160 a week, Mr. Speaker.
  A mother in my district told me that her young daughter's Humana plan 
was canceled only 2 weeks after being promised that the price of the 
new plan would be locked down for a full year.
  Mr. Speaker, the President kept telling the American people, and this 
is the quote, if they ``liked their insurance they could keep it, 
period''--and the period is part of the quote. It should have gone on, 
as Dr. Roe suggested, until they can't.
  This promise has surely been broken. Millions of citizens have 
received cancelation notices from their insurers. They are now left 
with uncertainty over whether this new coverage will also be 
affordable.
  Speaking of affordability, Mr. Speaker, let me share with you a few 
other stories from constituents, and then I will yield back to the 
gentleman from Tennessee because I know there are other Members on the 
floor that also want to speak on this issue.
  Mike told me that ObamaCare ``has been a financial disaster'' for his 
family. It used to cost him just under $300 a month to cover his wife 
and daughter on his insurance, but, under ObamaCare, even that bronze 
plan--you know, there are four options, and bronze is supposedly the 
least expensive--will cost him $700 a month.
  And get this, Mr. Speaker: a $5,000 deductible. He was formerly 
paying $300 a month. If you like your insurance, you can keep it.
  As Dr. Roe said, Mr. Speaker, everybody's premiums are going to be 
going down on an average of $2,500 per year. Not so. Not so.
  Teresa from Cartersville, also in my 11th Congressional District of 
Georgia, she and her husband told me that their premium is increasing 
from $550 to more than $900 a month. That is almost, Mr. Speaker, a 40 
percent increase.
  Robert, from metropolitan Atlanta, again, a little part of my 
district, told me that even though they were underwritten in June, his 
wife's policy had increased from $387 to $557 a month. That is a 30 
percent increase.
  Finally, before I yield back to the gentleman from Tennessee, Robyn 
from Atlanta received notice that her family's premiums will increase 
by 15 percent without any additional benefits.
  I yield back to Dr. Roe, and I look forward to continuing this 
discussion with my colleagues as we go through the evening.
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Let me back up a little bit so that this is a little bit more 
understandable for people. Typically, in this country--and we had 
problems. There is no question we needed health care reform. I think 
everybody in this Chamber--
  It is one of the reasons that the doctors that you see here tonight 
ran for Congress, because we wanted to be part of the health care 
reform debated here. Unfortunately, we were not.
  There were nine of us in our Physicians Caucus on the Republican side 
during the health care debate. Not one of us, not one, was included in 
the debate on health care. Not any amendment. We offered 80 amendments, 
to my recollection, to this health care bill, and not one was allowed 
to be heard on the House floor and voted on.
  This would be a better bill if the other side of the aisle had simply 
slowed down, taken a breath, and let us help amend this bill.
  People say now, well, Phil, can't you just tweak it a little bit and 
help?
  No, you cannot. It is so complicated and so expensive, it is very 
difficult to do.
  Now, this bill does do some things I like. I do like the under 26-
year-old being able to stay on their parents' plan. The private market 
would have offered that.
  You also had a problem with preexisting conditions. I want to spend 
just a minute with that because it is not totally understood, or not 
understood well by the public.
  We worry about us getting a preexisting condition, losing our 
insurance and not being able to get coverage. In America, about 160 
million of us get our insurance through our employer, through ERISA-
based plans. Preexisting conditions do not affect those plans. You 
cannot be denied coverage. My practice had an ERISA-approved plan. You 
had to take everybody in the plan.
  Number two, if you get Medicaid, you cannot be denied coverage, and 
Number three, if you have Medicare. So it really left the small group 
market and the individual market and the uninsured.
  Now, people are wondering, why did I lose my insurance coverage?
  In other words, I had a policy I liked.
  I want to tell you today, Mr. Speaker, one of the most arrogant 
things I think I have ever heard in my life I heard on TV this last 
week by several pundits, and those comments are this: that your 
insurance is no good. I heard the President say that.
  Well, look, not everybody can eat at Ruth's Chris. Some people have 
to eat at McDonald's or have to eat at Shoney's. They can't all eat at 
the most expensive one, but they buy what they can afford and what 
meets their needs.
  The reason that the costs are going up so much are the following: in 
this bill, there is something called essential health benefits. You 
don't get to decide what you buy for your family. The government 
decides what you buy for your family.

                              {time}  2015

  And let me read this to you, because I want you to hear this very 
closely to see if you need all of these services. One is ambulatory 
patient services; that sounds pretty good. Emergency services. Sure, 
you want a plan that covers you when you go to the emergency room. 
Hospitalization, absolutely. I think you will see most plans do that.
  Maternity and newborn care. Well, I don't know about that. What does 
a single 30-year-old male need maternity care for? What do I need 
maternity care for at my age? I certainly have cold sweats thinking 
about that right now.
  Mental health and substance abuse disorder services, including 
behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and 
habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and 
wellness services; chronic disease management; pediatric services, 
including oral and vision care. Well, if you are a family at an age 
where you don't need all of those things, probably your plan doesn't 
hit some of those. If you miss any of them, your plan is not an 
approved plan.
  The second thing that made you lose your plan was--and this is where 
I challenge the President here tonight--one of two things occurred. I 
read the plan and I understood by reading that plan that if you changed 
anything in the bill, if you changed the prescription drugs, if you 
changed your copay, if you changed anything significantly in that plan, 
you lost your grandfathered status, or if you didn't meet the essential 
health benefits. No one said that.
  So if the President had read his own bill, he would have known that 
and would not have come out and said, If you like your plan, you can 
keep your plan, because that clearly isn't true. Or number two, as 
Congressman Kurt Schrader said today, that we were misled. I think that 
is the term he used. So either of those two things occurred. If the 
President said, You can keep your plan, or he just did it for political 
purposes, which I hope he didn't do because a lot of people are hurt.
  Mr. Speaker, 16,000 low-income small business people in my State had 
a plan called Cover Tennessee. It wasn't the greatest plan in the 
world. It covered, I think, 12 doctor visits a year, all preventive 
services, an operation. It covered up to about $25,000. It didn't have 
lifetime limits. And 16,000 people had that. They could afford that. 
And many of them bought a catastrophic policy so that if they had 
something that cost more than $25,000, it would be covered.

[[Page H6986]]

So it was basic health insurance coverage. It did for them and their 
families what they needed. It gave them some certainty and peace of 
mind. That is all gone. They have lost that.
  As Dr. Gingrey was pointing out just a moment ago, he was mentioning 
some people in Georgia--and you can find this story from the Atlantic 
to the Pacific Ocean. One story I heard this weekend, an employer of 
mine who is a building contractor, he has looked at his business. He 
has 110 employees. He said, Phil, I think I am just going to have to 
pay the $200,000 fine. I can't afford what they are going to force me 
to buy. I can't do it and stay in business.
  I have an employee that I know personally because she works in my 
office whose insurance is going to go from $400 a month for her family 
of three with the ObamaCare plan--``if you like your plan, you can keep 
it''--to $800 a month. This is an employee who makes in the mid-$50,000 
range. This is not somebody who is rich who can afford this. That is a 
car payment or a college education payment or whatever she wants to 
spend her money on. You can hear this story over and over again.
  There are 66,000 Tennesseans who got a letter from Blue Cross 
explaining that their plans didn't meet the essential benefits package 
in the individual market. That is one insurance company, and this is 
going on all over.
  So this business about the costs going down--I think we will be on 
the Key Bridge jumping in the Potomac River when we finally get the 
bill for this. That is how expensive it is going to be.
  And, by the way, most people don't understand this. A lot of our 
Governors have read the fine print; and Governor Bill Haslam of 
Tennessee, a good friend of mine, wanted to expand coverage. He wants 
to expand coverage. But he wants it done through market-oriented 
principles. And one of the things that we have had in Tennessee with 
our health care coverage expansion is that we went through health care 
reform 20 years ago.
  In 1993-94, we began a program called TennCare. In the TennCare plan, 
we had a problem with access and not enough people had coverage in our 
State. So we did this. And within 10 short years, our spending had 
tripled. And almost half the people--47 percent, I think--of the people 
who got insurance on TennCare dropped their private health insurance 
and got it through the TennCare program. What our Democratic Governor 
Phil Bredesen did in the mid-2000s was--because we have a balanced 
budget amendment in our State, with the approval of the legislature--he 
had to cut 200,000 people from the rolls.
  And people say to me, Dr. Roe, don't you think this bill will just 
fall under its own weight? And I say, No, I don't. And the reason is 
because the Federal Government can deficit-spend. We can print money. 
If we had to have a balanced budget in this body right here that we are 
standing in, I can assure you, we would be having a different 
discussion about this bill.
  One other thing I want to read about the Governors that have signed 
up for this great deal with Medicaid, which is a program for our low-
income people--
  And by the way, I want to publicly state that the group I am in and 
the group I was with from the time Medicaid became available until I 
left practice, we took those Medicaid patients; and for many of them, 
we didn't get paid a lot of money. But that is what physicians do, we 
care for people who are uninsured and people who have policies like 
Medicaid.
  But this new policy, the insurance policies must cover these benefits 
in order to be certified and offered in the health insurance 
marketplace. States expanding their Medicaid programs must provide 
these benefits, these essential health benefits to people who are newly 
eligible for Medicaid. So that means at the end of the 3 short years, 
the percent that the State has, which is no guarantee, is going to be a 
large sum of money and much larger than I had thought of after I 
started seeing these premium increases.

  The other thing that has been said out there--and I have heard it for 
the last 4 years--is that Republicans have no ideas about health care 
reform. Well, there is a plethora of our ideas from this side of the 
aisle for health care reform. And one that I happen to have right here 
in my pocket is a Republican Study Committee called the American Health 
Care Reform Act, and I chaired the Health Subcommittee which wrote this 
bill. Dr. Tom Price, Dr. Broun of Georgia have a bill. Louie Gohmert, 
others. There are many of them. The Republican substitute bill of 4 
years ago is an excellent health care bill that is market-centered. And 
it does something that I think is essential for the American health 
care system to survive as we know it, and that is, to maintain the 
physician-patient relationship.
  This will tear that down because what does it do? So many people are 
going to lose access to their doctor. And as there are fewer and fewer 
doctors out there to see you, the waits are going to get longer and 
longer and longer. I think that is the very fabric that has made us the 
system that we are and the envy of the world, where people come from 
all over the world. And I think that can cease. And when you see great 
universities, like Vanderbilt University, cutting down on the number of 
doctors they are educating because of these cost constraints and 
cutting down on the number of young doctors that are going into the 
M.D.-Ph.D. programs that go into medical research and into faculties in 
medical school, boy, 10, 15, 20 years ago, we are going to suffer a 
great price for the mistake we have made right now.
  I would like to take now the opportunity to introduce one of my 
colleagues from Georgia, a family practice physician, Dr. Paul Broun.
  Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Thank you, Dr. Roe.
  The Federal Government is out of control. It has become too big. It 
is spending too much. It is taxing too much. It is regulating too much. 
It is borrowing too much. And it is sticking its ugly nose into our 
business too much. It has to stop, and ObamaCare does every one of 
those things.
  As a medical doctor, I understand firsthand the disastrous effects of 
ObamaCare and have been fighting from the very beginning to stop this 
terrible law.
  Every day, I hear from my constituents in the 10th District of 
Georgia on how this law is hurting them. Premiums are increasing. 
Cancelation letters are flying all across the State of Georgia. 
Business owners are being forced to lay off employees, and patients are 
finding that they no longer can afford their health insurance 
altogether.
  I will share with you a few examples. One Georgia businessman, who is 
the owner of several fast food restaurants, currently employs over 200 
full-time workers. He recently told me that he is seriously considering 
letting them all go and hiring only part-time employees; this due to 
the burden of ObamaCare.
  A resident of Henry County wrote to me that as an uninsured woman 
with preexisting conditions, she was looking forward to enrolling in 
ObamaCare. Then when she went to sign up, she found that a quarter of 
her income would have to be paid in premiums alone. Due to the high 
cost, she had no other choice but to remain uninsured.
  One man from Monroe, Georgia, contacted me just last week to inform 
me that his insurance costs have increased by 800 percent, 800 percent 
due to ObamaCare.
  A woman from Barrow County told me that her husband's insurance that 
he bought through AARP has already been canceled, and to get another 
policy with the same coverage would cost him $150 more a month than 
what he is paying now. This couple currently pays more in health 
insurance than what they pay for their mortgage. Increasing their 
payments by an extra $150 a month would be a tremendous, tremendous 
financial burden on them.
  Sadly, this is just the beginning. It is expected that more than 
400,000 Georgians will lose their current health insurance due to 
ObamaCare. Until we are able to stop this disastrous law, we will 
continue to hear more and more of these stories.
  As a medical doctor, I know what is best for my patients. That is why 
I have introduced legislation, H.R. 2900, the Patient OPTION act. It 
would repeal ObamaCare in full and put patients in charge of their 
health care decisions, where they can buy health insurance at a cheaper 
price than what they are currently paying. My Patient OPTION Act was 
endorsed by FreedomWorks in the last Congress.

[[Page H6987]]

  My bill will make health insurance cheaper for everyone--literally 
cheaper for everyone. Not like the President promised us. But he lied. 
It will provide access to good quality health care for all Americans, 
and it will save Medicare from going broke.
  If Americans want full control of their coverage, health insurance at 
a lower cost, and the freedom to make their own decisions in health 
care, then the Patient OPTION Act is the only true solution.
  It is clear that Georgians and Americans are hurting under ObamaCare. 
That is why I will not stop fighting to rip ObamaCare out by the roots 
and to replace it with reform that will actually lower costs, deliver 
care, and focus on the true needs of all American families.
  Through the voice of ``we the people'' demanding the repeal of 
ObamaCare, we can work to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with 
legislation that serves the best interest of patients, not government. 
That solution is my Patient OPTION Act, H.R. 2900.
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. I thank the gentleman.
  I would like to spend a few minutes now beginning to talk a little 
bit about the effects on businesses and how this will affect 
individuals.
  I serve as the chairman of the Health, Employment, Labor, and 
Pensions Subcommittee on the Committee on Education and the Workforce; 
and we have held several hearings around the country over the last 2, 3 
years outside of Washington, D.C. We have held them in Concord, North 
Carolina; Evansville, Indiana; Butler, Pennsylvania; Lexington, 
Kentucky; and others. And we have actually asked small businesses to 
come in and testify on how this plan will affect their business.

  Let me give you just a couple of examples. We were looking at a small 
textile owner in North Carolina, and I won't mention his name tonight. 
But, anyway, it is part of the public record. He has a business where 
he had supplied--his business, he was self-insured as many small 
municipalities, large municipalities are. Many businesses are self-
insured. And it didn't look like their plans were going to be affected 
too much by the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare bill. However, they 
have to pay a $63 fee per person insured. Most people don't know this 
because it doesn't personally affect them. It just affects the business 
owner. Or in the case of my hometown of Johnson City, Tennessee, that 
little bill is going to come to $177,000 next year. One major 
corporation, which will remain unnamed, came to my office and shared 
with me that their bill for that this year would be $25 million.
  Let me explain to you about this small businessman in North Carolina. 
He provided 80 percent of the health insurance. The employee paid 20. 
He paid all preventive services. If you needed a colonoscopy, if your 
wife needed a mammogram, he paid 100 percent. He had a nurse onsite and 
a wellness program that he paid for. It is the Cadillac of all 
Cadillacs.
  So what does he get for that? He gets a $63 fee for every single 
person he has insured this year. The following year, it decreases a 
little bit and the following year. Guess what that money is used for. 
That money is used to indemnify insurance companies so that they will 
provide insurance on these exchanges, and it will limit as a stop-loss 
for them. That is how complicated this bill is.
  Now, I have had numerous businesses that are in the 50 range that I 
have talked to. And where we are, small business is the kingpin. The 
majority of our people are employed by small business. What incentive 
is there for a business to go above 50 when this arbitrary number was 
picked? And I have no idea to this day why 50 was picked.
  So what is magical about 50? Well, if you go above 50 employees, as 
my practice is, and you decide not to provide health insurance, and you 
are now, that costs you $2,000 per employee as a fine, tax, penalty, 
whatever Judge Roberts wants to call it.

                              {time}  2030

  But that is what this is--a tax, I assume, a penalty or a fee on 
those. Many people are willing to pay that. Businesses are. Or, if they 
are at 47 or 48, guess what they are doing? They are not going to 50. 
Or, if they need more employees, what are they doing? They are hiring 
part-time people.
  I can assure you that I have heard this over and over and over again 
about how businesses are cutting back their employees' hours to under 
30 hours a week, because now we define full-time employment as 30 hours 
per week. I assume the only place 30 hours a week is full-time 
employment must be France, because there isn't any place I know of on 
the planet that 30 hours a week is full-time employment. Certainly, in 
Tennessee, it is not.
  I would now yield to Dr. Gingrey, again, my friend from Georgia, if 
he would like to have a few words to say.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I know 
there is another member of the House GOP Doctors Caucus that has just 
joined us, so I will just take a moment and then yield back to Dr. Roe 
so he can yield to Dr. Harris.
  I wanted to take just a moment to emphasize what Dr. Roe was talking 
about, Mr. Speaker, in regard to these mandates.
  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act, which we found out now is the 
``Unaffordable Care Act,'' all o.."

                 IN SUPPORT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we are having debates about health care 
because Americans are nervous about changing something so important to 
their families, and that, of course, makes politicians nervous about 
reform.
  This skepticism is understandable. Attempting to adjust policies and 
programs that comprise now 17 percent of our economy, the biggest 
driver of the Federal deficit that literally touches every American 
family, poses daunting challenges. Yet, as people begin the analysis, 
the appropriate comparison is not some idealized, magical state but the 
comparison to the path we are on, which everybody agrees is 
unsustainable.
  Medical costs, left unchecked, will literally bankrupt the country. 
The Department of Defense will spend more on health care this year than 
China uses to run its entire military operation for 7 months. Every 
objective, independent expert acknowledges and laments the fact that 
the United States is the world's health care underachiever. We pay more 
for health care than our major allies and competitors in Europe, Japan, 
and Canada, but our people get sick more often; they die sooner, and 
unlike any other country, people are bankrupted by medical costs--about 
2,000 people per day. All the while, we have a record number of 
uninsured Americans--now over 50 million.
  Sadly, we are getting exactly what we paid for: more procedures, 
multiple providers, an emphasis on specialty care rather than someone 
who can help us with our own efforts to negotiate this complex, 
fragmented health care system. America actually spends more 
administering our health insurance system and finding ways to deny care 
than any other country in the world spends on providing care.
  Starting from scratch, we could give better care for less money, but 
we are not starting from scratch. We are starting with an economic and 
structural behemoth, encompassing, as I said, 17 percent of the 
economy. It is the largest employer in most communities, and it has 
evolved over two-thirds of a century of public and private investment 
and government legislation. Today, our hybrid system is largely 
administered through hundreds of agencies, programs, and large 
providers, with the Federal Government paying half the bill directly.
  The good news is that we have proven that we can get better results 
for less than we are spending, and the health care reform legislation 
provides this framework. First, we don't need more money. In fact, if 
we implement the existing legislation, it can be a source of savings in 
the future.
  The good news is we don't have to deal with unproven techniques or 
technologies. We know what to do. We don't even have to look at foreign 
models that are more successful than ours. We can look right here in 
the United States. My community of Portland, Oregon, delivers better 
health care for Medicare, for instance, to its recipients than other 
communities where costs are twice as high. It's not just Portland. This 
can be found in areas in the

[[Page H237]]

West and the upper Midwest. There are also innovative health care 
practices in the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, and Gunderson 
Lutheran.
  The government, itself, has proven how to be more efficient. The 
Veterans Administration has a practice model for older citizens with 
complex health problems that face our veterans. The VA has automated 
its medical records system. It pays its doctors for performance, not 
procedures, and they figured out a way to get better prescription drug 
costs for millions of our veterans.
  Many of the techniques for reducing the number of unnecessary 
hospital admissions, for bundling services, for having accountable care 
organizations are known and actually supported by my Republican 
friends. They've been embraced by Republican Governors.
  This is not foreign territory. We know it can work. The path forward 
is clear. It is important not to lose 2 important years in reforming 
our medical system, giving better health care, and starting to reduce 
these massive future deficits.
  After having identified weak spots in the implementation, let's work 
to hold people accountable. Don't attack the CBO for scoring the bill 
as written, which is their job. Attack efforts to undermine the cost-
saving elements of the bill. If States can more creatively provide 
health care envisioned in the exchanges, let them do it. Give them the 
waivers, and encourage them to experiment as long as they meet minimum 
national standards.
  Absolutely allow people to purchase insurance across State lines to 
improve competition and choice, but only after everybody agrees to 
provide insurance according to the same quality standards of 
accountability. That prevents gaps in coverage. We don't want massive 
marketing budgets while denying the money for essential treatment. We 
need not to have long protracted battles over if we understand and 
agree upon the terms.
  We've reached a critical point where we cannot continue on the path 
that we've been headed. We do have reform legislation that encourages 
much of what has bipartisan support. We are spending more money than we 
need to and there are huge opportunities to improve the quality of 
service. I would hope that this exercise would be the last of the 
political ritual on health care. Instead let's turn to working with the 
Administration to figure out how to achieve the objectives, so critical 
for our citizens.

         CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs. 
Christensen) is recognized for 30 minutes.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, it's an honor for me to join my 
colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for this half hour or so 
to talk to the American people about the importance of the provisions 
of the Affordable Care Act. For African Americans and other people of 
color, as well as rural Americans, who make up more than half of the 
uninsured, we cannot allow the law and the consumer protections to be 
repealed. Not when we have just gotten one foot in the health care 
door, some of us for the very first time.
  For African Americans, who have higher death rates from all causes 
than any other population group, the preventive services, the 
strengthening of the public health force, the diversifying of an 
expanded health workforce, the community health workers, the community 
health centers, the Offices of Minority Health, those equity provisions 
cannot be repealed. It's a matter of life and death for us.
  I know that the Republicans and their leadership who are calling for 
repeal won't ever say that they want to take away those benefits of the 
law that make sure sick children can be ensured, that allow families to 
keep their children who can't get jobs right away on their insurance 
until they are 26, or make sure that your insurance will be there for 
you when you need it most, when you get sick. They won't tell you that 
they want to take those away, but that's exactly what would happen if 
they are allowed to unravel this very carefully put together law.
  Moreover, it should cause concern to every freedom-loving and 
justice-seeking person in this country that two of the very first acts 
of this 112th Congress have been to take away rights, privileges, or 
benefits from United States citizens. They took away the vote in the 
Committee of the Whole from Representatives elected and sent here by 
over 5 million Americans.
  And now the leadership is trying to take away services and benefits 
that in effect would take away the right that everyone should have to 
health care. Whatever the leadership tries to take away next, good 
people must stand and speak and act to prevent them from doing so, as 
we must not let them repeal the job-creating health care reform law 
now.

                              {time}  2130

  Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who we remembered yesterday, spoke 
about the appalling silence of good people.
  So, my fellow Americans, what I am saying to you is we cannot be 
silent. I know it must be difficult for you, our constituents, you, our 
employers, to know what the Affordable Care Act does and what it 
doesn't do, because there is so much distortion of the facts. So to 
help explain what the bill, what the law does, and how devastating the 
repeal would be, I want to now yield to my colleagues.
  I will begin by yielding to the gentleman Georgia (Mr. Johnson).
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank my colleague for yielding to me.
  I must admit that I feel somewhat, gosh, it seems like only yesterday 
that the Republicans were accusing us of not taking care of what was 
the business at hand, which was job creation and what they call 
reckless spending. They accused us of wasting our time in the 111th 
Congress where we should have been dealing with jobs and spending, and 
they are doing the same thing.
  They are wasting their time. The first month of the 112th Congress, 
they are wasting their time trying to repeal health care for Americans, 
the Affordable Care Act. It's mind-boggling to me that after the 
Democrats' first month in office we dealt with the recovery package, 
jobs, and thereafter we went through a long process of putting in place 
a measure that will create 4 million new jobs in this economy that they 
ran into the ground.
  We pulled the car out of the ditch, got the car running, ready to 
create 4 million new jobs, health care, 4 million new jobs to 
accommodate the 32 million more Americans who would have access to the 
health care system in this country as a result of our passage of that 
act. And the Republicans, the first thing they do is want to kill a 
job-creating act that will enable their constituents and mine to have 
affordable health care.
  It boggles the mind that we would want to turn the clock back, that 
we would want to start walking in the opposite direction, taking away 
benefits that have already gone into effect under the health care act 
that we passed. They want to hurt small businesses which are able to 
receive a 35 percent tax credit when they spend money insuring their 
employees.
  I saw a report earlier today indicating that hundreds of thousands of 
new policies have been issued by insurance companies based on these 
small businesses of less than 50 people that are choosing to offer 
health care insurance to their employees. That is significant.
  The health insurance industry is making a profit by offering fair 
coverage to Americans. Preexisting conditions were something that young 
people, children, were denied insurance for under the old regime of 
insurance regulation. Under our act that the Democrats passed, no more 
can you ban children from getting insurance based on preexisting 
conditions, and that is something that's good.
  My colleague from Iowa was just talking about a young child in his 
district who would be denied coverage for a preexisting condition if 
his parents had to go back into the market to purchase insurance due to 
loss of a job or whatever, move, whatever the case might be. So this is 
quite significant. We don't want to take that health care coverage away 
from the children who have received it even though they have 
preexisting conditions.
  The $250 rebate for seniors who had reached the dreaded doughnut 
hole, seniors got a $250 check in the mail in 2010 to help them with 
that. In 2011, they will get a 50 percent discount on all brand name 
and generic drugs, 50 percent. That is going to help so many Americans 
with their drug bills. This is what they want to repeal. They want to 
cost you, as a consumer, more money for prescription drugs.
  And I am happy to stand on the side of those who say ``no'' to a 
repeal of the health care legislation that we passed.
  They want to be able to repeal provisions in the law that prevent and 
prohibit insurance companies from canceling your insurance when you get 
sick. That's a commonsense regulation to protect American consumers. My 
friends on the other side of the aisle would, at the behest of those in 
the insurance industry who spent about $100 million to defeat health 
care legislation--and that was unsuccessful, so they went out and spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars more to defeat the Democrats who voted 
for it. And so now we are at the point where they want to reciprocate 
to those who elected them at the expense of the very American people 
who voted for them. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, Mr. 
Speaker, it really does not.
  Lifetime caps on coverage already in effect, they would repeal that. 
They would allow the sale of insurance policies that would have a cap 
on them, a lifetime cap. So you would pay ever-increasing premiums with 
an ever-lessening amount of lifetime insurance coverage.
  Well, we have taken that cap off. We have taken the unfairness out of 
that equation by mandating that those clauses in insurance contracts 
are void and unenforceable. So no more lifetime caps on insurance. 
These are some of the things that enabled the insurance companies and 
their corporate bosses, offices, shareholders and the like to obtain 
millions and millions and billions and billions of dollars of profits 
every year, going up every year.
  Your premiums going up also, just reckless; no regulatory impact, no 
care about what that's doing to America.

[[Page H250]]

It's actually costing the taxpayers a lot of money, Mr. Speaker, 
because if people don't have insurance, that does not immunize them 
from getting sick.

                              {time}  2140

  We're all going to get sick one day. We're all going to need medical 
care. We're all going to, at some point, need the care of a doctor or a 
nurse. And it costs money. And if we don't have insurance, it can't be 
paid for. So people without insurance don't get access to the health 
care system until they get so ill that they have to go to the emergency 
room. And at that point, taxpayers have to subsidize that cost. And so 
it stands to reason that with 17 percent of our gross domestic product 
being spent for medical care in this country, and the fact that that 
has an impact on our interstate commerce, it means that the Federal 
Government certainly has a role to play in regulating the health 
insurance industry. And that's exactly what we did.
  I want to now recognize, or flip it, if you will, back to my good 
friend from the Virgin Islands.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. I want to thank you, Mr. Johnson, for helping to 
clarify some of the important areas that are provided for in the 
Affordable Care Act. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but 
not everyone is entitled to creating their own facts. And I think what 
we're hearing tonight are the facts.
  I would like to yield now 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas, 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank the gentlelady. It is a pleasure to 
be able to join my colleagues on the floor, including Congressman 
Gregory Meeks of New York, who we'll have the opportunity to hear from, 
and I thank Dr. Christensen for your continued leadership, and my 
colleague on Judiciary Committee, we had the opportunity to contribute 
to the debate today.
  The Judiciary Committee has as its jurisdiction the Constitution, and 
our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about that this 
is unconstitutional. It baffles me and almost frustrates me because I'm 
trying to grab hold to what the argument is, particularly since we have 
had Medicare by the Federal Government since 1965, and it has withstood 
any constitutional challenge, and that was implemented under the 
Commerce Act.
  But frankly, if we have an argument to make on the Constitution, I 
will share with you why this is clearly a constitutional bill, because 
we are actually denying people both due process and equal protection 
under the law under the present system because we have a nation that is 
divided between the haves and have-nots. Forty million-plus, 44 
million, now I hear 32 million persons were uninsured. That's what 
grabbed our attention. Those people did not have access to health care.
  Clearly, if you look at the Constitution that says that the 14th 
Amendment says equal protection under the law, all people treated 
equally, and the Fifth Amendment says can't deprive someone of life or 
liberty without due process. Well, I can tell you over the time that we 
debated this bill we saw the numbers of people who actually died 
because they could not get access to health care. We are reminded of 
our good colleague, Congressman Cummings, who told the story over and 
over again of a young teenager, 12- or 13-year-old boy, African 
American boy, who had an abscess, a tooth abscess, and clearly could 
have been saved, his life was before him. But he died because his 
mother did not have insurance or really did not have access to go 
anywhere to have this particular health matter taken care of. It became 
a crisis, and he died.
  So I want to say to my friends, these are the basic points that I 
want to raise today while I discuss this question of the 14th Amendment 
and the Fifth Amendment. First of all, you hear the question of how 
offended people are, I don't want to be told to buy insurance. Why 
should I have to be forced to buy insurance? Well, as everyone knows, 
there is a 10th Amendment that says what is not left to the Federal 
Government is given to the States. States require you to have auto 
insurance. If you do not have it, you are fined. You get a ticket. 
Because they have calculated that the burden of not having health 
insurance is too great to bear. And so when we think of people not 
having health insurance because they don't have access, we have 
determined that the burden is too great to bear, $143 billion if this 
bill is repealed right away, and $1 trillion over 20 years that we will 
lose, or the deficit will be built. And I would imagine it might be 
more if you determine the people that will be uninsured who will go on 
to the county system.
  Does everybody know in these districts around the Nation who are 
complaining about this bill that your hospitals, your county hospitals 
that are burdening your local taxpayers will be actually compensated 
for uncompensated care? I don't know about anyone here, but I can tell 
you my hospitals are jumping for joy.
  And so I just want to point this out. Children with preexisting 
conditions are denied coverage, that is the sickle cell child, that is 
the individual with heart disease. We determined in our Democratic 
Policy and Steering Committee that children are the greatest that have 
the possibility of dying because of lack of coverage. And so all of 
these children, asthma, parents who have children with asthma, they are 
born, and there are babies with asthma. Do you realize they cannot or 
could not get insurance even on their parents' insurance? Asthma. How 
many children have died with asthma? Particularly in the minority 
community, where we have been subjected to poor quality living 
conditions. Maybe the air quality, because of where we live, industrial 
waste, or maybe it is because of the quality of the house that you are 
in, asbestos, other ailments that create conditions that cause 
respiratory illnesses in children, those are respiratory illnesses, 
young people age 26. A young man by the name of Andrew today said he's 
been working very hard, he graduated from college, but unfortunately 
the job that he had offered to him has been pushed back because of the 
economy. He is working to get more experience as an intern with no 
compensation. His family cannot afford to keep him on to pay for 
independent insurance at this point. But yet he is being constructive, 
and he can be constructive because he can be on his parents' insurance. 
Pregnant women and breast and prostate cancer patients, in particular, 
African American women and minority women have a devastating form of 
breast cancer. My father had prostate cancer, and at the age he was and 
the atmosphere that we were in and the medical access he had at that 
time, one, he didn't tell the family, two, we were uninformed about 
this thing called prostate cancer, and we didn't find out about it 
until it had metastasized. My father actually had lung cancer and brain 
cancer.

  There is a statistic: An African American male over 65 that did not 
have the proper access to health care to be able to catch his prostate 
cancer. Now this bill will provide for preventive care so that members, 
no matter what economic station you are in or status you are in, you 
have the ability to access health care, meaning you can go to a 
community health clinic or the community health centers, excuse me, or 
you may be able to buy your own health insurance at the rate in the 
amount you can.
  There is a complaint here, as I said, about lacking the ability or 
not wanting to buy health insurance. Well, I would argue to that 
person, the argument I made about the 10th Amendment and automobile 
insurance, but I also argue, would you rather have these individuals 
die or burden the massive public health system? Or would you rather 
have them have access to be healthy as opposed to being sick?
  Then something has been said, job-killing bill. And one of the points 
that the Republicans make is 650,000 jobs lost. They are not telling 
the accurate story. The 650,000 jobs lost are people deciding not to 
work or to work less because they now have the ability to get their own 
insurance that is not tied to a job through the exchange. That is the 
accuracy of it. It's voluntary, voluntary separation from a job because 
I am independent now to be able to go into business, to be a sole 
entrepreneur, a sole proprietor, and still have my insurance. And so 
these people would immediately be thrown off because a pregnant woman 
would be considered a preexisting disease; breast cancer, obviously one 
of the more devastating diseases; prostate cancer. And

[[Page H251]]

do you know what else? Heart disease which kills or has 43 million 
women today living with heart disease, some of whom do not know it 
because they do not have preventive care.
  And then, our seniors have been frightened by death panels. Seniors, 
let me simply say to you, there will be living panels because you will 
get a 50 percent discount on your doughnut hole process and brand name 
prescription drugs. But more importantly, you'll be able to have a 
primary care doctor, you'll have community health clinics you can go 
to, you'll have what we call a medical home so you won't have to be 
worrying about, who is my doctor? You will have a consistent doctor, 
maybe even electronic records.
  Particularly hard-hit are minority seniors or seniors in rural areas 
where hospitals are not even. But if they can go to a community health 
clinic that can diagnose them so they don't have to go to an emergency 
room or be helicoptered to a major city because they reached a crisis, 
seniors, this is a living bill for you.

                              {time}  2150

  And then, of course, this whole question of the deficit, I've already 
mentioned, but this idea of small businesses, let me tell you that 
small businesses are jumping for joy. Dr. Odetta Coin today said to us 
that she is glad that her pediatric practice will be able to get tax 
credits for her employees to provide health care and that she will be 
able to add another nurse practitioner just because this bill provides 
for small businesses.
  So I can only say that this whole question of job loss is shaky, the 
whole question of the Constitution is shakier, and I conclude by saying 
this, and I will be on the floor again tomorrow: The Constitution has 
been misused in this debate. I beg of people to get the Constitution. 
It is quite the opposite. H.R. 2 is unconstitutional, because it 
creates an unequal system in America, a system of unequalness as 
relates to health care. We've lived that way but we have not been able 
to get those who have been most deprived to take this case up all the 
way to the Supreme Court. Why did I not have health insurance? Why does 
my neighbor have it and I don't have it? Well, we are now equalizing. 
With the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we're giving you 
the protection of the Constitution to the 14th Amendment and the Fifth 
Amendment of due process and equal protection. I can't imagine a better 
way to value America than to say that all of us deserve the dignity of 
our flag and our Constitution.
  I thank the gentlelady, Dr. Christensen, for her leadership.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Thank you, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, and thank you 
for tying in to the constitutional issues, because we're going to be 
asked to provide constitutional references for every legislation that 
we introduce and the constitutional issue has been raised over and over 
again and I thank you for addressing that in your remarks.
  I would now like to yield to the gentleman from New York, Congressman 
Meeks.
  Mr. MEEKS. I want to thank the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands. I 
also want to thank the gentlelady from Houston, Texas, Sheila Jackson 
Lee, for that excellent statement on the Constitution and the 14th and 
the Fifth Amendments.
  I am so serious about this issue that on this night when I don't have 
much of a voice, it is important to talk about what is really going on 
here. When you think about the Constitution, the first thing that we 
were doing when we came back in the 112th was the reading of the 
Constitution. The Constitution was really put in place to help and 
protect Americans. It's one thing to read the Constitution. It's 
another thing to live the Constitution. I think the gentlelady put out 
the facts clearly down to the 14th and the Fifth Amendments, this is 
constitutional. I think it is also clearly what the Constitution, what 
the individuals who wrote in 1787, it was a committee of the Federal 
Convention, that it should remind us that the sacred text employs and 
empowers us to provide for and protect the American people.
  What is the most precious thing that one has? Is it money? What is 
the most precious thing? It's called life. Without life, what do we 
have? And what is the most important thing in living a good life? It's 
health. So wouldn't it seem that what would be the most appropriate 
thing to do is that we provide health care for Americans? It is without 
question I think that we can agree, whether we're Democrat or 
Republican, we believe that we have the best country on the planet, in 
the history of the planet. But look at the blemish that history will 
record on our great Nation if we do not provide or give access to 
health care for all Americans. This is a struggle that we have had for 
debate after debate after debate, from President before President 
before President. And finally this Congress did come together in the 
111th Congress and said, we're going to provide health care to 95 
percent of all Americans. No, we're not perfect. The fact of the matter 
is I don't know any bill that has ever been passed in any legislative 
body that is perfect. We've got to work, and in fact we talk about our 
union, to make it a more better union. The health care reform bill 
clearly does that.
  Now the logic to come and to repeal the whole bill confuses me. For 
even the Constitution of the United States of America was not a perfect 
document. Clearly for those of us who happen to be African Americans, 
when the Founding Fathers wrote it, they said we were only three-fifths 
of a human being. Clearly the Constitution didn't give women the right 
to vote. The document itself as it was initially written was flawed. 
But we as a Nation didn't say come and strike the entire Constitution; 
repeal the Constitution. That's not what was done. What we did was we 
said, Let's fix it. Let's look and see where we can agree upon to amend 
it. In fact, there was a small debate on the floor right here which 
Constitution would be read. Would it be the amended version? And that's 
what we talked about, the amended version of the Constitution. That's 
what was read here.
  So where is the logic now where we clearly have the law of the land 
to come and say, get rid of it all? You've clearly heard from the 
gentleman from Georgia and the others that have spoken this evening 
about making sure that there is no individual who's denied health care 
because of a preexisting condition. This bill assures us of that. If 
you have a child under 26 years of age, not working, they can stay on 
their parents' health care. Seniors and the doughnut hole, we fixed 
that.
  So if you've got a serious problem that you want to negotiate and 
talk about that's within this bill that's a problem, that's a flaw, 
that needs to be amended, then I think that as a body we can sit down 
and work together to get that done.
  And so I say when I look at where we are, or ask my staff, for 
example, in my little district in New York, the Sixth Congressional 
District.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from the Virgin 
Islands has expired.
  Mr. MEEKS. Let me just end by saying this.
  Let's make sure that health care is not a privilege for a few but a 
right for the many. Let us make sure that we do not destroy this great 
health care reform bill that's now law.
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank our CBC 
Chair, Emanuel Cleaver and the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands, 
Congresswoman Christensen for anchoring this Special Order in order to 
pursue a very important discussion on the leadership of the 
Congressional Black Caucus and the Health Care Reform.
  We remain committed to our diligent work to be the conscience of the 
Congress, but also to provide dedicated and focused service to the 
citizens and Congressional Districts that have elected us. I hope that 
this discussion will highlight the impact of how the repeal of the 
Affordable Act would impact the American people; particularly, within 
the minority community.
  We know that not all Americans have equal access to health care.
  It is all too unfortunate that persons of low-income, or of diverse 
racial and ethnic backgrounds, and other underserved populations have 
higher rates of disease.
  This same population frequently experience fewer treatment options, 
and reduced access to the care they need.
  Worst of all, minority populations are also less likely to have 
health insurance than the population as a whole.
  But now, because of the Affordable Care Act, minorities can benefit 
from:
  Preventative Care that includes regular screenings, annual wellness 
check-ups, cancer screenings, and immunizations--all at no additional 
cost.

[[Page H252]]

  Care that is coordinated to help patients manage their chronic 
diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, high-blood pressure, cancer, 
and many other ailments that require multiple health teams.
  Training to increase diversity within the health professions so that 
patients have more choice of providers who are racially and ethnically 
diverse. Also, health plans will be required to use language services 
and community outreach in underserved communities.
  Expansion of the health care workforce with increased funding for 
community health centers, which provide comprehensive health care for 
everyone no matter how much they are able to pay.
  Banning insurance companies from discriminating against those 
patients who have been sick. No longer will sick patients be excluded 
from coverage or charged higher premiums. Neither will women have to 
pay higher premiums simply because of their gender.
  I am confident that if we repeal Affordable Care Act, we present a 
grave, unhealthy danger to the lives of our most vulnerable populations 
who need health care most by playing politics.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to revisit the thought of repealing 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by working with eager 
Democrats to continue building a bridge to a healthier America--for 
all.

                       AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, we just heard a remarkable hour of 
problems that were so overblown as to be really not worthy of much 
discussion. But I think the American public really needs to understand 
what this last hour was all about. In fact, the Affordable Health Care 
Act is working. And it's actually working very, very well for millions 
upon millions of Americans.
  I just want to read some facts and then move on to what is really 
going on here, which is an effort to try to leverage the necessity of 
funding the Federal Government, which is something we must do every 
year to provide the money to continue all of the work of the Federal 
Government. They're trying to use that as a lever to gain something 
that they've been unable to do in a Presidential election year.
  The last Presidential election year, the issue of the Affordable 
Health Care Act was front and center, and the American people heard 
more than a year of debate about the Affordable Health Care Act, 
whether it was good or not so good, all the benefits and all of the 
problems that it might be. At the end, in November of last year, the 
American public decisively said that the Affordable Health Care Act and 
President Obama should continue. That was the decision by Americans.
  In the House of Representatives we gained seats on the Democrat side, 
and I think about 2 million more voted Democratic than they voted 
Republican. Although, because of the redistricting and the 
gerrymandering, the House remained in Republican hands.
  Just understand what's going on here. What could not be achieved in 
the democratic process of an election is attempted to be achieved in 
two absolutely critical moments in the annual processing of the Federal 
Government.
  The first moment, which comes up on October 1, is the necessity to 
provide money to carry on all of the tasks of the Federal Government--
the Social Security Administration, the National Parks, and on and on. 
Nearly every aspect of the Federal Government has to be funded every 
year. That is a moment that is now being used as a lever to try to 
achieve what could not be achieved in an election. After all, America 
is a democracy. We make our decisions through the electoral process, 
not by trying to lever, using a critical moment, basically, the funding 
of the American Government.
  Now two or 3 weeks beyond October 1 there will be yet another moment 
of critical importance, and that is the ability of the American 
Government to continue to pay its bills. It's called the debt limit. 
Until 2011, this was a routine process in which the Congress would 
continue to say, Okay, we will increase the debt limit so that we can 
pay our bills.
  It was done during Democrat and Republican administrations routinely. 
There was always some discussion about the debt and the deficit, as it 
should be. In fact, the President, Mr. Obama, when he was in the 
Senate, railed against this issue of deficit. Now he's on the other 
side of that. That often happens.
  But the fact of the matter is that in this process, these two moments 
of time are now being used as a lever to achieve in the legislative 
process what could not be achieved in the electoral process. So much 
for democracy.
  Just a few facts about the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, as it's 
become to be known.
  Nearly 13 million Americans have benefited from over $1.1 billion in 
rebates from insurance companies. I was the insurance commissioner in 
California in 8 years. And I knew then, as I know now, that the 
insurance companies were overcharging the public for their health 
insurance policies. However, I did not have any authority under 
California law to order rebates.
  The Affordable Health Care Act sets up a system that requires the 
insurance companies to pay at least 80 percent of the premium dollar 
for medical services. If they don't, they have to do a rebate. It's the 
law that they want to repeal. That's $1.1 billion.
  Also, 105 million Americans, including 71 million Americans in 
private plans and 34 million seniors in Medicare, have received access 
to free preventative services. Do you want to hold down the cost of 
medical services? Do prevention.
  The Affordable Health Care Act requires that every insurance policy, 
including Medicare, provide a free medical checkup every year. Guess 
what has happened? The cost curve has bent downward. Why? Because 
serious illnesses are either treated or delayed. Diabetes, strokes, and 
heart conditions are analyzed early and treated, reducing the cost of 
health care and, far more important, keeping people alive and healthy.
  Moving on. Thirty million women are receiving free coverage for 
comprehensive women's preventative services, including a well-woman 
visit and diabetes screening. They want to repeal that: 30 million 
American women receiving free diagnostic care. They want to repeal it.
  Seventeen million children with preexisting health conditions can no 
longer be denied coverage. I was the insurance commissioner. I cannot 
tell you the numbers of times that I begged for a law that would 
require insurance companies to continue or to provide insurance for a 
newborn child that had a serious illness, time after time, in 
California. Insurance companies would insure the mother for the 
delivery. And the moment that child was delivered, the child had no 
coverage. Bankruptcies and lack of medical care ensued. Seventeen 
million children will be denied health care coverage if they are 
successful in repealing the Affordable Health Care Act. That's 17 
million children.
  Also, 6.6 million young adults to the age of 26 have taken advantage 
of the ObamaCare law, the Affordable Health Care Act, to stay on their 
parents' health insurance plan. Do you have a kid in college or a kid 
that's graduated from college that's 21 or 22? They can stay on your 
plan. Before the Affordable Care Act, before ObamaCare, they had very 
little opportunity to get insurance. They would have to go out and buy 
their own policy. They were able to stay on their parents' policy. 
That's 6.6 million young adults that will not be insured if they are 
successful in repealing the Affordable Health Care Act.
  Also, 100 million Americans no longer have a lifetime exclusion. 
Previously, most health insurance policies in the United States set a 
limit on the amount of coverage that a person could have during their 
lifetime or in a given year. Now, 100 million Americans no longer have 
a lifetime exclusion, and 100 million Americans are able to get 
comprehensive coverage for the duration of their illness. They want to 
affect the well-being of 100 million Americans.
  You've heard about the senior doughnut hole, the drug coverage. 
Written into the law in 2003, providing drug coverage for seniors--
Medicare part D--was a doughnut hole. You got the first couple of 
thousand dollars covered. After that, 100 percent of the cost had to be 
paid by the seniors.
  The Affordable Health Care Act is shrinking the doughnut hole every

[[Page H5910]]

year. And in another 2 or 3 years, that doughnut hole will be closed, 
providing an extraordinarily important benefit to seniors. I know this 
problem in my communities. Before the Affordable Health Care Act, 
before ObamaCare, seniors would reach that doughnut hole threshold and 
they could not afford to continue to buy their pharmaceutical products. 
So what did they do? Their blood pressure went up, their diabetes was 
not treated, and they became seriously ill.
  They want to repeal the Affordable Health Care Act, and the doughnut 
hole will not be closed if they are successful.
  Shall we continue on?

                              {time}  1230

  In California, on October 1, 4 million Californians for the first 
time will have access to an insurance exchange, a marketplace, a free 
marketplace--which we talk about all the time. But one does not exist 
in California until October 1, where the uninsured in California, 
including this Member of Congress, will be able to go to a rational 
marketplace that lists numerous health care policies, five different 
levels of coverage, all of them uniform, all of them priced, where I 
and 4 million other Californians can select the policy of our choice--
not a government policy, but a private insurance company policy; a 
marketplace, a free market solution to the 40 million Americans that 
are not insured and the 4 million in California that are not insured 
today.
  We rail back and forth, Democrats and Republicans alike, about the 
necessity of a free market. For the first time ever in this Nation, a 
free market, rational market system is established, not only in 
California, but in every State in this Union. And thirty-three State 
Governors have refused to set up a free market rational system called 
an exchange--called an exchange in which insurance companies will lay 
out their policies, lay out their price, lay out their coverages, 
exclusions and the rest; and the public will be able to have price 
information, quality information, and make a choice. That's what's 
called a free market. And they want to repeal it. So what are those 
people to do?
  You know, 435 of us represent the people of America. I spent an hour 
listening to some 20 people who may, in their own mind, believe that 
they're representing their people. But I know, from my experience as 
insurance commissioner in California, that for the first time across 
this Nation, we have the opportunity to have a market system, a health 
insurance market system that is rational, that is sensible, in which 
prices are available, in which quality and multiple products are 
available--not a government-run health system, but rather a market 
system established by this government so that the people of this Nation 
can pick and choose which private policy they want.
  If you're over 65, you can get your Medicare; and you will continue 
to get it with the additional benefits that are in the Affordable Care 
Act. If you're not yet 65 and you happen to have been unemployed at the 
age of 50, prior to the Affordable Care Act you were in the deepest of 
trouble. You were virtually uninsurable. Why? Because you were 50 years 
of age. You were entering that period when you were expensive; you were 
likely to get health issues. Insurance companies routinely 
discriminated against you. If you happen to be a woman, you were in 
even deeper trouble. Those days are gone--unless the Republican Party 
succeeds in repealing, delaying, and defunding the Affordable Care Act.
  The American people have an opportunity today to get insurance--or 
they will on October 1. Exchanges will operate across the country, some 
run by States such as California and New York, where the Governor said 
this makes sense to the people in my State and we're going to do it. 
Others, like Texas and Montana, the Governor said, oh, we don't care 
about our people; therefore, the Federal Government is stepping in to 
set up exchanges.
  Whatever you may have heard over this last hour about a government-
run health care system, it is not true, except if you happen to be on 
Medicare. Medicare is a government-run health insurance program in 
which the delivery is not provided by the government, but provided by a 
multiplicity of health care providers. Individual doctors, groups of 
doctors, hospitals, big health care medical centers such as the 
University of California-San Francisco. Yes, Medicare is a government 
health insurance system; it is not a delivery system. There is one, 
however; it's called the U.S. military. Military hospitals and veterans 
hospitals, those are government delivery systems.
  So whatever you may have heard about the government takeover of 
health care, not true unless you happen to be in the military, a 
veteran, or on Medicare. Even the Medicaid program is State run, not 
run by the Federal Government.
  Oh, there are so many falsehoods. You could fill this entire room 
with the falsehoods that we've heard over the last months. But the 
reality is that the Affordable Health Care Act is good for America. It 
is reducing the inflation rate in health care. We've already seen the 
lowest inflation rate in the last 3 years, since the enactment of the 
Affordable Health Care Act, over the last 25 years.
  So are we going to shut down government so that the opponents who 
failed in an election, who failed in Congress in 2010 to stop the 
Affordable Care Act, failed in the Presidential election, in Senate 
elections, are we going to shut down government so that they can 
leverage something that they could not achieve in an electoral process? 
I don't think so. I don't think the American Government will stand for 
it. I don't think the American people will stand for it.
  I wanted to talk about jobs. I wanted to talk about my district. I 
wanted to talk about the necessity of a farm bill so that there will be 
food on the table for the poor, so that there will be a program that 
the farmers in my district will know what they will face as they begin 
to plant their winter crops. That bill languishes because of this 
process that we're seeing.
  I wanted to talk about a transportation bill that we must write and 
fund so that we can build the infrastructure, so that we can put people 
back to work. But, no, we're caught up here in this process.
  There are things that we need to do in America, and here we are. Here 
we are. This is not good for America. The Affordable Health Care Act is 
good for Americans. And when we provide health insurance for every 
American, we will be a much more just society, and we will have a 
stronger economy. This road is out ahead of us.
  I'm going to be joined by my colleagues. I yield to my colleague, the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson).
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Thank you for sharing this hour with me, 
Representative Garamendi from California, my dear friend.

  Mr. Speaker, who could be against making every American eligible for 
health care insurance? I can't even imagine. So I'm here today to help 
set the record straight about ObamaCare. I'm here to explain what 
ObamaCare means to the people in my community and the people around 
this Nation. And I'm here to explain the truth--the real truth--behind 
the health care reforms that are moving ahead on Tuesday, October 1, 
simply because Obama cares.
  Mr. Speaker, this health reform is about making it easier and cheaper 
to get insurance if you don't have it. It's that simple.
  Our President, Barack Obama, cares and is making health care easier 
to obtain. He cares and is making health care more affordable. 
President Barack Obama cares and is making health care more accessible.
  Now, listen up: if you have Medicare, this does not apply to you. 
This has absolutely nothing to do with you. It will not affect your 
coverage. If you have Medicaid, this does not apply to you. If you have 
a job with health care coverage, this does not apply to you.
  ObamaCare only applies if you do not currently have insurance. You 
will finally have the opportunity to gain protection for your body. You 
will finally find peace of mind. You no longer have to live in fear of 
being bankrupted by a health emergency. You no longer will have to let 
your health suffer by avoiding the doctor. You no longer will have to 
fear for your family going without care.
  Mr. Speaker, there are very simple steps for getting started if 
you're insured. Because Obama cares, you can

[[Page H5911]]

get started with these simple directions. If you have access to the 
Internet, you can get started right away.
  Beginning Tuesday, October 1, Healthcare.gov will give you all the 
information you need to sign up for this program. Once you're there, go 
to the tab that says ``get insurance.''
  Mr. Speaker, this will take you to a page that will explain all the 
insurance marketplaces available to you. You will be able to compare 
all the plans available to you in your area.
  Mr. Speaker, the Internet is the best way to sign up; but if you're 
not comfortable using a computer, ask a friend, or ask a young relative 
to help you survey the choices. Young people know all about computers. 
If you need additional help, you can also call 1-800-318-2596. People 
are available around the clock to offer assistance in more than 150 
languages--and in Miami, that is very important. They can help you 
enroll by mail if you prefer.
  Mr. Speaker, Obama cares so much that there will also be expert 
advisers called ``navigators'' in your community. You can find them at 
community health centers, at the mall, in drugstores, and in many 
places of worship. In some States, traditional insurance agents and 
brokers will be able to help. But remember this: if someone tries to 
charge you money for advice on how to sign up, say ``no'' because it is 
a scam. No one should be charged for assistance in signing up.
  Mr. Speaker, Americans should take their time in completing the 
important task of choosing the right health insurance plan. I know 
sometimes it can take 2 hours to choose the right pair of shoes at the 
mall or 2 hours at the kitchen table to choose the right cable TV plan.

                              {time}  1245

  Be patient. Take your time in choosing the right plan to protect your 
body and your life. You won't regret it.
  Mr. Speaker, Obama cares because health reform is not only about 
making insurance simple, but also making it affordable. Let me just 
give you a couple of examples:
  A self-employed person with a spouse and two children and a household 
income of $33,000 would more than likely not be able to afford 
insurance at all today, but starting Tuesday, October 1, this person 
would be able to get insurance for his entire family for an average of 
$94 per month because of a government subsidy;
  A single mother with three children and a household income of $40,000 
will now be able to insure herself and her children for an average of 
$163 per month through ObamaCare.
  Mr. Speaker, it's affordable and it's essential to be covered. Young 
people under 26 will be able to stay on their parents' plans. For those 
young people without the opportunity to join their parents' plans, it's 
especially important for you to get insurance.
  If you're young, you're statistically more likely to end up in a car 
crash or a motorcycle crash or to experiment with drugs or other risky 
behavior that lands you into trouble. You need insurance as much or 
more than anyone else. You have to pay to insure that car, you have to 
pay to insure that motorcycle, so make sure that you pay a very small 
portion of that first paycheck you earn to insure your precious body.
  Mr. Speaker, no one said this would be easy. There will be challenges 
as the Federal Government implements the new insurance markets in 36 
States in the weeks ahead. But progress is never easy. Nothing this 
important and ambitious is easy. There will be needed tweaking and 
needed corrections. But that was also the case in 1935 when we rolled 
out Social Security and in 1965 when we rolled out Medicare.
  Mr. Speaker, we know that Obama cares because insurance companies can 
no longer deny 17 million children with preexisting conditions their 
health coverage. We know that Obama cares because 105 million Americans 
with life-threatening diseases like cancer no longer have to live in 
fear of maxing out on their lifetime dollar limits on their insurance 
coverage. We know that Obama cares because more than 3 million young 
people up to the age of 26 now have coverage because insurance 
companies can no longer remove them from their parents' plans.
  Yes, Mr. Speaker, we are well on our way to a healthier, more 
financially secure Nation. We refuse, we utterly refuse, to allow 
anyone to damage, repeal, or turn back ObamaCare. It is the law of the 
land and it is here to stay. We will stand up for those who cannot 
stand up for themselves. We will speak out for those who cannot speak 
for themselves. We will do all this and more because President Barack 
Hussein Obama cares. He cares for the people of this Nation.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you very much, Ms. Wilson. Thank you for laying 
out the way in which the Affordable Care Act will benefit and how 
people can use that act, how they can access the exchanges and the 
benefits that are found in it.
  I would like now to call on one of my colleagues from the Midwest, 
Mr. Ryan, if you would care to join us.
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman; I thank the lady.
  This is, obviously, a very important issue for all of us around the 
country--in Ohio, especially. We have a very unique situation going on 
in Ohio. As I heard in the previous Special Order, I heard many members 
of the Tea Party Caucus come up here and talk about how bad the 
Affordable Care Act is, how it is going to end democracy as we know it, 
how the sky is going to fall, and it is troubling, I think, when you 
actually see what the benefits are.
  Let me be the first to say as, I think, even those of us who voted 
for the health care reform, there's a long way to go. We've got a lot 
of work to do. These things aren't easy. This is a very complicated 
situation, a very complicated program to try to cover all 313 million 
Americans, try to drive down health care costs, try to move towards 
more prevention and wellness--very big goals in the United States, 
goals that we can only really achieve if we work together.
  So to have one side trying to destroy what is now law in the United 
States, confirmed by the Supreme Court, passed by the House, the 
Senate, and signed by the President, approved by the Supreme Court, now 
as we try to stand it up, we have people trying to inject into the 
process not a helpful hand, not trying to make it work better, but 
trying to destroy it, trying to add more uncertainty here in the United 
States Congress, even to the brink of wanting to shut down the 
government or default on the credit, the full faith and credit of the 
United States.
  All the polls are saying 60 to 70 percent, maybe in the high 50s, 
most Americans say we do not want you to use shutting down the 
government or defaulting on our debt as a way to try to push back on 
ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act.
  So what I'm saying is we have millions and millions of people--here's 
what really gets me. People walk up on the other side of the aisle, God 
bless them, and they act like prior to 2008-2009 we had a health care 
system that took care of everybody. Everybody was fine with the 
current. No businesses were calling our offices saying: Man, this 
health care is destroying my business; I can't plan ahead. It's a 30 
percent increase this year; it's 70 next year. We get one person sick 
in a small business of 20 or 30 people, we've got to go bankrupt.
  People forget. Millions of Americans. Prior to this health care law, 
1,700 families in my congressional district went bankrupt because of 
health care. So we are not even going to talk about that? Are we going 
to sweep that right under the rug, the kind of suffering that goes on 
in some of our communities? Are we going to drive around the problem 
and close our eyes?
  Everyone says this is a giveaway. This is not a giveaway. This is 
about giving people who go to work every day, sometimes two or three 
jobs, have a sick kid, we are just going to ignore them because we've 
got this bumper sticker on the back of our truck that has four little 
slogans on it and, boy, we can't deviate from that because we will get 
primaried by a Tea Party candidate because we can't check every box 
along the way.

  But, fine, let those 1,700 families go bankrupt. Let that kid with 
cancer and his parents who are at Akron Children's Hospital or some 
other children's hospital around the United States have to deal with 
the fact that they hit their lifetime cap because their child has 
cancer.
  Now, give me a break. Because you've got to stick with that bumper

[[Page H5912]]

sticker, you can't deviate from the bumper sticker that says ``less 
government,'' we want to go back to that great health care system that 
left 40 million people without any health care, that kept driving up 
prices for small businesses, small manufacturers in Ohio.
  We can maintain what is great about the American health care system. 
I represent a district not far from the Cleveland Clinic. We understand 
in northeast Ohio how powerful it is, some aspects of our health care 
system, but there are failures in our health care system, and we are 
here as Members of the United States Congress to try to fix those holes 
in the system and try to help our fellow citizens that may be sick, 
maybe can't afford it, but go to work every day just as hard as 
everyone else.
  I will say, before I kick it to my friend from New York, that I find 
it very interesting that we have some Governors in some of our States, 
Republican Governors in some of our States, conservative Republican 
Governors in some of our States, Tea Party Governors in some of our 
States, one in Ohio was the chair of the Budget Committee during the 
Gingrich revolution, Governor Casey, he makes the exact same arguments 
for expanding Medicaid in Ohio, which he is fighting for, along with 
Governor Brewer out in Arizona and some others. He makes the exact same 
arguments that it is immoral for us to have this level of sickness in 
our society with people not having access to health care, that it 
doesn't make any sense for us to wait for somebody to get so sick and 
then they dump themselves into an emergency room after weeks and weeks 
of sickness ending up there much sicker than they should be. He, as 
well as others, are making the argument that prevention is the way to 
go, wellness is the way to go. I commend these Governors, because it 
makes sense.
  So sit down and work with us to help stand this up to create more 
competition, to make sure that these young children and their families 
don't have to go to bed every night--and this is the last one, now 
trying to take any help we are giving to congressional staffers, which 
is floating around here. I know it's a political hot button. But my 
goodness gracious, we get young people that want to come to Capitol 
Hill, live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, make 
peanuts because they are ambitious and want to get ahead, and we are 
going to say, You are on your own with your health care, too. What are 
we doing? What are we doing? This doesn't make any sense.
  I'm sorry. I'm sorry you don't like President Obama. I'm sorry. I 
don't know what to say. But to come after health care reform where so 
many millions of people are going to benefit. In Ohio, we are saying 6 
out of 10 of the people who are uninsured in Ohio can get health care 
for less than 100 bucks a month. What's wrong with that? What's wrong 
with that?
  I yield to my friend.
  Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative Ryan. Thank you for expressing 
the tone of harshness that has prevailed in this Chamber.
  I don't know if I can remember when a law, a standing law in this 
country, was used as a reason to avoid paying our bills or keeping 
government running. I find it regrettable that we go after the law of 
the land, in this case the Affordable Care Act. They'll reference it as 
ObamaCare, and we will see how long that label stands when the program 
proves successful. It might be removed immediately.
  But, nonetheless, the harshness here is driven after a season, 
season's worth of activity on the Affordable Care Act.

                              {time}  1300

  We have voted for it in both Houses of the Congress and with 
bipartisan support in the Senate. The President stood for reelection, 
and was reelected amidst immense arguments and debates about repeal and 
replace by the opposition, by the candidate for President of the other 
major party. So the people have spoken. Then, when they elected Members 
to the House of Representatives, the cumulative total of votes for the 
Members of this House was, in the majority, calling for Democrats. The 
people have stated they support this. As Senator McCain indicated on 
the floor just this week, there are consequences to elections.
  It's not sinking in--or perhaps it has, but they refuse to allow 
their behavior to end. It's putting themselves first as political 
forces rather than the people, rather than what's in the best interest 
of the people. I'm convinced that this is driven by the fear that this 
ObamaCare, as they call it, will be successful and that this is their 
last effort possible to end the opportunity to provide affordable, 
accessible, quality health care for all. We know it. We see it in our 
States. We see it in Ohio. We see it in California. We see it in 
Florida. We are joined by our friend from Texas, who just visited my 
district this week in Albany, New York, Representative Castro from 
Texas. We see it in our home States. People have a need out there.
  In my case, I can cite some of the stats: 36,000 young people with 
preexisting conditions will not be biased against in having insurance. 
Take it away, why don't you. Take it away, and then put us at risk of 
defaulting with our credit rating. Take it away. Be harsh. We look at 
the 12,000-plus seniors who are receiving discounts for their 
pharmaceutical needs. Take it away, why don't you.
  It's unfair. It's un-American--immoral--to take it away, but we are 
going to use it as a pawn in a device here called ``negotiating'' on 
whether or not the government will continue to run or on whether we 
will keep the doors open and the lights or on whether or not we are 
going to pay our bills. Come on. Working families in this country 
understand it. They roll up their sleeves. They play by the rules. They 
work hard. They expect to taste success. They pay their bills on time, 
and they expect their government to do likewise.
  They don't expect us to put a roadblock in the way that says the law 
of the land--constitutionally tested in the highest Court of the land, 
in the Supreme Court, and that has been given the green light--we're 
going to put that in as a roadblock to stop progress because we know 
the October 1 starting date is quickly arriving. This is grossly unfair 
to the people of this country.
  When I look at the 124,000 seniors who are receiving free 
preventative services, I'm not ready to give that up. Repeal is not an 
answer--improving is an answer, and I will work with you--but we don't 
use this vehicle as a reason to stop government from running or as a 
vehicle from stopping us from paying America's bills. It goes on and 
on. There are 6,200 young people who now qualify to stay on their 
parents' policies for their health care coverage. This is a vast 
improvement. This is allowing the tens of millions of people who have 
been uninsured--and the many who are underinsured--to finally have 
access, connection, to a system.
  Aren't we in this business to respond to the needs of people? Are we 
in the business to take the facts, twist them, present them in a way 
that offers confusion, and only serve for political, partisan purposes?
  I think we can do better than that in this Chamber. We are going to 
work, and we are going to get to that finish line. I am convinced, 
Representative Garamendi, that we are going to stand for justice, for 
what is fairness in our society. Health care is a right. We should see 
it as an American right--the moral compass points in that direction--
and we ought not use it as.."

                  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT: A REBUTTAL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) is recognized 
for 47 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank you, and I thank the 
majority leader for allowing me this opportunity to take the leadership 
hour this evening and, quite honestly, the opportunity to respond to my 
colleague, Representative Frank Pallone, who is a colleague on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee--in fact, the ranking member of the 
Health Subcommittee--as he talked about the benefits of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act. And he spent the last 35, 40 
minutes talking about what a great piece of legislation that was and 
about all of the wonderful things that it has already done.
  Well, I'm going to take my leadership time, Mr. Speaker, to give the 
other side of this viewpoint and to suggest that this is not a good 
bill, that this is not helpful. Certainly my colleagues on the 
Democratic side, when they were in the majority--and 2 years ago this 
coming Friday they passed into law the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare--
they felt like this was the best thing since sliced bread, like this 
was the solution to all of our problems.
  Yet we spent 2 years cramming that bill--literally cramming that 
piece of legislation, all 2,811 pages of it, down the throats of the 
American people when our unemployment rate was 9.5 percent, when 15 
million Americans were out of work and another 15 million were 
underemployed. This was our number one priority, national health 
insurance, a complete government takeover of one-sixth of our economy? 
This is what the Democratic majority in the 109th, 110th Congresses 
have forced upon the American people.
  The gentleman from New Jersey can talk about all the wonderful things 
that have occurred since the passage of ObamaCare. But let me just 
point out some truths that, Mr. Speaker, don't need any adjectives to 
explain. The truth is, there were never 47 million people in this 
country who could not afford health insurance. There may have been 47 
million who didn't have health insurance. But how many million people 
of that 47 million estimate were making more than $50,000 a year? Mr. 
Speaker, how many were making more than $75,000 a year? And how many of 
the 47 million uninsured were in this country illegally? How many were 
eligible for one of our safety-net programs, like Medicaid or the SCHIP 
program for their children, in their respective States? And when you 
crunch all of those numbers, there may have been and may be 15 million 
people in this country who do not have health insurance because they 
can't afford it or because they don't want it. They would rather pay as 
they go.
  Now, I'm not going to stand here and suggest--particularly as a 
physician Member--that that's a wise thing to do. The expression is 
``to go bare'' in regard to health insurance coverage. I wouldn't 
recommend that. But certainly as an individual in this country, the 
land of the free, we have the constitutional right to make that 
decision for ourselves and our families.
  And what the Democratic majority did with ObamaCare, the way they 
made it work, when you cut right to the chase, so they could cover 
people with preexisting conditions, whether they were nearly seniors or 
children, to eliminate yearly or lifetime caps, to provide preventive 
health services that didn't previously exist, the way they did that, 
colleagues--and you know this--they cut $550 billion out of the 
Medicare program. They virtually gutted Medicare Advantage. Twenty 
percent of seniors select Medicare Advantage.
  The title, Mr. Speaker, speaks for itself. It's an advantage because 
that program covers many of these preventive services that the 
gentleman from New Jersey was talking about that are now available 
under ObamaCare. They were available under Medicare Advantage, but now 
that program has been gutted. It's been cut 14 percent per year over a 
10-year period of time. So you rob from Peter to pay Paul.
  And who is Paul? Paul is this 15 million to 20 million that are left 
in that group who have no insurance, many of whom who don't want it. 
And now we have created a whole new entitlement program that we cannot 
afford when 15 million people are out of work and the unemployment 
rate, Mr. Speaker, for--what is it--38 straight months now has been 
above 8 percent. That, despite the fact that the stimulus bill and its 
$875 billion on shovel-ready projects that promised--that promised when 
the unemployment rate was 7.6 percent that this would solve the 
problem, and it would not go above 8 percent. It hasn't been below 8 
percent since we've spent the money.

                              {time}  2120

  So I say to the gentleman from New Jersey and my Democratic 
colleagues in this Chamber, you fiddled for 2 years; you fiddled while 
Rome was burning. And so, yes, now you can beat the drum and celebrate 
the 2-year anniversary of ObamaCare while 60 percent of this country 
continues to tell you they hate it. They hate it. And they're going to 
tell you that loud and clear, as they did 2 years ago. They're going to 
tell you that loud and clear November 6, 2012.
  I take no pleasure in that. I enjoy being in the majority. Mr. 
Speaker enjoys being in the majority. But our responsibility is to the 
American people, especially to our seniors--our moms and dads--and 
those folks who are struggling, who are on a fixed income. But to 
suggest that we're helping them when we cut their program $550 billion, 
to suggest that closing the doughnut hole is a good thing and lowers 
the cost of health care and lowers the cost of prescription drugs, no, 
it doesn't.
  Because what this Federal Government, what Uncle is doing is forcing

[[Page H1494]]

the pharmaceutical industry to pay for that doughnut hole, and to pay 
for it with brand drugs when prior to ObamaCare we were filling that 
doughnut hole with generics.
  And so what is going to happen? This pharmaceutical industry, it's 
whack-a-mole. You squeeze that balloon, it's going to bulge out on 
another side. And it's going to bulge out when they raise the premiums 
for prescription drug coverage for everybody else.
  The gentleman talked about these wonderful exchanges that are going 
to be set up for the people who don't have health insurance. I don't 
object, Mr. Speaker, to the idea of setting up State exchanges. That's 
an idea that's been around for a long time. It didn't just originate 
with ObamaCare. But when you hear my good friend from New Jersey, the 
ranking member of the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce--and 
he certainly should know of what he says--that in these exchanges 
people are going to get a subsidy, in other words, that's a government 
handout. They're going to get a check if they make $75,000 to $80,000 a 
year. You heard him say it. Colleagues, you heard him say it.
  Now, I would like to ask the 700,000 people in the 11th Congressional 
District of Georgia what they think of $70,000, $75,000, $80,000 a year 
and getting a government handout, a subsidy. My people, the people I 
represent, would feel wealthy if they made $75,000 a year, and they 
would not be expecting a government handout.
  What this administration has done with this piece of legislation--Mr. 
Pallone criticized the Republican idea in the Republican budget of 
block-granting the Medicaid program. The Medicaid program, colleagues, 
it's been around since 1965. It's a good program. It's shared between 
the Federal Government and the States. But under ObamaCare, States are 
told that they cannot be innovative in regard to designing a Medicaid 
program that best fits the needs of the citizens of their State.
  It's called maintenance of effort. ObamaCare says to the Governors of 
the respective States: You can't do anything. You can't make any 
changes whatsoever in your Medicaid program. You can't check on 
eligibility. You can't check to make sure that an individual that 
applies is in this country legally. You can't drug-test these 
individuals. You can't do anything to make sure that that program for 
your State is going to those who need it, who are eligible for it, and 
to who deserve it, because of this maintenance of effort restriction 
under ObamaCare.
  Not only do we put handcuffs on the chief executives of our States, 
but we also mandate that they now cover under the Medicaid program 
people up to 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. Prior law, the 
requirement was 100 percent. Yes, some States went above that when 
times were good, when unemployment was 6 percent instead of 9.5 
percent, as it is in my current great State of Georgia. But States 
can't afford to do that.
  But the Federal Government comes along and says, because of 
ObamaCare, we're going to force you to stay where you are. You can make 
no changes. You cannot go down to 115 percent or 100 percent. Oh, no. 
You have to stay at 133 percent. And we are looking at an additional 
cost to the States over the next 10 years of $15 billion.
  That's why this is part of the lawsuit that the Supreme Court will 
hear next week in the 6 hours of testimony--that and this individual 
mandate in ObamaCare that forces individuals to engage in commerce, the 
Federal Government regulating commerce as provided for in article 1, 
section 8, clause 3 of our great Constitution. Oh, no. This says 
whether you are engaging in commerce or not, Mr. Speaker, you have to 
participate.
  I know my colleagues have heard the expression and the comments from 
me and others, What's next? Everybody has to eat broccoli? It's 
absolutely absurd. It's patently absurd for the Federal Government to 
tell people they have to engage in commerce. We understand the 
Constitution and the right constitutionally to regulate existing 
commerce between States, but not to force people.
  So as I have these moments tonight to talk about as a counterpoint to 
Mr. Pallone in regard to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act, Mr. Speaker, it could not be more unaffordable. The CBO just came 
out with a new score. Originally, 2 years ago, that score was something 
like $950 billion and, according to smoke-and-mirror accounting, 
completely paid for. Now the cost--the adjusted cost--is about twice 
that. It's about twice that.

                              {time}  2130

  So it's not the Affordable Care Act but the Patently Un-Affordable 
Care Act. For my colleague to criticize the Republican majority for 
coming forward with a budget that includes a plan to save Medicare and 
Medicaid, legacy programs, programs that our seniors and our poor are 
so dependent on, for us to have a plan to save that and for the 
gentleman from the other side of the aisle to criticize that, I would 
ask him if he were still in the Chamber, and I ask all of my colleagues 
on the Democratic side of the aisle: What is your plan? What is your 
plan to save the Medicaid program? What is your plan to save the 
Medicare program? How many different studies do we need from how many 
different commissions over how many years before we accept the plain, 
hard, cold truth that the hospital trust fund and Medicare program will 
be insolvent at the very latest by the year 2024 and by the earliest at 
the year 2016 as estimated by the Medicare actuaries?
  Nobody denies that. But what are my Democratic friends doing about 
it? Mr. Speaker, they're doing two things. They're whistling past the 
graveyard and they're enacting IPAB, the Independent Payment Advisory 
Board.
  Colleagues, you've heard it all evening as we've discussed the repeal 
of IPAB and H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act. IPAB is 15 unelected bureaucrats--
unelected but appointed by the President, this President--at a salary 
of $176,000 a year for a 6-year term, renewable for another 6. So we're 
stuck with them for 12 years and that fat salary and benefit package so 
they can say, We're going to save Medicare by cutting reimbursement to 
health care providers and prescription drug companies. We can't change 
the age of Medicare eligibility. We can't increase the annual 
deductible or copay. No, we can't do anything, any of those things. We 
can only cut provider reimbursement. Oh, but there's no rationing. It 
says there in that section regarding IPAB that no rationing will occur.
  Well, give me a break. If you cut reimbursement to providers and they 
stop providing the care, then the senior does not get that knee 
replacement and does not get that stent put in. You can spell it any 
way you want to, but, Mr. Speaker, that's rationing. That's rationing. 
And the American people don't want that. Our seniors don't want that. 
That's no compassion.
  You can provide all these preventive services you want to that Mr. 
Pallone was speaking about, and that's fine if you can afford to do it. 
But to suggest that that saves money, it might save an individual life, 
and that's a wonderful thing, but don't stand up here and tell me and 
tell my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that preventive services 
save money. No economist, no health economist would agree with that. It 
doesn't save money. It costs money. And every time you add another 
``free'' preventive service to a program, it's going to increase the 
health insurance premiums for everybody else. These are called 
mandates.
  The gentleman from New Jersey talked about direct access without 
prior approval, whether it's to see your OB GYN doctor, your 
dermatologist, or your general surgeon without having to go through a 
gatekeeper. I understand that. I practiced medicine 31 years. I think 
my colleagues know that. I understand that. But these things definitely 
cost money. They don't save money. I think it's important for people to 
understand that.
  He talked about the wonderful things that have already occurred under 
ObamaCare, allowing adult children--I realize that's a bit of an 
oxymoron, but I've got four of those oxymorons--to allow adult children 
to stay on their parents' health insurance policy until they're 26 
years old without regard to whether or not they're students.
  Now, the prior policy of most health insurance companies, if you were 
over 21 years old, maybe in the third or fourth year of college, then 
you were no longer eligible to be covered under your parents' health 
insurance policy.

[[Page H1495]]

The expectation, of course, is that you would have a job. Well, the 
reason it's so important now to have them covered up to age 26 on their 
parents' health insurance policy is because they have no jobs. And 
that's the thing that this administration and this--now, at least in 
the House of Representatives--Democratic minority, they just don't seem 
to understand that what the American people care about first and 
foremost is a job. They want health insurance, of course they do. If 
they have to, they'll pay for it out of their own pocket. But they've 
got to have a job first. They've got to put food on the table. They've 
got to put clothing on the backs of their children. They have to have 
the pride, dignity, and respect of having a job.
  As we go into these elections this fall, and all 435 of us in this 
body and 100--well, in fact, I guess it's one-third of the other body 
stand for reelection and we elect a 45th--and, indeed, I think we will 
elect a 45th and not reelect the 44th--President of the United States, 
it's going to be based on jobs and the economy. That's the thing that 
this President, since he took office in January of 2009, has just 
totally missed the point of. And really, it started in January of 2007 
with the Democratic majority in this Chamber when we spent another 2 
years wasting time, fiddling while Rome was burning, trying to force 
and cram down the throats of the American people this cap-and-trade 
regime which would have cost every family $2,500 a year in increased 
utility costs. Thank goodness the other body stopped that, because the 
American people didn't want it.
  And they don't want national health care. That's why we voted in this 
body, H.R. 2, to repeal ObamaCare. And that repeal passed in the House 
of Representatives. We finally had a vote in the Senate. We couldn't 
get them to pass a budget. They haven't done that in 3 years. But after 
about a year and a half, we finally got them to vote on repeal of 
ObamaCare. The Democratic majority rejected that.
  So, Mr. Speaker, now we're dealing with plan B, and plan B is to chip 
away at the most egregious aspects of ObamaCare. It would be a mistake 
for us to assume the Supreme Court will strike down that individual 
mandate and will strike down that Medicaid expansion, that unfunded 
mandate, a $12 billion burden placed on the budgets of our respective 
States. I think they will strike it down, but I'm not going to stand 
here in this Chamber holding my breath waiting for that to happen. That 
would be irresponsible. That would not be representing the people of 
the 11th of Georgia the way they deserve to be represented.

                              {time}  2140

  So, we are going to fight. That's what this is all about today and 
the vote tomorrow in regard to repealing IPAB, this Independent Payment 
Advisory Board that literally takes legislative responsibility away 
from the Congress. Talk about unconstitutional; clearly, that is 
unconstitutional.
  We're going to vote it down tomorrow. And we're going to send that to 
the Senate, and I expect Harry Reid and the Democratic majority to do 
the responsible thing. They don't like it either. They don't like it 
either. Let's don't make an election issue out of it. Let's just do the 
right thing for the American people.
  Mr. Speaker, it's been a long day. We have had a lot of discussion on 
the floor of the House of Representatives, a lot of eloquence on both 
sides of the aisle. I feel very strongly that we should respect one 
another, and I think we do. This is not personal, but when you feel 
that you have the right idea, it's your responsibility to stand strong, 
not to pander to anybody, but to stand strong and do the right thing, 
do the right thing for the American people.
  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

[Pages S1873-S1875]
                       AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion about 
the affordable health care act passed by Congress. In fact, just next 
week, across the street, the Supreme Court will take up this bill and 
decide whether it is constitutional. It is an important decision. It is 
one that will affect millions of Americans, and scarcely anyone 
understands the impact of this law and what it means to their daily 
lives.
  The first aspect I wish to speak about is the most controversial 
aspect of it, the so-called individual mandate. What is it? From my 
point of view, it is a basic method of saying to everyone in America: 
You have a personal responsibility. You cannot say you are just not 
going to buy any health insurance; that you don't think you are ever 
going to need it and are not going to worry about it.
  The problem is, of course, those people who make that statement get 
sick. Some of them get involved in accidents. Some go to a doctor and 
are diagnosed with terrible illnesses and diseases that require 
treatment and surgery, and that costs a lot of money. The uninsured 
people show up at hospitals. They are not pushed away; they are invited 
in. They receive the treatment. Then they can't pay for it.
  It turns out that 63 percent of the medical care given to uninsured 
people in America isn't paid for--not by them. It turns out the rest of 
us pay for it. Everyone else in America who has health insurance has to 
pick up the cost for those who did not accept their personal 
responsibility to buy health insurance.
  So, so what? What difference does that make? It makes a difference. 
It adds $1,000 a year to our health insurance program. In other words, 
you and me and everyone with health insurance is subsidizing those 
people who say: Don't mandate anything on me. Don't tell me I have a 
personal responsibility. But when I get sick, you can pay

[[Page S1874]]

for it.That is what the individual mandate comes down to.
  I listen to those who say, well, this is just too darn much 
government to say that people who can afford it need to have health 
insurance. Keep in mind, this health care bill says if people cannot 
afford it--if they are too poor or their income is limited--there is a 
helping hand, not only in the Tax Code but even through Medicaid to 
make sure they have affordable health care insurance which will never 
cost them more than 8 percent of their income. A lot of American 
families would jump at health insurance that would only cost 8 percent 
of their income. But the law says people have to be willing to pay up 
to 8 percent of their income to have health insurance. The reason, of 
course, is if they don't pay, everyone else pays. If they get sick, 
they cost us $116 billion a year in uncompensated health care coverage 
paid for those who do not accept their personal responsibility to buy 
health insurance.
  Ruth Marcus has an article in this morning's Washington Post, and I 
ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2012]

          116 Billion Reasons To Be for the Individual Mandate

                            (By Ruth Marcus)

       The most compelling sentences in the Obama administration's 
     brief defending the constitutionality of the health-care law 
     come early on. ``As a class,'' the brief advises on Page 7, 
     ``the uninsured consumed $116 billion of health-care services 
     in 2008.''
       On the next page, the brief drives the point home: ``In 
     2008, people without insurance did not pay for 63 percent of 
     their health-care costs.''
       Those figures amount to a powerful refutation of the 
     argument that the individual mandate--the requirement that 
     individuals obtain insurance or pay a penalty--exceeds the 
     government's authority to regulate interstate commerce. To 
     me, $116 billion seems like a whole lot of commerce.
       But let's leave the Supreme Court justices to hack their 
     way through the underbrush of the Commerce Clause. Because 
     those numbers are not only relevant to Commerce Clause 
     jurisprudence, they illuminate the fundamental irrationality 
     of public opposition to the individual mandate.
       The mandate is by far the most unpopular feature of a law 
     on which Americans are otherwise evenly divided. A Kaiser 
     Family Foundation poll this month found that two-thirds of 
     those surveyed disliked the mandate. Even among Democrats, a 
     majority (53 percent) opposed the requirement; independents 
     (66 percent) and Republicans (77 percent) were even more 
     hostile.
       Yet this is a provision that the overwhelming majority--
     those with insurance--should support, for the simple reason 
     that these people currently end up footing the bill for much 
     of that $116 billion.
       As the government's brief notes, ``Congress found that this 
     cost-shifting increases the average premium for insured 
     families by more than $1,000 per year.''
       In other words, those worried about having to pay ever-
     higher premiums should be clamoring for the individual 
     mandate, not agitating for repeal.
       Indeed, for all the bristling over the mandate, it will be 
     irrelevant to the 80 percent of non-elderly Americans who 
     already have insurance, either through their employers, 
     government programs, or purchased on their own.
       The biggest real-world risk to these people would be if the 
     court were to overturn the mandate yet allow the rest of the 
     health-care law to remain in place, driving premiums ever 
     upward.
       Amazingly, Republicans have managed to transform the 
     mandate from an exemplar of personal responsibility into the 
     biggest public policy bogeyman of all time.
       The irony of the fight over the mandate is that President 
     Obama was against it before he was for it. During the 2008 
     campaign, one of the signature differences between Obama and 
     Hillary Clinton was that Clinton's health plan included an 
     individual mandate whereas Obama's mandate covered only 
     children.
       Once elected, Obama quickly recognized the inescapable 
     truth: An individual mandate was essential to make the plan 
     work. Without that larger pool of premium-payers, there is no 
     feasible way to require insurance companies to cover all 
     applicants and charge the same amount, regardless of their 
     heath status.
       In part, hostility to the mandate reflects a broader 
     uneasiness with the perceived encroachment of big government.
       In the Kaiser poll, 30 percent of those who opposed the 
     mandate cited government overreach as the biggest reason. Not 
     surprisingly, twice as many Republicans (40 percent) cited 
     that reason as did Democrats (18 percent).
       But opposition to the mandate also stems from the public's 
     failure to understand--or, alternatively, the 
     administration's failure to communicate--basic facts.
       For example, Kaiser found that when people were told that 
     most Americans ``would automatically satisfy the requirement 
     because they already have coverage through their employers,'' 
     favorability toward the mandate nearly doubled, to 61 
     percent.
       Favorable attitudes rose to nearly half when people were 
     told that without the mandate, insurance companies would 
     still be allowed to deny coverage to those who are sick; that 
     without the mandate people would wait until they were sick to 
     purchase insurance, driving up premium costs; or that those 
     unable to afford coverage are exempt.
       ``People don't understand how the mandate works at all and 
     they don't understand why it's there,'' Kaiser's polling 
     director, Mollyann Brodie, told me.
       Brodie suspects that it's too late to change minds. ``This 
     law as a whole has really become a symbolic issue to people 
     and they really aren't open to information,'' she said.
       Maybe, but the administration must keep trying--not only to 
     sell the law's goodies but to explain how the mandate makes 
     them possible. Otherwise, they could end up winning the minds 
     of the justices, yet losing the hearts of the people whose 
     votes they need to keep the law in place.

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this article spells it out. This issue 
of an individual mandate is an issue of personal responsibility. If you 
believe someone should be able to walk away from their responsibility 
to have health coverage they can afford and that their medical bills 
should be your family's responsibility, then cheer on all these folks 
who are saying we are going to repeal ObamaCare. That is what it boils 
down to. Do you want to pay their bills? I don't think we should have 
to. I think everyone in this country should accept that responsibility.
  There are some other aspects of the affordable health care act which 
we don't hear talked about from those who are calling for its repeal. 
Let me tell my colleagues one. Do you have a child graduating from 
college, looking for a job? I have been in that circumstance. My wife 
and I raised three children. Some of them found a job, but it took a 
little while. While they were looking for a job, did you ever say to 
your son or daughter fresh out of college: How about health insurance. 
They probably said to you: Sorry, Mom; sorry, Dad. I can't do that now. 
When I get a job, I will get back to it. But I feel just fine. I feel 
just fine.
  It doesn't work that way, and any responsible parent knows it. So we 
changed the law, and here is what we said: If you have family health 
insurance, it can cover your son or daughter up to the age of 26. That 
expanded the reach of health insurance coverage. It covered these young 
college graduates and young people looking for work so they had that 
protection even when they were unemployed.
  So did it make any difference? Thanks to this provision, 2.5 million 
young people have gained coverage nationwide, and 102,000-plus in my 
State of Illinois. That means for 2.5 million parents, some peace of 
mind, knowing their kids are covered by the family plan. That was part 
of this bill which many Republican Presidential candidates are saying 
they want to repeal. Really? Do you want to explain that to 2.5 million 
families who have the peace of mind that their son or daughter is 
covered with health insurance up to the age of 26?
  How about the seniors paying for their Medicare prescription drug 
bills. There was this doughnut hole, which means if seniors have 
prescription drugs covered by Medicare and they are expensive, they 
will reach a point during the course of a year when they have to go 
into their savings to pay for about $2,000 worth of prescription drugs 
before the government comes back and starts helping them again. We 
started closing that doughnut hole, closing that gap, giving $250 of 
that $2,000 they have to pay back to people in a rebate initially, and 
then providing a discount on drugs for seniors. That is part of 
affordable care. That is part of what the Republicans scream is 
ObamaCare.
  Is it a good idea? Well, just ask 152,000 Medicare recipients in 
Illinois who have received this rebate to help pay for their 
prescription drugs. Ask 144,000 seniors in Illinois who have received a 
50-percent discount on drug costs, and then ask the millions across 
America who have benefited. We are giving people on fixed incomes and 
limited savings a helping hand so they can have the prescription drugs 
they need to be healthy and strong and safe and independent. Is that 
what you want to be when you are a senior? Most of us do, and this bill 
helps.

[[Page S1875]]

  Third, this bill basically covers preventive services. We all know 
the story: Get in and see a doctor for a colonoscopy or a mammogram. 
Early detection and treatment is money saved and lives saved. We 
extended preventive care under Medicare. For 1.3 million Medicare 
recipients in Illinois--just in my State, 1.3 million; more in the 
Presiding Officer's State--they have preventive care now that they 
didn't have before. It means they are likely to stay healthy longer and 
cost less to our health care system. This is another aspect they want 
to repeal, those who are running against the affordable care act, 
running against the health care bill President Obama has pushed for.
  There is also a provision which says insurance companies have to 
spend 80 percent of the premiums they collect--80 percent--on actual 
medical care. They can take 20 percent for profits and administrative 
costs and the like but 80 percent on actual medical care. The State of 
Minnesota already had that on the books, and it worked. So we said 
let's do it nationwide so if premiums go up, it is to reimburse health 
care--not to take out in profits, not to take it out in bonuses, not to 
spend on an advertising budget for an insurance company. That is a big 
change. The insurance companies hate it like the devil hates holy 
water, and the Republican Presidential candidates want to repeal it. I 
think it is a sensible change to ensure coverage and one that we ought 
to protect, not prohibit.
  There are other provisions in this law as well, but one that affects 
me personally and has affected, I am sure, thousands of Americans is 
the question of preexisting conditions. Do you have one? A lot of 
people do. A lot of people don't even know they have one. Sometimes 
insurance companies dream them up. They would deny coverage for health 
insurance if somebody had--get ready--acne, a preexisting condition so 
no coverage. If there is a history of suicide in a family, they would 
deny them health care coverage, preexisting condition.
  Let me just say to every parent listening: Thank the Lord if your 
child doesn't have asthma, diabetes, or something more serious because 
until the affordable care act was passed, that was enough to disqualify 
your child and maybe your family from health insurance coverage. Oh, 
they can't wait to repeal that. They say: Let's repeal ObamaCare. Let's 
get rid of that preexisting condition provision, and let those 
insurance companies deny coverage.
  America, is that what you want? Is that what you are looking for? Is 
that too much government to say to insurance companies: You can't deny 
children under the age of 18 health insurance coverage if they are 
victims of diabetes, if they have had a bout with cancer, if they have 
asthma? Oh, some of these folks are for the Wild West: Get government 
out of my life.
  I will tell my colleagues this: We know sensible regulation of 
insurance coverage gives people peace of mind and gives families a 
chance to know their child with a challenge or a problem is still going 
to get the very best medical care.
  There is something called lifetime limits, which is another change. 
You go to the doctor, and the doctor says: Well, sorry to tell you, but 
you have been diagnosed with a form of cancer. We can treat it. It is 
going to take aggressive chemo, radiation, maybe even surgery. It is 
going to take some time, and it is going to cost some money, but at the 
end of the day we are going to save your life, and you are going to 
live. You are going to live to see your daughter's wedding, and you are 
going to live to see your grandchildren.

  Then you get into it. You say: I am determined, my family is with me. 
I am going to pray for it and get the right outcome.
  Guess what happens. It turns out the cost blows the lid off your 
health insurance coverage. You had a lifetime limit on how much they 
would pay, which you never thought you would use until that diagnosis 
came down. So now we have basically said we are removing lifetime 
limits on health care. That is part of ObamaCare. That is part of the 
affordable care act.
  So I say to my Republican friends and those running for President: 
You want to go to the American Cancer Society and enter into a debate 
with them about whether lifetime limits are the right thing to do? They 
are going to explain to you thousands and thousands of American 
examples of why people with lifetime limits end up in a tragic 
situation where they need more coverage, they need more care. Their 
lives can be saved, but their health care coverage is cut off. That was 
the old days. That was before the affordable care act.
  So those who want to repeal it stand up and get cheering crowds. In 
those cheering crowds are cancer patients. They ought to stop and think 
before they start cheering and know what they are cheering for.
  The affordable care act is a sensible, reasonable step in a direction 
toward containing health care costs and making health care insurance 
coverage fairer for Americans all across our Nation.
  Is it a perfect law? Of course not. As I have said many times, the 
only perfect law I am aware of was carried down a mountain on clay 
tablets by Senator Moses. Ever since, we have done our best. We can 
always do better, and I am open to change, I am open to improvement. 
But for those who want to walk away from the affordable care act, 
listen to what they are walking away from.
  They are imposing a $1,000 premium on families to pay for the 
uninsured who will not accept their personal responsibility to buy 
health insurance. They are walking away from helping seniors pay for 
their Medicare prescription drugs. They are turning their back on 
families with young children fresh out of college looking for jobs, 
with no health insurance coverage. They are inviting the insurance 
companies to once again turn down your child and your family because of 
a preexisting condition. They are saying, once again: Let's get into 
the world of lifetime limits on insurance no matter how much health 
care costs.
  That is their idea of a future--not mine, not my family's. I have 
lived through part of this. Many others have as well. So when you hear 
their cheering crowds about repealing the affordable care act, hoping 
the Supreme Court finds some aspect unconstitutional, step back and ask 
those cheering crowds about their own health insurance.
  The last thing I want to say is this. It is interesting that Senators 
are debating this. You ought to see our health insurance. You ought to 
see what we have as Members of Congress. We have the Federal Employees 
Health Benefits Program. Guess what. It is a government-administered 
program. Oh, my goodness. You mean Republican Senators are part of a 
government-administered health care program? Yes. And you mean to tell 
me they have to deal with an insurance exchange? Yes. That is what the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is.
  Eight million Federal employees and their families choose once a 
year--in my case from nine different plans that cover Illinois. We like 
our coverage in my family. Federal employees like their coverage. 
Senators like their coverage. But when it comes to extending this same 
benefit to every other American, oh, what a horror story; that is too 
much government. Really? If you are a person of principle and believe a 
government-administered health care plan is too much government, step 
up here in the well and tell people: I am giving up my Federal health 
insurance. I have not heard a single Republican Senator say that--not 
one. So let's find out. When we come down to the question about health 
care insurance for all Americans, I think they deserve at least the 
kind of coverage that Members of Congress have.
  Madam President, I yield the floor.

              WHY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MUST BE REPEALED

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Massie). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we're here tonight to talk 
about health care, something that is important to all of us, something 
that we have been discussing in this Chamber for the last few years, 
trying to make health care affordable and accessible to many American 
families.
  A couple of years ago, out of this Chamber, a bill was passed, one 
that many didn't even get a chance to read. But we were told, in 
preparation for that, the American people were told there would be 
tremendous benefits to passing the President's health care law. The 
President of the United States himself said it would cut health care 
costs by $2,500 per family per year.
  We were also told there are a number of benefits, such as no lifetime 
caps, a number of prevention benefits, certainly ones that many of us 
agree with. But to get the benefits of the health care bill, we were 
also told by then-Speaker Pelosi that we had to pass the bill to find 
out what is in it. We have, since then, found out many of the things 
that are in it, and many of those we are still discovering as time goes 
on.
  Tonight we'll discuss what is the Affordable Care Act and many 
aspects of it that concern us deeply, and why it must be repealed, 
because just the good intentions of the bill are not enough. Good 
intentions do not guarantee good results.
  What we will discuss tonight is a study that has told us some 
shocking information: how premiums will go up, on average, 96 percent, 
even more so for young men and for women before retirement.
  We will discuss new findings that show massive premiums increases for 
families, for individuals, for small businesses across the country. To 
many of these Americans, they will wake up, when they get their health 
care bills, and find the Affordable Care Act is not affordable.
  But first, let us review again some of the promises and the reality 
of that Affordable Care Act. To seniors, the President's promised that 
these reforms will not cut your guaranteed benefits. What we've 
discovered is that there were more than $500 billion in cuts to 
Medicare that the administration's own actuary predicts will lead to 
providers no longer accepting Medicare, meaning that doctors that 
seniors have been seeing for a while will simply say, we can no longer 
afford to provide this.
  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that, for 
Medicare Advantage, these cuts ``could lead many plans to limit the 
benefits they offer, raise their premiums, or withdraw from the 
program.''
  It's important to understand that Medicare Advantage is the program 
that provides a wide range of preventative services and disease 
management

[[Page H2640]]

for seniors. The very things that people talked about what we should be 
doing for health care will be omitted. Translation means that Medicare 
savings come from cutting payments to doctors and hospitals.
  We've also known that this Independent Payment Advisory Board is a 
problem, also known as IPAB. This 15-member appointed board of which, 
by law, a majority of them may not be in the health care field, will 
make additional cuts to Medicare without any Congressional approval or 
appeal, unless the House and the Senate pass legislation and the 
President signs it into law. So literally, it would take an act of 
Congress to change some of these aspects that this independent board 
will make decisions on with regard to payments and coverage.
  The President also promised, ``If you like your health care plan, 
you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take 
it away, no matter what.''
  But here are some of the facts we've discovered since the bill has 
passed. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted 3 million 
to 9 million individuals would lose their employer-sponsored coverage. 
McKenzie Consulting actually has come up with much higher numbers, 
saying workers losing their employer coverage could be as high as 80 to 
100 million.
  Over 1,400 waivers had to be granted to employers so they could opt 
out of this legislation. The Health and Human Services Department had 
to grant pardons to large businesses like McDonald's, Universal 
Studios, and labor unions. It is estimated that these waivers cover 3.2 
million people.
  And Speaker Pelosi said the bill would create 400,000 jobs almost 
immediately. Let's look again at the results now that the bill is law. 
The Congressional Budget Office predicted the law will result in 
700,000 additional Americans unemployed, 700,000 additional Americans 
unemployed.
  The National Federation of Independent Business predicted the bill 
will cause a loss of over 1.4 million jobs.
  A new insurance tax will also impact a number of private sector jobs, 
estimated to be between 146,000 to 262,000 jobs, by 2022. And 59 
percent of these job losses come from small businesses, the backbone of 
our Nation's growth, where so many moms and dads and young men and 
women have their jobs and get their start.

                              {time}  1820

  Those small companies, those neighborhood companies, those ones that 
have the big impact, that sponsor everything from the Little League 
games to church events as well, many of these businesses are going to 
say, We just cannot grow and create new jobs. Many worry how they're 
going to keep workers employed. Many worry how they're going to afford 
health care coverage for their workers, and many of those workers are 
wondering if they can keep their job.
  The President also said:

       I can make a firm pledge that under my plan no family 
     making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax 
     increase, not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your 
     capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.

  Let's now talk about the facts.
  There are over $835 billion in taxes that will be passed on to 
families in the form of higher premiums and higher costs. Let's look at 
some of those taxes. There will be an increase in the Medicare payroll 
taxes and an increase in other unearned taxes. These Medicare taxes 
will be a total amount of $317 billion in taxes that people will see 
coming off of their paychecks. Indeed, they will see them on their 
paychecks.
  There's a medical device tax. All those medical devices that doctors 
and dentists use to care for you, that will be a new tax. And even 
though they say this tax will be paid by the manufacturers, those 
taxes, indeed, will be passed on in terms of higher costs. Those 
medical devices so critical for the doctors and nurses to provide good 
health care for you, that will increase their costs.
  There will be a health insurance tax, a health insurance tax on the 
health insurance companies themselves and on the policies. That will be 
$101 billion.
  There will also be the individual mandate tax, saying that if you do 
not have coverage, you will pay an additional tax. That's $55 billion.
  And, of course, if your employer decides to give you a high-level 
health care plan that covers so many of the things that people want in 
terms of their doctors' fees, their hospital stay, dental, other 
medical, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, those may be now labeled as a 
Cadillac plan, and those will be taxed with a 40 percent excise tax 
that each family will have to pay in their health insurance, total 
being about $111 billion on that alone.
  These taxes will indeed cost health care more. There will be higher 
taxes for families who will be paying out of their paycheck. There's no 
escaping this part that even though people were told they will not pay 
higher taxes, indeed they will.
  But now the Energy and Commerce Committee has also done a study, and 
we're going to talk about what's going to happen with premiums in this, 
because the President said that his plan:

       not only guarantees coverage for every American, but brings 
     down the cost of health care and reduces every family's 
     premium by as much as $2,500.

  Even after the bill passed, more promises were made about the 
benefits of the law. In July 2012, President Obama promised that once 
the Affordable Care Act has been ``fully implemented, your premiums 
will go down.'' They have not. In fact, since the Affordable Care Act 
has passed, people have seen their premiums go up by thousands of 
dollars. We now have the data showing premiums, in fact, will go up 
even more, and quite dramatically for millions and millions and 
millions of individuals, families and small businesses across the 
country, and large businesses as well.
  Let me describe the study that the Energy and Commerce Committee 
performed, submitting letters on March 14 of this year from the 
Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.
  We sent 17 health care insurance companies requests on information 
about the Affordable Care Act. We asked them, How would it affect 
premiums? We asked them to tell us the information that they already 
have. What numbers did they come up with? What are their analysts 
telling them already it's going to cost in terms of new premiums?
  We didn't request the companies create new information, and we didn't 
ask them to make anything up. We said very specifically, Tell us what 
you see is going to happen. And we said, Submit your existing analysis 
to us so we can capture the purest representation of the impact of the 
Affordable Care Act. Simply said, what is it going to cost families?
  As insurers are currently filing their applications to participate in 
the exchanges, that prediction phase is over, and now we can find out 
what was in the health care bill and what it will cost families. We 
went straight to the source to find out what it will be for America's 
families, and here is what we found out.
  First of all, we noted that health care is going to cost, on average, 
96 percent more for people who are going to get a new health insurance 
plan, 73 percent more for those keeping their insurance, and as much as 
413 percent more based on age and the plan mandates.

  Now, this is important because what this means, basically, is that 
young men will see a large increase in their health insurance rates. 
Women who are nearing retirement age will also see a large increase in 
their insurance rates. Let's go through what some of the reasons for 
this are.
  What was provided to us, for example, by one actual insurance company 
analysis said that, as you start to look through these cost increases, 
what may be a new business or an existing one for your employer, there 
are several essential benefits. Now, up to this point, people have been 
able to choose a plan based upon its affordability; but instead, what 
it's going to be is all plans have to look the same. Now, in that sense 
they say that that increase can be about 15 percent more.
  Now, in addition, for the minimum coverage, about 8 to 10 percent 
more, there will be other guaranteed issues. Removal of any 
underwriting actions, that will be about another 65 percent to 10 
percent. There will be insurer fees. There will be other things like 
risk adjustment transfer payments, reinsurance risk adjustment, and 
other effects small employers will have.

[[Page H2641]]

Those will also go up by as much as 35 percent.
  There will also be an average start--look at the average starting 
member cost premium per member per month will be $158. And if you're 
just doing it on what's called the bronze level, the very low level, 
which would pay 60 percent premiums, that's about $182 more per month 
up to $200 per month. There are multiple other fees in this.
  Basically, what this comes down to is, for those who are new 
businesses, newly in the plan, 96 percent higher costs; for those who 
have an established one, about 73 percent higher costs; and in some 
levels, as high as 413 percent higher.
  On a broader sense, to look at how much this will cost you, in 45 
States that were analyzed, 35 percent of the market will see a premium 
increase of greater than 30 percent. Now, what we see here, some States 
will be less than 10 percent, some States will be greater than 30 
percent, some will see 20 to 30 percent, and some will be 10 to 20 
percent.
  Let's look at some of the individual States.
  Now, in these States, I'm just going to pick out a few here to 
describe. For example, in the State of Georgia, potential premium 
increases range from 48 to 63 percent in the individual market and 25 
percent in the small group market; meaning, if you're buying on your 
own, it's going to be much higher than if you're in a small group, but 
still it's pretty considerable.
  Indiana, one insurance company said it would be 100 percent increase 
in the small group market. Illinois, potential premium increases from 
27 to 61 percent in the individual market and 25 percent in the small 
group market.
  Look at Nevada, potential premium increases 31 percent; Michigan, 25 
to 88 percent for males, and the individual market with premiums to 
vary greatly throughout the State. In the small group market, an 
estimated 44 percent of plans will see some decrease in some cases and 
other areas seeing an increase.
  In my State of Pennsylvania, there's an average increase of 30 
percent in the individual market and 27 percent in the group market.
  Tennessee, which has already had problems over the years with 
TennCare, will see a potential premium increase of 49 to 54 percent in 
the individual market and 35 percent in the small group market.
  The lists go on and on. We bring this out so the American people can 
understand that when people say, if you thought health care costs were 
expensive, wait until you see what they're costing when they're free, 
quite frankly, there is no free ride on this.
  Now, admittedly, some will have some subsidies on this. About 8 
percent of those will have some level of subsidy, which will help to 
offset some of these costs, but many people will not have these 
subsidies at all.
  At this point, I'd like to ask some of my colleagues up to talk about 
some of these things. On my left is Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito 
of West Virginia to talk about what this means in terms of the costs 
for some employees in her State.

                              {time}  1830

  Mrs. CAPITO. I'd like to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. And 
I'm glad we're talking about this because tomorrow I intend to vote 
again to repeal ObamaCare and put an end to what its lead author 
himself said is a ``train wreck.''
  I'd like to read an email that I received about 2 or 3 weeks ago:

       I own a daycare center (260 children and 73 staff). Been in 
     business 24 years. I just got the info on ObamaCare from my 
     insurance company. The numbers will cause me to close my 
     business. How can my own government do this? I have worked 
     hard to have a first-rate child care center, seldom taking 
     vacations and easily putting in 10 hours a day year-round. I 
     have always done the right thing for my employees and 
     clients. This is so discouraging to me. Is there any way to 
     fix this?

  So I visited the daycare center and talked with the owner of the 
business. If she moves forward and doesn't offer insurance, she is 
going to have to pay $83,000 a year in penalties. She cannot afford 
this.
  So what are her options? She's looking at going from 73 employees 
down to below 50. Well, that's 24 jobs right there that she's talking 
about cutting. But let's think of the further implications of cutting 
24 jobs in a daycare center. It's over 70 children who are no longer 
going to have good, high-quality daycare in her small business. She's 
worked hard for 24 years and she doesn't understand.
  She tells me most of the people in her business now have insurance. 
Those who aren't, because they work at the lower wage scale, are able 
to access Medicaid and have other health care available to them. She's 
very, very discouraged.
  Another business person in my State of West Virginia just sent me his 
tax collection for next year for the ObamaCare health plan. He has 105 
people. His premiums are going to go up $180,000 more a year. His 
annual premium in a small business like this is $788,000-$180,000 more 
than it was the previous year. And this is for a plan that has a $3,000 
deductible, which is going to break the back of a lot of employees in 
his business.
  His change? We heard from the gentleman from Pennsylvania that we 
were promised that premiums would not go up, that it was going to be 
affordable and premiums would come down. His premiums have gone up 30 
percent.
  We've already talked about how many folks across this country are 
going to lose their coverage, how many are going to lose their jobs. 
These are just two small businesses that are thinking about either 
cutting their full-time employees down to part time to try to get under 
the threshold--which means that employee has to go out and find another 
job to supplement the income to be able to have enough income to 
sustain their families.
  We also learned, as the report from the Energy and Commerce Committee 
has stated, that for younger people and people going on the individual 
market, the premiums are going to be 96 percent higher. We've also 
learned that 80 percent of single adults between the ages of 21 and 29, 
with incomes at just $16,500, will pay more for their health care than 
they do today. It's very discouraging to hardworking folks.
  I was reading The Wall Street Journal the other day and saw an op-ed 
by Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who I think played a large role in creating 
ObamaCare. He noted that the exchanges would only work if younger 
Americans decided to participate. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 
just pointed out that the younger working population is the one where 
the premium increase is going to hit the hardest.
  But he further suggests that the President, through the force of his 
popularity with younger Americans--because they voted for him--could 
convince them to sign up for health plans because of the popularity of 
the President. It's difficult to encourage people through a sheer force 
of personality to act against their own economic instincts. I mean, 
we're talking about young people that will go across the street--and 
most people in America that will go across the street--to save a nickel 
on gasoline even if their dad owns the gas station on the other side. 
In my view, this just doesn't even hit reality of what's actually going 
to happen with our young people.
  He further states that health insurance needs to be seen as an 
individual responsibility. You know what? Health insurance right now is 
an individual responsibility in this country. But instead, purchasing 
insurance after January 1 will be a requirement imposed by Big 
Government.
  I have shared the concerns of mine. We've talked about the taxes. As 
I was reading through the renewal summary of the small business that 
has 105, he has three taxes listed here that his insurance company has 
enumerated for him:
  One is the annual fee on health insurance providers called an 
insurance fee. This is a nondeductible excise tax applied on health 
insurance to help finance ObamaCare.

  Number two, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. This 
provides funding for an institute to assist patients, clinicians, 
purchasers and policymakers to make informed health decisions.
  The other is a transitional reinsurance contribution for those who 
are in high-risk pools.
  This is added tax to small businesses, the employers in our country. 
They're

[[Page H2642]]

going to have to make tough choices because it's unaffordable. Even 
paying the penalties is unaffordable, which is going to result, as you 
said, in over 700,000 jobs lost in this country.
  We have a better way to do this, a more patient-centered, market-
based approach where affordability and accessibility are goals that we 
all want. We could have, I think, a much more economical, and probably 
a better health approach because it will have the patient-centered 
doctor/patient relationship in full consideration.
  So I would say to you that I have two concrete examples. I would 
encourage my colleagues throughout--and I'm sure we have--the House and 
Senate to talk to these employers who have over 50 employees to see 
what kind of impact this is going to have. Twenty-four possible people 
losing their jobs in a day care center; 70 children losing after-school 
care. What are those families going to do?
  I tried to help with this business owner to try to help her find 
solutions. I couldn't come up with one because this is getting rammed 
down her throat no matter what.
  So, with that discouraging bit of a small business viewpoint of the 
impact of ObamaCare as it approaches, and with the attitude of some of 
the architects of ObamaCare that it's our responsibility, or because we 
voted for somebody, we are going to work against our own economic 
interests, it just doesn't even pass the laugh test in my opinion. So I 
think we're in for a rough ride.
  I want to thank my colleague for letting me join him on this Special 
Order and all my colleagues here tonight.
  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank my friend from West Virginia, 
whose district borders mine in southwestern Pennsylvania down there.
  But I note and amplify something you said because even when some say, 
well, you know, if you're a business of less than 50 employees it's not 
going to affect you, there are a couple things. Some businesses say, 
well, then, we'll stay under 50 employees. But also, those people are 
still going to have the taxes. They're going to have higher Medicare 
taxes, taxes on their paycheck, they're going to see health care costs 
going up anyway because of the tax on health insurance, tax on 
prescription drugs, and other taxes that go on. So people will still 
see higher costs in this.
  I'd like to call now upon another one of my colleagues from Texas, 
Dr. Burgess, also on the Energy and Commerce Committee, who continues 
to work very hard for the sake of patients to make sure we come up with 
an affordable plan for American families.
  Mr. BURGESS. I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank him for 
holding this hour tonight. It is important that we have this 
discussion.
  We're barely 3 weeks from the third anniversary of that late-night 
congressional session where the Affordable Care Act was passed into 
law. Those of us who were here at the time will remember that this bill 
that became law that was voted on late that night never went through 
our committee. We had a bill that went through our committee, but it 
never saw the light of day. This was a Senate bill that was bounced 
back over to the House, and we were forced to pass it without a single 
hearing, without a markup. It basically just came to us and the 
majority at the time, the Democratic majority, pushed it through.
  When you stop and look at what were the American people telling us 
through the summer of 2009, when we all had those very tense town halls 
in our district, what were people saying to us? Number one, do not mess 
up the system that is working well for 65 or 70 percent of us. Number 
two was, if you're going to do anything at all, can you help us with 
costs? Well, I think we have the answer to those two questions. Number 
one, we have messed the system up for the people who were depending 
upon it, and, the costs are going through the roof.
  But when you analyze what this new data means, the real thrust of the 
cost increases are focused on people who buy in the individual market 
and people who buy in the small group market. All of the rhetoric from 
the summer of 2009, through the fall of 2009, to the spring of 2010 was 
we have to make these changes in our insurance policy. Why? Because we 
have to help these people in the small group market and the individual 
market.

                              {time}  1840

  This is where the problems occurred; but, in fact, we have made those 
problems worse, and they continue to grow in severity day by day.
  Mr. Chairman, I would also point out, the committee staff on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee on our Subcommittee on Oversight, has 
really done an excellent job in compiling this data. We don't get much 
help from the Department of Health and Human Services. When we say we 
need information from you about what the cost structure is going to be 
of this new health care plan, we don't get a lot of help from them.
  So the committee staff goes out, actually writes to people who will 
be in charge of administering the plans for people in the small group 
and the individual market, and then they compile the data. And the data 
that they compiled is all up on the Energy and Commerce Web site, and 
it's startling.
  These are the individuals: the small-group market and the individual 
market. To be sure, the large-group market will be affected, but not 
nearly as much as those people in the small-group and individual 
market. It was those people who ObamaCare was supposed to help in the 
first place, and we've done them the maximum harm.
  So a tip of the hat to the Energy and Commerce staff, particularly 
the staff on the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee. I think 
they've done an excellent job in bringing this information to the 
Congress in a very usable form. Again, I encourage people to look on 
the Energy and Commerce Web site because this is information that can 
directly affect you, your family, your business, your children, and 
literally your health care for the next three decades.
  I wish this thing had never happened. We are going to have a repeal 
vote later this week, and I welcome the chance to do that. This is the 
unfinished business of this Congress, to undo this dreadful law that 
has been visited upon the land.
  But in the meantime, we also need to make people aware of how this 
law is going to affect their lives. It's going to be in a big way: if 
you like what you have, you can keep it--not so much. If you like your 
doctor, you can keep your doctor--not so much. ObamaCare, you're going 
to pay a lot more to get a lot less.
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. BURGESS. Yes, I'll be happy to yield for a question.
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding for a 
question.
  I am looking at the report that you have referenced that people can 
go look at online for themselves, and I notice that your home State of 
Texas has a projected 23 percent premium increase; is that correct?
  Mr. BURGESS. That's my understanding.
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. And I also notice that the report says, 
from the data that was obtained from the insurance companies, that my 
home State of Virginia is going to have a 31 percent premium increase 
in the small group; again, not talking about the large group rates, 
while they will be affected by the taxes.
  Now, I'm just kind of curious. How come Texas is getting off light 
with only a 23 percent increase and Virginia is getting hit with that 
31 percent increase? Can you explain that, or is that just another one 
of the mysteries of ObamaCare?
  Mr. BURGESS. If the gentleman will yield?
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. I will yield to the gentleman.
  Mr. BURGESS. Well, let me assure the gentleman from Virginia, I can 
promise you with absolute certainty that there was no favoritism on the 
part of the Obama administration toward the great State of Texas. If 
anything, Texas seems to be singled out for special consideration on 
some other areas. But perhaps it actually relates to the differences in 
the insurance market and the type of coverage that's sought. I really 
can't explain that 5 or 6 percent discrepancy.
  What I can tell you--and, again, this is with dead certainty--that 
the Obama administration did not--did not--show

[[Page H2643]]

favoritism to the State of Texas or its Governor Perry.
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. If the gentleman will yield further, 
perhaps for a colloquy, I would ask the gentleman if he suspects that 
this is because up to this point in time this has always been a State-
driven market and, therefore, there are some differences between the 
States, but that the vast majority of States, according to this report, 
in the small-group market are going to be facing significant double-
digit increases? Is that his understanding from the report?
  Mr. BURGESS. There are going to be double-digit increases. And, of 
course, as the gentleman is well aware, there are different State 
mandates that have governed the State-regulated insurance market over 
time, and that may result in some of the discrepancy that you're 
seeing.

  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. And I would further ask the gentleman if it 
makes him a little nervous that the folks who are going to be trying to 
get out there and get records and make sure that folks are doing what 
they're supposed to, either paying the tax or buying the insurance, are 
in fact the IRS? That would be the same IRS that we found out for 
political reasons slow-walked and made it difficult for some 
conservative groups, particularly from Texas and other parts of the 
country, to actually get their tax exempt status. Does that make the 
gentleman a little bit nervous?
  Mr. BURGESS. It should concern and make nervous every man, woman, and 
child in this country that the Internal Revenue Service is going to be 
administering their health care in the future. I think that's an 
important point that the gentleman has brought up.
  One other difference, if I may add, between the cost in Texas and the 
cost in Virginia. Do bear in mind that Texas enacted significant 
medical liability reform 10 years ago, and we have seen the benefits of 
that. If there's one thing that was the missing link in the Affordable 
Care Act, it was where was their commitment to reforming the medical 
justice system in this country, which we all know tends to drive costs 
up, and the creation of defensive medicine, which in turn drives costs 
up.
  Texas has a 10-year history now of caps on noneconomic damages in 
medical liability suits. I don't know for certain if that has played a 
role in the lower premium increase in Texas; but if it has, I'm sure 
they'll be happy to take credit for it.
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. I would say to the gentleman that I'm sure 
some of those things have played out, not necessarily the differences 
between Texas and Virginia, because Virginia has a longer history with 
medical malpractice caps. And we, too, have seen that it has helped us 
in many ways in the State of Virginia.
  I would point out to the gentleman, and I doubt that he is aware of 
this, and I don't know the truth or veracity of it, but it is reported 
in the Courthouse News Service, which is a service for lawyers and 
press folks, that in California the IRS has actually been sued because 
they had a search warrant to go in to look at a specific employee's 
financial records. And in the process, according to the allegations 
made by the attorney, Robert Barnes, when they went in, it happened to 
be an insurance company or a company that had medical records--we're 
not sure because it's called a John Doe company--but it had medical 
records for something like 10 million Californians, including everybody 
in the judicial system in California. And notwithstanding the fact that 
they were told those were not financial records of the individual but 
personal medical records and that they were probably violating some

                      HEALTH CARE TO ALL AMERICANS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, they said it couldn't be done, but as 
of yesterday and early this morning, 7,000,041 individuals here in the 
United States accessed and enrolled in the Affordable Care Act.
  Is it working? Do people want health care? Yes, they do. Do they want 
access to the Affordable Care Act? Yes, they do. These numbers will 
probably grow when the State exchanges begin to report their various 
individuals that enrolled under their system.
  In the State of Texas, going all the way from last week until the 
lines around Reliant Stadium, to individuals staying until 10 o'clock 
at the Community of Faith Church, which I was at with Bishop James 
Dixon, to the Harris County Department of Education and 500 or 600 
there, yes, we want affordable care and the Affordable Care Act to give 
health care to all Americans.
  Now, we need to tell the States that you have left out millions of 
those who could benefit from the expanded Medicaid. I ask Governor 
Perry of the State of Texas to stop denying the millions of Texans who 
would be eligible under the expanded Medicaid to have health insurance. 
Stop denying them health insurance. This is a celebration. More will 
come, and it is good to know that the work that was done is benefiting 
Americans.

                ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Instead of approving the Senate-
passed funding bill, House Republicans have placed politics before 
people while important decisions on government funding and the debt 
ceiling await votes.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with excitement to express my support for 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has already 
significantly improved health care for Americans. In my State of Texas, 
families have saved $46.3 million in insurance company refunds. 
Medicare beneficiaries in the doughnut hole have saved $420.7 million 
in prescription drugs. More than 40,000 Americans and 17 million 
American children with preexisting conditions gained insurance coverage 
through the Affordable Care Act. Because of the health insurance 
marketplaces, in my district, about 204,000 individuals will have 
access to quality, affordable health care coverage.
  The Affordable Care Act will grow stronger and expand access to 
quality care for all Americans.

            HEALTH CARE AND COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, during this holiday season, it appears 
that all our fellow Americans are hearing is a sense of pessimism; but 
I rise to talk about the optimism of this Nation and the great strides 
that we have made, particularly as it relates to our seniors.
  The Affordable Care Act has taken the brunt of everybody's criticism. 
My friends on the other side of the aisle are singing a broken record, 
not a Christmas carol.
  It is important to note that seniors have benefited. The Affordable 
Care Act recognizes the financial burdens that seniors face. No group 
has been hit harder by soaring health care costs. But now, under the 
Affordable Care Act, seniors can have preventative care services 
without any copay, coinsurance, or deductible.
  Services like wellness visits, cholesterol testing, and others, sing 
a good song, yet we sing a negative song to those who are lining the 
streets for comprehensive immigration reform. The families who have 
been fasting have been suffering.
  Let's sing a good song for health care and do comprehensive 
immigration reform.

                                                 December 7, 2009.
     Hon. Harry Reid,
     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Senator Reid: The undersigned state and national 
     specialty medical societies are writing you on behalf of more 
     than 92,000 physicians in opposition to passage of the 
     ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (H.R. 3590) 
     and to urge you to draft a more targeted bill that will 
     reform the country's flawed system for financing healthcare, 
     while preserving the best healthcare in the world. While 
     continuance of the status quo is not acceptable, the shifting 
     to the federal government of so much control over medical 
     decisions is not justified. We are therefore united in our 
     resolve to achieve health system reform that empowers 
     patients and preserves the practice of medicine--without 
     creating a huge government bureaucracy.
       H.R. 3590 creates a number of problematic provisions, 
     including:
       The bill undermines the patient-physician relationship and 
     empowers the federal government with even greater authority. 
     Under the bill, 1) employers would be required to provide 
     health insurance or face financial penalties; 2) health 
     insurance packages with government prescribed benefits will 
     be mandatory; 3) doctors would be forced to participate in 
     the flawed Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) or 
     face penalties for nonparticipation; and 4) physicians would 
     have to comply with extensive new reporting requirements 
     related to quality improvement, case management, care 
     coordination, chronic disease management, and use of health 
     information technology.
       The bill is unsustainable from a financial standpoint. It 
     significantly expands Medicaid eligibility, shifting 
     healthcare costs to physicians who are paid below the cost of 
     delivering care and to the states that are already operating 
     under severe budget constraints. It also postpones the start 
     of subsidies for the uninsured long after the government 
     levies new user fees and new taxes to cover expanded coverage 
     and benefits. This ``back-loading'' of new spending makes the 
     long-term costs appear deceptively low.
       The government run community health insurance option 
     eventually will lead to a single-payer, government run 
     healthcare system. Despite the state opt-out provision, the 
     community health insurance option contains the same 
     liabilities (i.e. government-run healthcare) as the public 
     option that was passed by the House of Representatives. Such 
     a system will ultimately limit patient choice and put the 
     government between the doctor and the patient, interfering 
     with patient care decisions.
       Largely unchecked by Congress or the courts, the federal 
     government would have unprecedented authority to change the 
     Medicare program through the new Independent Medicare 
     Advisory Board and the new Center for Medicare & Medicaid 
     Innovation. Specifically, these entities could arbitrarily 
     reduce payments to physicians for valuable, life-saving care 
     for elderly patients, reducing treatment options in a 
     dramatic way.
       The bill is devoid of real medical liability reform 
     measures that reduce costs in proven demonstrable ways. 
     Instead, it contains a ``Sense of the Senate'' encouraging 
     states to develop and test alternatives to the current civil 
     litigation system as a way of addressing the medical 
     liability problem. Given the fact that costs remain a 
     significant concern, Congress should enact reasonable 
     measures to reduce costs. The Congressional Budget Office 
     (CBO) recently confirmed that enacting a comprehensive set of 
     tort reforms will save the federal government $54 billion 
     over 10 years. These savings could help offset increased 
     health insurance premiums (which, according to the CBO, are 
     expected to increase under the bill) or other costs of the 
     bill.
       The temporary one-year SGR ``patch'' to replace the 21.2 
     percent payment cut in 2010 with a 0.5 percent payment 
     increase fails to address the serious underlying problems 
     with the current Medicare physician payment system and 
     compounds the accumulated SGR debt, causing payment cuts of 
     nearly 25 percent in 2011. The CBO has confirmed that a 
     significant reduction in physicians' Medicare payments will 
     reduce beneficiaries' access to services.
       The excise tax on elective cosmetic medical procedures in 
     the bill will not produce the revenue projected. Experience 
     at the state level has demonstrated that this is a failed 
     policy. In addition, this provision is arbitrary, difficult 
     to administer, unfairly puts the physician in the role of tax 
     collector, and raises serious patient confidentiality issues. 
     Physicians strongly oppose the use of provider taxes or fees 
     of any kind to fund healthcare programs or to finance health 
     system reform.
       Our concerns about this legislation also extend to what is 
     not in the bill. The right to privately contract is a 
     touchstone of American freedom and liberty. Patients should 
     have the right to choose their doctor and enter into 
     agreements for the fees for those services without penalty. 
     Current Medicare patients are denied that right. By 
     guaranteeing all patients the right to privately contract 
     with their physicians, without penalty, patients will have 
     greater access to physicians and the government will have 
     budget certainty. Nothing in the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act addresses these fundamental tenets, which 
     we believe are essential components of real health system 
     reform.
       Senator Reid, we are at a critical moment in history. 
     America's physicians deliver the best medical care in the 
     world, yet the systems that have been developed to finance 
     the delivery of that care to patients have failed. With 
     congressional action upon us, we are at a crossroads. One 
     path accepts as ``necessary'' a substantial increase in 
     federal government control over how medical care is delivered 
     and financed. We believe the better path is one that allows 
     patients and physicians to take a more direct role in their 
     healthcare decisions. By encouraging patients to own their 
     health insurance policies and by allowing them to freely 
     exercise their right to privately contract with the physician 
     of their choice, healthcare decisions will be made by 
     patients and physicians and not by the government or other 
     third party payers.
       We urge you to slow down, take a step back, and change the 
     direction of current reform efforts so we get it right for 
     our patients and our profession. We have a prescription for 
     reform that will work for all Americans, and we are happy to 
     share these solutions with you to improve our nation's 
     healthcare system.
       Thank you for considering our views.

                                                 December 1, 2009.
     Hon. Harry Reid,
     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Leader Reid: On behalf of the over 240,000 surgeons 
     and anesthesiologists we represent and the millions of 
     surgical patients we treat each year, the undersigned 19 
     organizations strongly support the need for national health 
     care reform and share the Senate's commitment to make 
     affordable quality health care more accessible to all 
     Americans. As you know, we have been working diligently and 
     in good faith with the Senate during the past year and have 
     provided input at various stages in the process of drafting 
     the Senate's health care reform bill. To this end, we have 
     reviewed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 
     2009.
       As you may recall, on November 4 our coalition sent you a 
     letter outlining a number of serious concerns that needed to 
     be addressed to ensure that any final health care reform 
     package would be built on a solid foundation in the best 
     interest of our patients. Since those concerns have not been 
     adequately addressed, as detailed below, we must oppose the 
     legislation as currently written.
       We oppose:
       Establishment and proposed implementation of an Independent 
     Medicare Advisory Board whose recommendations could become 
     law without congressional action;
       Mandatory participation in a seriously flawed Physician 
     Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) program with penalties 
     for non-participation;
       Budget-neutral bonus payments to primary care physicians 
     and rural general surgeons;
       Creation of a budget-neutral value-based payment modifier 
     which CMS does not have the capability to implement and 
     places the provision on an unrealistic and unachievable 
     timeline;
       Requirement that physicians pay an application fee to cover 
     a background check for participation in Medicare despite 
     already being obligated to meet considerable requirements of 
     training, licensure, and board certification;
       Relying solely on the limited recommendations of the United 
     States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in determining 
     a minimum coverage standard for preventive services and 
     associated cost-sharing protections;
       The so-called ``non-discrimination in health care'' 
     provision that would create patient confusion over greatly 
     differing levels of education, skills and training among 
     health care professionals while inappropriately interjecting 
     civil rights concepts into state scope of practice laws;
       The absence of a permanent fix to Medicare's broken 
     physician payment system and any meaningful proven medical 
     liability reforms; and
       The last-minute addition of the excise tax on elective 
     cosmetic medical procedures. This tax discriminates against 
     women and the middle class. Experience at the state level has 
     demonstrated that it is a failed policy which will not result 
     in the projected revenue. Furthermore, this provision is 
     arbitrary, difficult to administer, unfairly puts the 
     physician in the role of tax collector, and raises serious 
     patient confidentiality issues.
       This bill goes a long way towards realizing the goal of 
     expanding health insurance coverage and takes important steps 
     to improve quality and explore innovative systems for health 
     care delivery. Despite serious concerns, there are several 
     provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
     of 2009 that the surgical community supports, strongly 
     believes are in the best interest of the surgical patients, 
     and should be maintained in any final package. Specifically 
     these include: health insurance market reforms, including the 
     elimination of coverage denials based on preexisting medical 
     conditions and guaranteed availability and renewability of 
     health insurance coverage; strengthening patient access to 
     emergency and trauma care by ensuring the survival of trauma 
     centers, developing regionalized systems of care to optimize 
     patient outcomes, and improving emergency care for children; 
     well-designed clinical comparative effectiveness research, 
     conducted through an independent institute and not used for 
     determining medical necessity or making coverage and payment 
     decisions or recommendations; and the exclusion of ultrasound 
     from the increase in the utilization rate for calculating the 
     payment for imaging services.
       Further, while redistribution of unused residency positions 
     to general surgery is a positive step in addressing the 
     predicted shortage in the surgical workforce, we believe that 
     the Senate should look more broadly at the issue of limits on 
     residency positions for all specialties that work in the 
     surgical setting that are also facing severe workforce 
     problems.
       Finally, we are pleased that you have accepted our 
     suggestion and removed language which would reduce payments 
     to physicians who are found to have the highest utilization 
     of resources--without regard to the acuity of the patient's 
     physical condition or the complexity of the care being 
     provided. We thank you for making this important change.
       While we must oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act as currently written, the surgical coalition is 
     committed to the passage of meaningful and comprehensive 
     health care reform that is in the best interest of our 
     patients. We are committed to working with you to make 
     critical changes that are vital to ensuring that this 
     legislation is based on sound policy, and that it will have a 
     long-term positive impact on patient access to safe and 
     effective high-quality surgical care.

                               Alliance of Specialty Medicine,

                                                 December 2, 2009.
     Hon. Harry Reid,
     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
       Dear Majority Leader Reid: As the Alliance of Specialty 
     Medicine (Alliance), our mission is to advocate for sound 
     federal health care policy that fosters patient access to the 
     highest quality specialty care and improves timely access to 
     high quality medical care for all Americans. As patient and 
     physician advocates, the Alliance believes that true health 
     reform should be enacted through a responsible and 
     transparent process. Over the past year, the Alliance has 
     provided substantive comments on those health reform 
     provisions that concern specialty physicians and patients in 
     their care. We are extremely concerned that your substitute 
     amendment, the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
     Act,'' to H.R. 3590, fails to address our previously 
     mentioned concerns. Therefore, we oppose the substitute 
     amendment in its current form. We stand ready to work with 
     you to address the issues, outlined below, that continue to 
     concern us.


                Physician Payment Update (Section 3101)

       Medicare's sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula needs to 
     be replaced with a permanent, stable mechanism for updating 
     Medicare fees to continue to assure Medicare beneficiary 
     access to high quality care. Rather than come back year after 
     year, providing a short-term fix to this large problem, we 
     must stop utilizing band-aid solutions and establish a new 
     baseline for physician reimbursement. President Obama agreed 
     with that proposal when he sent this year's budget to the 
     Congress. The cost of interim updates to the physician fee 
     schedule should not be shifted to out years, making permanent 
     SGR reform even more difficult, and costly, to achieve. 
     Already, as a result of previous interim updates, physicians 
     currently face a 21% fee reduction beginning in January 2010. 
     Medicare physician payment rates already are below market 
     rates. Therefore, any long-term solution should, at the very 
     least, recognize reasonable inflationary cost increases.


         Value-Based Physician Payment Modifier (Section 3007)

       Rather than create a stable physician payment schedule, 
     Section 3007 would dramatically alter the current payment 
     system by adding a new, untested payment modifier that would 
     redistribute Medicare payments based on quality and 
     geographic cost variation, without a more systematic review 
     of the potential consequences. While the Center for Medicare 
     and Medicaid Services (CMS) has been testing various models 
     in this area, CMS does not have the current capability to 
     implement such a proposal and no valid methodology that 
     incorporates appropriate risk adjustment factors and outcome 
     measures even exists. Furthermore, there are many reasons for 
     geographic cost variation, including differences in 
     population demographics that merit significantly more study 
     before such a measure could be implemented. Therefore, rather 
     than add stability to the physician payment mechanism, the 
     proposal would create yet more instability with an 
     unrealistic and unachievable timeline.
       CMS should be allowed to fully test models for value-based 
     payment and determine which system would achieve maximum 
     benefit before further modification of a flawed Medicare 
     physician payment formula. There is widespread agreement that 
     the current SGR process results in arbitrary and damaging 
     cuts to Medicare physician payment. We cannot achieve a 
     reliable or stable incentive for quality care by modifying 
     arbitrarily--and arbitrarily changing--reimbursement rates. 
     And because this new modifier in Section 3007 would be budget 
     neutral,

[[Page S38]]

     some providers would face the dual blow of arbitrary SGR cuts 
     and neutrality-imposed value-based purchasing cuts.


             Payment Cuts for Specialty Care (Section 5101)

       While we understand the potential need to increase the 
     payment rates of primary care physicians, many surgical and 
     specialty medicine disciplines have faced significant cuts 
     over the years while primary care fees have increased. As 
     Medicare payments have continued their steady decline over 
     the past few years, reimbursement for primary care services 
     has actually increased. For example, CMS recently approved a 
     more than $4 billion increase in the fee schedule for primary 
     care services, as well as a 37 percent increase in one key 
     code used by primary care physicians. In its March 2009 
     report, MedPAC noted that Medicare payments for primary care 
     have increased 10.6 percent between 2006 and 2009. And these 
     changes will continue in the future. Indeed, under the 2010 
     Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, reimbursement for primary 
     care physicians will increase between 2-4 percent.
       While primary care payments have been increasing, specialty 
     care payments have been decreasing. Since 1992, specialists 
     have seen significant reductions in the fees they receive for 
     procedural services. Although modest increases may have been 
     provided for physician services in recent years, they have 
     not kept up with the rate of inflation nor have all 
     physicians seen increases. In fact, many surgical services 
     were cut again in 2008 and a number of specialties are facing 
     additional cuts in 2010 as a result of changes CMS has made 
     in the fee schedule. Specialists continue to lose more ground 
     in the fees they receive for serving Medicare beneficiaries 
     while their practice costs continue to steadily rise. This is 
     particularly troubling because much of the funding for this 
     health care reform proposal already relies on cuts to 
     Medicare and to the physicians that provide those key 
     services. Additional cuts will likely result in decreased 
     patient access to critical health care services. With a 
     shortfall of 49,000 surgeons and other specialists predicted 
     by the year 2025, we can ill-afford to further exacerbate the 
     access to care problem.


           Independent Medicare Advisory Board (Section 3403)

       Congress should retain proper oversight of the process that 
     determines how services are provided under Medicare and not 
     relegate it to another entity. If the goal of a new Advisory 
     Board is to find new ways to eliminate spending in the 
     Medicare program, the end result may well be detrimental to 
     patient care for our nation's elderly. Already, Medicare 
     reimbursement rates are well below market rates for similar 
     services. And yet, the solution seems to be to further 
     ratchet down the costs, without oversight, without care to 
     ensure that our seniors receive the care that they deserve. 
     Further, the construct of the Board seems to selectively 
     exempt certain providers from its purview--placing more 
     pressure to cut Medicare in those areas under its 
     jurisdiction. There is no question we need to improve the 
     Medicare program to make it sustainable well into the future. 
     However, Medicare cannot be ``fixed'' when we do not look at 
     the whole program, but rather, chop it up and force program 
     savings into specific areas, such as provider reimbursement. 
     We certainly understand and appreciate concerns with the 
     rising costs of health care. But this is not the way to 
     approach this problem. Rather than develop a coherent 
     proposal to appropriately address the issue, the proposal 
     contained in the substitute amendment abdicates Congress' 
     fundamental responsibility and instead hopes that others can 
     develop additional solutions and then allows them to be 
     implemented. If we go forward with this process, there will 
     be myriad unintended consequences, including restricting 
     access to important interventions and services for Medicare 
     patients. You should not allow important health care 
     decisions to be made with little clinical expertise, 
     resources or oversight required to ensure that seniors are 
     not placed in jeopardy.


                Medical Liability Reform (Section 6801)

       We remain concerned that the current health care proposal 
     before us does not address our broken medical liability 
     system. Medical liability reform will help achieve health 
     system savings by reducing the incentives for defensive 
     medicine and it will also protect physicians from 
     unaffordable liability premiums. Last fall, President Obama 
     stated in the New England Journal of Medicine that he would 
     be ``open to additional measures to curb malpractice suits 
     and reduce the cost of malpractice insurance.'' Earlier 
     this year, at the American Medical Association's Annual 
     Meeting, the President also noted that we will not be able 
     to implement changes in our health care delivery system 
     that reflect best practices, incentivize excellence and 
     close cost disparities ``if doctors feel like they are 
     constantly looking over their shoulder for fear of 
     lawsuits.'' With a President that understands the need for 
     medical liability reform, we do not understand why your 
     proposal only includes a Sense of the Senate on the topic.
       We would prefer a more comprehensive approach to this dire 
     problem, such as federal medical liability reform based on 
     the California or Texas models, which include, among other 
     things, reasonable limits on non-economic damages. As you are 
     aware the Congressional Budget Office recently scored 
     comprehensive and proven medical liability reforms, similar 
     to those above, as saving the federal government $54 billion 
     over the next decade. In addition to this savings, these 
     reforms will also improve patient access to specialty care, 
     particularly in rural and underserved areas. However, at the 
     very least, we should do something in this area, and there 
     are several bipartisan proposals which we should debate, 
     consider, and then include within a comprehensive health care 
     reform package.


    Excise Tax on Certain Elective Medical Procedures (Section 9017)

       Physicians strongly oppose taxes on distinctive physician 
     services to fund health care programs or to pay for health 
     care reform and we therefore are extremely concerned by the 
     last minute addition of the tax on elective cosmetic surgery 
     and medical procedures. This is a dangerous precedent to set 
     as it places physicians in the role of tax collector, 
     compromises patient safety by encouraging individuals to 
     circumvent the tax by seeking procedures from non-medical 
     personnel or providers in other countries, and jeopardizes 
     patient privacy by opening physician practices up to IRS 
     audits. Furthermore, once in place, we fear that this tax 
     could easily be expanded to other health care services. As 
     demonstrated by New Jersey's experience with a similar tax, 
     the application of such a tax is arbitrary and confusing to 
     administer.


       Provisions Important to Maintain in Any Health Care Reform

       We applaud many of the provisions in your substitute 
     amendment that improve access to health insurance and believe 
     a number of provisions must be included in any meaningful 
     health reform package to improve access to affordable health 
     insurance and assure access to specialty medicine. Those 
     provisions included in your substitute amendment that we 
     believe should be maintained include eliminating pre-existing 
     condition exclusions, providing adequate access to specialty 
     care through the benefit package, addressing rescission of 
     health coverage, ensuring continuity in Medicaid coverage for 
     children who go in and out of the system, and prohibiting 
     annual and lifetime coverage limits.
       In addition, the Alliance is pleased that your legislation 
     includes a provision to expand comparative effectiveness 
     research (CER). Like you, the Alliance believes appropriately 
     designed CER conducted by an independent entity with full 
     participation of all relevant stakeholders should enhance 
     information about treatment options and outcomes for patients 
     and physicians, helping them to choose the care that best 
     meets the individual needs of the patient. CER needs to 
     recognize the diversity, including racial and ethnic 
     diversity, of patient populations and subpopulations and 
     communicate results in ways that reflect the differences in 
     individual patient needs. It should not be a vehicle for 
     making centralized coverage and payment decisions or 
     recommendations.
       The Alliance also appreciates the elimination of a 
     provision which would automatically reduce payment rates by 
     5% for physician services if they are deemed ``outliers'', 
     regardless of patient acuity o.."

               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I believe Congress should reexamine the 
federally mandated medical loss ratios in the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act. Today I will outline four reasons I believe 
consumers will face increased costs, decreased choice, and reduced 
competition.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, PPACA, included a 
provision that requires all health plans to adhere to a medical loss 
ratio, MLR, established in law. The MLR refers to the percentage of 
premium revenues for health insurance plans spent on medical claims. 
Thus, if a plan received $100 of premiums and spent $85 on medical 
claims its MLR would be 85 percent.
  Beginning no later than January 1, 2011, PPACA requires a health 
insurance issuer to provide an annual rebate to each enrollee if the 
ratio of the amount of premium revenue expended by the issuer on 
clinical claims and health quality costs, after accounting for several 
factors such as certain taxes and reinsurance, is less than 85 percent 
in the large group market and 80 percent in the small group and 
individual markets.
  Supporters of PPACA tend to herald the newly created, higher MLR 
requirement as providing ``better value'' for policyholders compared to 
a lower MLR. To the untrained ear, perhaps higher MLRs sound better 
since they force health insurance plans are required to spend a larger 
percentage of each dollar on medical claims.
  Jamie Robinson, a professor in the School of Public Health at the 
University of California at Berkley, noted that numerous organizations 
``have assailed low medical loss ratios as indicators of reduction in 
the quality of care provided to enrollees and sponsored legislation 
mandating minimum ratios.'' However, he rightly concludes that while 
``this is politically the most volatile and analytically the least 
valid use of the statistic.''
  In fact, a close examination of the data suggests there are several 
reasons to be concerned with the one-size-fits-all federally mandated 
MLRs in PPACA. Here are four key reasons why PPACA's MLRs will likely 
negatively impact American consumers and patients.
  First, insurance markets across the country threaten to destabilize. 
During the health reform debate, opponents of the Federal takeover of 
health care warned that the federally mandated MLR could endanger the 
high-quality health coverage many Americans enjoy because it could lead 
to market destabilization in some States. Under PPACA, States are 
permitted to adjust the percentage for the individual market only if 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services grants them a waiver because 
the Secretary determines that the health insurance market would 
otherwise be destabilized. Unsurprisingly, a total of 15 States have 
applied for a waiver from the MLR. This means that nearly one in three 
States has found that the MLR could destabilize their market and 
threaten consumers' coverage.
  A review of the data shows why States are concerned. According to a 
study published in The American Journal of Managed Care, the specific 
impactof the new medical loss rules on the individual health insurance 
market ``has the potential to significantly affect the functioning of 
the individual market for health insurance.'' Using data from the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the study's authors 
``provided state-level estimates of the size and structure of the U.S. 
individual market from 2002 to 2009'' and then ``estimated the number 
of insurers expected to have MLRs below the legislated minimum and 
their corresponding enrollment.'' They found that in 2009, ``29 percent 
of insurer-state observations in the individual market would have [had] 
MLRs below the 80 percent minimum, corresponding to 32 percent of total 
enrollment. Nine states would have atleast one-half of their health 
insurers below the threshold.''
  The study explained the impact in ``member years,'' which requires 
some explanation. Most health insurance policies typically have a 12-
month duration, but individuals can enroll or disenroll on a monthly 
basis. As a result, much of the accounting and actuarial calculations 
that a health insurance plan makes are in member month or year terms. A 
member year is 12 member months and could be one individual or multiple 
persons. For example, if an individual is enrolled for 12 months, that 
is one member year, or if two people are enrolled for just 6 months 
each, that is one member year. The study found that ``if insurers below 
the MLR threshold exit the market, major coverage disruption could 
occur for those in poor health,'' and they ``estimated the range to be 
between 104,624 and 158,736 member-years.'' This empirical analysis 
highlights the huge disruption American consumers may face. As health 
insurers consolidate, stop offering some insurance products, or exit 
the market place altogether, Americans who like the high-quality 
private health plan they have will lose it. This effect would undermine 
the President's promise to Americans that if they like the health care 
plan they have, they could keep it.
  There is a second concern: Instead of consumers receiving ``better 
value,'' consumers face increased costs. Despite often-repeated 
arguments that federally mandated MLRs will result in ``better value'' 
for consumers, there is little substance to back up this claim. The 
assumption behind this claim is that spending more cents of a health 
care dollar directly on care is inherently better. But this may not 
necessarily be the case. University of California, Berkley, professor 
Jamie Robinson has studied the issue of MLRs closely, and he noted in 
Health Affairs that the connection between the MLR and good value is 
not as clear as some would claim. ``The medical loss ratio never was 
and never will be an indicator of clinical quality,'' he said. In fact, 
Professor Robinson explained that ``neither premiums nor expenditures 
by themselves indicate quality of care. More direct measures of quality 
are available, including patient satisfaction surveys, preventive 
services use, and severity-adjusted clinical outcomes. Although each of 
these is limited in scope, they at least shed light on quality of care. 
The medical loss ratio does not.''
  While the MLR cannot guarantee better value for consumers, it can 
lead to higher premium costs. As the Congressional Research Services 
explained,

[[Page S7290]]

the MLR provision in PPACA requires health insurance plans ``to pay 
rebates to their members if a certain percentage of their premiums are 
not spent on medical costs. This provision may provide an incentive for 
health insurance companies to reduce their compensation to and/or 
utilization of producers as they seek to reduce their administrative 
costs in relation to their medical costs.''
  In this scenario, unintended consequences are important to consider. 
For example, an insurer may increase premiums in another product to 
make up for lost revenues in one where a rebate is issued. Also 
insurers may be incentivized to scale back utilization management 
techniques as a result of the MLR requirement. Accordingly the 
underlying medical trend which drives premium costs would increase for 
everyone in the risk pool, therefore leading to higher premiums for all 
consumers who have a health plan with that company.
  Costs for consumers may also increase because of increased fraud in 
the system. Because insurance plans are economically discouraged from 
activities not directly connected to medical care, there is a perverse 
incentive to reduce efforts to police fraud such as conducting 
utilization reviews and data analysis to root out individuals who 
defraud the system. This is such a significant problem that it was 
highlighted in congressional testimony before a House subcommittee 
earlier this year. ``Given the role that health plan fraud prevention 
and detection programs have played in establishing effective models for 
public programs, improved data for law enforcement, and successful 
prevention efforts, we believe the MLR regulation's treatment of such 
programs should be reevaluated,'' said the witness. According to the 
testifying witness, the specific concern is `` the MLR regulation only 
provides a credit for fraud `recoveries'-- i.e., funds that were paid 
out to providers and then recovered under pay and chase' initiatives.'' 
This effectively discourages preventative measures:

       The MLR regulation's treatment of fraud prevention expenses 
     works at cross purposes with new government efforts to 
     emulate successful private sector programs, and it is at odds 
     with the broad recognition by leaders in the private and 
     public sectors that there is a direct link between fraud 
     prevention activities and improved health care quality and 
     outcomes.

  Ironically, this myopic focus on MLRs obscures the best tool to 
evaluate the value of a health insurance product: consumer choice. As 
Professor Robinson explained:

       The best indicator of current and expected future value in 
     a market economy is the willingness of the consumer to 
     purchase and retain the product. In health care, this 
     translates into measures of growth in enrollment and 
     revenues, adjusted for disenrollments and changes in prices. 
     Plans that are growing are offering something for which 
     purchasers are willing to vote with their dollars and 
     consumers are willing to vote with their feet.

  Let me turn to my third concern. Consumers face fewer choices, less 
competition in the marketplace. As noted previously, the MLR threatens 
to destabilize several markets by pushing some health insurance plans 
to stop offering some insurance products, or exit the market place 
altogether. The Congressional Research Service explained this more in 
detail in a memo to Congress. CRS said the MLR ``requirements of PPACA 
will place downward pressures on administrative expenses, including the 
use of insurance producers. Thus, there will be an incentive for 
insurance companies to cut back on the use of producers or reduce their 
commissions in order to rein in their administrative expenses. Some 
observers, including associations of producers, have suggested that the 
regulatory and market changes resulting from PPACA could put producers 
out of business.''
  The very allowance in PPACA for waivers from the MLR provision is a 
tacit admission the one-size-fits-all MLR approach mandated under PPACA 
is neither in the best interest of consumer choice nor competition 
among health plans in many insurance markets across the country. 
President Obama once publicly pushed for a government-run health plan 
under the auspices of more ``choice and competition,'' Unfortunately, 
the controversial health care law he signed is set to reduce choice and 
competition for millions of American consumers.
  Mr. President, finally, the new mlr mandates further the government 
takeover of health care. Much ink has been spilled about the claim that 
PPACA represents a government takeover of health care. In my view, 
there is no disputing this claim. Even before the passage of PPACA, the 
nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a report showing that 
60 percent of health care spending in the United States is controlled 
by State, local, and Federal governments. Now, after passage of the 
controversial health care law, the Federal Government will effectively 
regulate health insurance markets and dictate what types of health 
coverage Americans can buy--even penalizing employers and consumers who 
do not offer or purchase coverage. The law also massively expands the 
Medicaid Program--a program that began as a Federal-State partnership 
but that has evolved into a gimmick-ridden program threatening State 
budgets and too often promising patients coverage while denying them 
access to care. The law also includes hundreds of new powers for the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services and creates dozens of new 
programs that will further interfere in the practice of medicine. Yes, 
the law is a government takeover of health care.
  Interestingly, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned 
that if the MLRs in PPACA were only slightly higher, PPACA would result 
in a complete government takeover of all health insurance. In a 
December 2009 analysis, CBO warned that if the MLRS were 5 percentage 
points higher, all private insurance would become ``an essentially 
governmental program.'' In fact, this CBO analysis--publicized before 
the health care bills became law-- may be one key reason the Democrats 
refrained from pushing for a 90-percent MLR. CBO warned that if a 90-
percent MLR were adopted, ``taken together with the significant 
increase in the Federal government's role in the insurance market under 
the PPACA, such a substantial loss in flexibility would lead CBO to 
conclude that the affected segments of the health insurance market 
should be considered part of the federal budget.'' If the bills' 
authors had, in fact, included a 90-percent MLR, they would have faced 
critics waving a CBO analysis affirming the government takeover of the 
health insurance industry was complete. However, even with this 
determination, CBO appeared to admit that determining at what point a 
high MLR triggers a complete government takeover of the insurance 
industry was not entirely cut and dry. CBO said, ``Setting a precise 
minimum MLR that would trigger such a determination under the PPACA is 
difficult, because MLRs fall along a continuum.''
  Mr. President, in the end though, CBO settled on 90 percent as the 
tipping point, though, as they noted, any ``further expansion of the 
Federal Government's role in the health insurance market would make 
such insurance an essentially governmental program, so that all 
payments related to health insurance policies should be recorded as 
cash flows in the federal budget.'' In other words, this was just about 
as close as the Democrats could get without even CBO admitting it was a 
complete government takeover of the health insurance markets.

                       HONESTY ABOUT HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, my friends across the aisle like to say 
they support small business owners, but other than keeping fact-
checkers employed, Republican leaders are holding back those businesses 
by continuing to make false claims about the Affordable Care Act.
  In my Louisville district, more than 15,000 small businesses could 
qualify for tax credits to help offset the cost of providing health 
insurance for their employees. A small business with 24 employees 
paying average health care costs could receive almost $40,000 a year in 
tax credits right now under the Affordable Care Act, but only 530 out 
of those 15,000 businesses have taken advantage of it. The situation is 
like that across the country.
  Why is that? Could it be that the people they elected to represent 
them in Congress have repeatedly told them that this law is bad for 
business?
  As Members of Congress, I believe it is our responsibility to give 
our constituents an honest and accurate picture of what Federal laws 
and policies will do to affect their lives. And yet more than 2 years 
after the Affordable Care Act became law, Republican leaders continue 
to make false claims about it.
  Mr. Speaker, the small business owners in my district appreciate 
knowing the truth about how Federal laws can benefit them.

                          WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE

  (Ms. CASTOR of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Let's get to the facts on women's health care 
under the Affordable Care Act, which is 2 years old this week.
  First, good news: The Affordable Care Act outlaws discrimination 
based on gender in copayments and premiums for the same coverage. Women 
have generally been charged more for health insurance. A recent report 
shows that more than 90 percent of the best-selling health plans still 
charge women more than men for the same coverage. The Affordable Care 
Act ends that discrimination.
  Second: Women can no longer be denied coverage by an HMO or health 
insurance company because they have a preexisting condition like breast 
cancer that's in remission, because they had a C-section when they 
delivered their child, or even because they had injuries from domestic 
violence.
  Third: Women no longer have to jump through the bureaucratic hoop of 
obtaining permission to see their OB/GYN.
  Fourth: Because prevention works and saves money, women in new health 
insurance plans will automatically be covered for screenings, 
mammograms, colonoscopies, and birth control.
  Finally, health insurance companies can no longer cancel your policy 
if you get sick.
  These are important consumer protections for women across America, 
for our mothers, for our daughters, and for our families.

             EMPLOYER MANDATE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Barr). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 3, 2013, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and to include extraneous materials on the topic of my 
Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from South Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, back last summer when the 
President unilaterally announced that he was going to not enforce the 
employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act, I was quite surprised 
because the next day there was a news article in The New York Times 
about it. Democratic Senator Tom Harkin was quoted in the article. He 
was one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act. He said, speaking 
of the President: This was the law. How can he do that? How can the 
President simply unilaterally choose to ignore the law?
  Our Founders, Mr. Speaker, designed a system of government based upon 
a separation of powers. The legislative branch enacts the laws and the 
executive branch, the President, enforces those laws. They did that to 
protect our very, very fragile freedom. We cannot allow those 
separations to be eroded. One man who can both make the laws and 
enforce the laws is more a monarch than a President.
  Article II, section 3 of the Constitution requires, in part, that the 
President take care to faithfully execute the Nation's laws. In 1792, 
when George Washington was faced with enforcing an unpopular whiskey 
tax, he wrote in a letter that:

       It is my duty to see that these laws are executed. To 
     permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be 
     repugnant to that duty.

  President Obama, on the other hand, has, throughout his 
administration, picked and chosen which laws or parts thereof he wishes 
to enforce. House Resolution 442 would require the House of 
Representatives to institute a lawsuit against the President to comply 
with this article II, section 3 of the Constitution. It lists four 
specific examples where the President has either failed to enforce the 
laws or has gone beyond the laws as written:
  One is the 1-year delay in the employer mandate under ObamaCare, 
which I mentioned earlier;
  Another is the 1-year extension of the substandard insurance 
policies, which by my definition is any insurance policy anybody would 
really want to buy;
  One is the waiving of the work requirements under the welfare laws; 
and
  One is the granting of deferred removal action to illegal aliens.
  Again, one man empowered to both enact the laws and enforce the laws 
is more a monarch than a President. This is not a Republican issue. 
This is not a Democrat issue. It is not a Tea Party action. This is not 
for messaging. H.R. 442 merely recognizes that no American, including 
the President, is above the law.
  What would we say if the next President came in and said, I don't 
like the Affordable Care Act and, therefore, I am not going to enforce 
the individual mandate, which would gut the law? What would we say if 
President Obama or any other President said, I think the top income tax 
rate is too high and, therefore, I am not going to enforce it, or I am 
not going to enforce the lowest income tax rate? What is the difference 
between those situations and what President Obama is doing right now 
not enforcing the employer mandate under ObamaCare? After all, the 
Supreme Court has ruled that the penalties under ObamaCare are a tax.
  What would we say if a President said, I am not going to enforce this 
tax against my friends but I will against my enemies, or I am not going 
to enforce it against my contributors but I will against everybody 
else? What is the difference between that situation and what the 
President has done granting 1,300 unilateral exemptions to different 
groups under the Affordable Care Act?
  If the President is allowed to make the law or to ignore those laws 
passed by Congress, Congress can just go home; there is no need for the 
legislative branch. In fact, when Congress, following the President's 
lead, when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would delay 
the employer mandate for a year, which the President had already 
announced he was going to do unilaterally, the President threatened to 
veto it.

                              {time}  1700

  At this time, I yield to Representative Martha Roby from Alabama.
  Mrs. ROBY. Thank you so much to my colleague from South Carolina. I 
just want to tell you that, as I travel throughout Alabama's Second 
District, the question I get over and over and over again is: What can 
we do about this executive overreach?
  So I rise, Mr. Speaker, today on behalf of the people of Alabama's 
Second Congressional District to lend my support to Mr. Rice's S.T.O.P. 
Resolution in order to stop this overreaching Presidency. I appreciate 
so much the diligent and thorough work of my colleague's on this 
resolution, and I am proud to sign on as a cosponsor.
  In advancing this resolution, we are seeking to finally stop 
constitutional overreaches by the executive branch and restore the 
separation of powers by bringing legal action against the Obama 
administration to compel the judiciary to rein it in. This resolution 
directs a civil action on behalf of the House of Representatives in 
Federal court in the District of Columbia, challenging four unilateral 
Obama administration actions, as have already been explained, that 
blatantly flout constitutional restraints on the executive branch. I am 
going to mention them again:
  Specifically, these include the lifting of the Affordable Care Act's 
mandated requirements on the type of insurance providers can offer; the 
1-year delay of the health care law's employer mandate; the adoption of 
a policy against deporting certain illegal immigrants, which is counter 
to U.S. immigration and naturalization laws; and the decision to waive 
the ``welfare to work'' laws.

[[Page H115]]

  Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration is certainly not the first 
administration to overstep its constitutional authority as, I would 
say, most Presidents in recent history have pushed the limits of 
executive power, but the actions taken in the last few years have been 
especially blatant and egregious. President Obama and his 
administration have recklessly stretched the scope of the executive 
branch, aggressively imposing by administrative rule or regulation what 
they can't achieve legislatively. When I am at home and am talking with 
my constituents about this, we talk particularly about the promulgation 
of rules. It is just a backdoor attempt to get done what the President 
can't get done here in the Congress.
  Amazingly, in some cases, the administration has moved to delay, 
tweak or to otherwise alter the very health care law he pushed to 
enact, all while dismissing legislative proposals that would have had 
the same effect but would have had the benefit of being legal because 
they would have gone through the Halls of Congress. If allowed to stand 
unchecked, such actions present a dangerous threat to our 
constitutional separation of powers.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish this weren't necessary. I wish President Obama 
and his administration had the self-restraint to act within their 
constitutional bounds, but this administration's pattern of 
aggressively overstepping its authorities to implement policy and win 
political battles leaves us no choice to act. Our constitutional 
restraints on government are not always convenient for political or 
policy goals, but they are necessary for preserving the checks and 
balances that ensure this government still derives its authority from 
the people and not the other way around.
  We know that working through the courts can take time, but the 
judicial branch has shown a greater willingness as of late to rein in 
these overreaches from the Obama administration. Two recent decisions 
that are worth noting have already struck down the Obama 
administration's attempts to flout the law and act outside of the 
constitutionally prescribed role of the executive branch.
  One was the lower court's ruling overturning the President's attempt 
to appoint NLRB members without Senate approval, and the other was a 
rare mandamus order from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that 
rejected the administration's attempt to simply not enforce laws 
related to Yucca Mountain and nuclear waste.
  Mr. Speaker, this S.T.O.P. Resolution allows the House of 
Representatives to seek the intervention of the judicial branch to rein 
in these executive abuses and reconstitute the separation of power. I 
hope it also sends a message to the Obama administration that this 
body, as one half of a coequal branch of the United States Government, 
is not going to stand by and watch the erosion of this country's 
constitutional framework.
  Again, a sincere thank you to my colleague from South Carolina for 
taking the lead on this, for showing leadership. I am proud to be able 
to state to the people of Alabama's Second District, when asked ``What 
are you doing about this?,'' that this S.T.O.P. Resolution is a step in 
the right direction. So thank you very much.
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Thank you, Mrs. Roby.
  I yield to my friend and colleague from Utah (Mr. Stewart).
  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague Tom 
Rice for introducing this important resolution. I am proud to stand in 
support of this, and I thank him for giving me a few minutes to discuss 
what is a very, very important issue today.
  My friend knows that I was a writer. Before I came to Congress, I 
wrote a number of books. I spent a lot of time writing about and 
studying this great Nation--about the history of this Nation, about the 
history of the world--and I think I know a little bit about some of 
these things. I think one of the most remarkable but underappreciated 
characteristics of General George Washington, who was, I think, a hero 
for many of us, was his deference to the Continental Congress during 
the American Revolution. Although in many cases he knew what needed to 
be done, he always recognized that he derived his authority--he derived 
all of his power--not from himself but from the Congress, and he 
understood that the Congress was the organization and the body that 
held the power and the keys to a successful government.
  It is a lesson, as we have been discussing here tonight, that, 
unfortunately, this President does not seem to appreciate or to even 
understand.
  Our Founding Fathers made it very clear in the Constitution that the 
responsibility of the President was to take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed--not selectively chosen, not preferred or some of 
them ignored, but faithfully executed. It is his constitutional 
responsibility, but time and time again, we have seen this President as 
he ignores this constitutionally mandated responsibility. He prefers to 
pick and to choose which laws he will enforce.
  I would like to quote eminent Judge Michael McConnell, who recently 
wrote:

       The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which 
     advises the President on legal and constitutional issues, has 
     repeatedly opined that the President may decline to enforce 
     laws he believes are unconstitutional, but these opinions 
     have always insisted that the President has no authority to 
     refuse to enforce a statute which he simply opposes for 
     policy reasons.

  This has become a very troubling trend for this President. As my 
friend has already pointed out, among other examples, he has already 
declined to enforce immigration laws against a large number of illegal 
immigrants. He has chosen not to enforce work requirements that 
Congress mandated as part of the 1990 welfare reform programs, programs 
which had broad bipartisan support and which everyone recognizes were 
very successful. He has chosen to change the congressional requirements 
that States must meet under No Child Left Behind, and in none of these 
cases did he say he believed the laws were unconstitutional. He simply 
disagreed with the policies and so refused to enforce those laws. Now, 
we may or may not agree with the President on the merits of these 
policies, but as an institution, Congress should be extraordinarily 
concerned that the President is usurping our role as legislators, and 
it is setting a very dangerous precedent.

  The President, for example, went to great lengths to convince the 
Supreme Court and other Americans that the Affordable Care Act was, 
indeed, constitutional. He won that battle, which means he should have 
to enforce this law that he argued was constitutional or, if not, come 
to Congress and ask for changes to the law, but over the last few 
months, we have seen numerous delays and exemptions to ObamaCare 
without any input at all from Congress. Now, once again, regardless of 
your views on the merits of ObamaCare, the President's actions should 
make everyone who respects the separation of power and the role of the 
executive very uncomfortable.
  Can you imagine if Governor Romney had been elected President and if, 
on his first day in office, he had said, ``I am going to delay the 
employer mandate''? Do you think any of my colleagues from across the 
aisle would have supported him in that? Imagine if he had said, again 
as was illustrated before, ``I think that the capital gains tax is too 
high. To get our economy going, I am just not going to enforce the 
capital gains tax for a year.'' I mean, if he had done that, heads 
would have exploded all over Washington, DC.
  Why would that have happened? He doesn't have the authority. The 
Constitution forbids it. We have a President, not a king. I don't want 
this President to act that way. I don't want a Republican President to 
act that way. Our Founding Fathers would be horrified if they were 
alive today and were watching what is happening with our Constitution 
and the growing power of the Presidency. This is dangerous, and it is 
demeaning to our democracy, and it simply must stop. I hope the 
President will remember his constitutionally mandated responsibility to 
enforce all laws, not just those laws that he chooses to enforce 
because he agrees with them.
  Mr. Rice, thank you, sir, for drawing attention to this very 
important issue. Thank you for giving me a few moments to share this 
with you here on the floor of the Congress.
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
  I yield to my friend from Georgia (Mr. Woodall).

[[Page H116]]

  Mr. WOODALL. I thank my friend from South Carolina. I appreciate his 
making this time available.
  Mr. Speaker, truth be told, this is a leadership hour, so it tends to 
be Republicans down on the floor when it is a Republican leadership 
hour, and it tends to be Democrats down on the floor when it is a 
Democrat leadership hour, but as my friend Mr. Stewart said so well: 
this is not a Republican problem. This is not a President Barack Obama 
problem. This is a ``we, the people'' problem.
  The concern is not that it is President Barack Obama who is saying 
the Affordable Care Act doesn't have to be enforced. The concern is 
that any President could say that any law doesn't have to be enforced. 
Thomas Jefferson said you are not likely to lose your freedoms through 
rebellion; you are likely to lose them little by little by little by 
little. That is why we all have to stand up together.
  Mr. Rice is a freshman from South Carolina. I have only been here for 
two terms myself. I think about some of the giants of this institution, 
not just of the House but of the Senate as well. I think about one of 
my favorite Democratic Senators, Robert Byrd from West Virginia--a 
champion of article I of the Constitution. He was a Democrat second; he 
was an American first, defending the Constitution against Presidents, 
Republican and Democrat, who would take the people's power from Capitol 
Hill and take it down to the executive branch.
  So I want to ask you now--and it may sound frivolous--if we had 
President Mitt Romney in the White House today and if Mitt Romney were 
deciding the Affordable Care Act did not need to be enforced, would you 
still be here on the floor, asking that Congress go to court to reclaim 
congressional powers? I ask my friend.
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. As you said, Representative Woodall, I am 
an American first and a Republican second, and if the President usurps 
the Constitution, I will call him to task.
  Mr. WOODALL. I confess to you that I went on the Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee--as all of my colleagues know, the 
Oversight and Government Reform Committee is responsible for doing all 
of the oversight over the executive branch--because I was certain Mitt 
Romney was going to win. I said, for far too long, power has been 
leaving the people's hands on Capitol Hill, gravitating down 
Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, and we in a Republican House 
will be able to do oversight over a Republican President and show the 
American people it is not about Republicans and Democrats; it is about 
article I and article II and about following the process, following the 
law, following the Constitution. It matters. It doesn't matter when 
times are good. It matters when things get dicey, when you begin to 
lose those freedoms little by little.

                              {time}  1715

  I want to ask my friend from South Carolina, because we went through 
this with recess appointments, whether or not there was the ability for 
the President to appoint folks of his choosing to various positions 
around the city. And what I read that D.C. court opinion to say is what 
President Obama has done is absolutely outrageous. It cannot possibly 
stand.
  But what Congress allowed President Bush to do and President Clinton 
to do and President Bush before him to do and President Reagan before 
him to do, that was also unconstitutional; and Congress has to step up 
for the powers of the Constitution entrusted in us.
  Is this your understanding?
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Representative Woodall, that is exactly 
what this resolution is intended to do. It is intended for Congress to 
take action to enforce the Constitution.
  Representative Woodall, do you hear from your constituents back home 
when you speak to them that the President is breaking the law, and why 
don't you do something about that?
  I do all the time. I think that is a result of the erosion of 
Congress' power--exactly what you are talking about.
  Mr. WOODALL. We should absolutely have arguments on this floor about 
how much money should be spent on this program versus that program, 
whether or not we should authorize a new issue or do away with an old 
issue. Those are those things that divide us.
  But we should be united, Republican, Democrat, House and Senate, over 
these constitutional issues of where does the people's power reside. 
Because if leaders like you, in the absence of Senator Byrd from West 
Virginia, in the absence of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in the absence of 
some of those greats who formerly preserved the people's power, I don't 
know how it gets preserved.
  I am certain that you face slings and arrows from folks thinking this 
is some sort of partisan stunt: you just don't like this President; you 
just have sour grapes over the last election.
  I have gotten to know you well over your very short time in Congress. 
It is so valuable to me that you put your responsibilities as an 
American first--far above your responsibilities as a Republican--and 
that despite those slings and arrows, the Constitution comes first. It 
may not seem like we need the Constitution to protect us each and every 
day; but when we wake up and realize it is not there, it is going to be 
too late.
  I hope this is something that spreads in a bipartisan way and in a 
bicameral way. We have preserved this Republic, this greatest form of 
government the world has ever known, only because folks have stood up 
when others did not see that necessity.
  We need this. There is the necessity today, and I am grateful to you 
for your leadership.
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Thank you, my friend.
  I yield to my friend from Florida (Mr. Yoho).
  Mr. YOHO. I thank my good friend from South Carolina (Mr. Rice), for 
bringing this resolution forward and for his leadership. This is a very 
important issue not only today, but as Mr. Woodall pointed out here, 
also for the future of our Nation--a constitutional Republic, as you so 
eloquently put it.
  Article II, section 3 of the Constitution specifically requires that 
the President:

       Take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

  This does not allow the President to enforce the laws he likes and 
ignore the laws he doesn't. This clause compels the President to ensure 
that all agencies within his executive branch are carrying out the laws 
created by Congress, the people's arm of government.
  The current administration undermines this body on a near daily 
basis; and if it is allowed to continue to do so, as you pointed out, 
the balance of power will no longer exist. In fact, it is rapidly 
slipping away to one side of the balance scales. It is our duty as 
representatives of the American people to speak out about this. And if 
not us, who? And if not now, when?
  The delay of the employer mandate, the extension of the substandard 
insurance policies, and the grant of the deferred removal action to 
certain illegal immigrants are just but a few examples of the executive 
attempting to legislate without Congress.
  Luckily, the Framers instituted a system of checks and balances. This 
Congress has no choice but to turn to the courts. I offer my strong 
support for Congressman Rice's STOP resolution, H.R. 442, which will 
enable the House to bring a civil action against the executive branch 
and allow future legislators to hold the executive branch accountable.
  I think this is the crux of this and this is the important part of 
this. Because it is for all future Presidents. Again, we have to stand 
up and start defending our Constitution.
  This administration, like others before it, has no problem creating 
mandates for the American people, but cannot seem to follow the most 
important mandate of our Nation: the Constitution.
  If you look at this, this simple little book, it is not an epic in 
volume. You can see it. It is very thin. But yet it is an epic in 
ideology of what free men and free women can do, and they are held 
accountable with their government by this little red book.
  The importance of this issue cannot be overstated. We must address 
this now so that all future Presidents will know that they must abide 
by the Constitution. No President, past or present, Democrat or 
Republican, should ever be exempt from the duties laid out by our 
Founding Fathers.
  That is why I support Congressman Rice's STOP resolution, H.R. 442, 
and I

[[Page H117]]

urge all my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to support this 
resolution for America and for our Constitution.
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Yoho.
  I yield to my friend from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).
  Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina.
  When we left in December to go back to our districts for the 
Christmas weekend, I got home and thought, Okay, the President is going 
to do something with ObamaCare as we get close to Christmas. You just 
know anytime you come up on a holiday, some news gets put out. July 3, 
leading into the 4th of July, was the employer mandate delay. The 
grandfather stunt was pulled leading into Thanksgiving.
  And sure enough, December 19, the Obama administration grants a 
``hardship exemption'' from the individual mandate tax penalty to those 
who have seen their plans canceled due to ObamaCare.
  I don't think any of those plans should have been canceled. I offered 
a bill here, and the House passed something similar, to essentially 
grandfather in those plans. The Federal Government shouldn't be forcing 
people out of plans they like. Certainly, things needed to be done 
there.
  But understand how unfair this is. If you had insurance and your 
policy is canceled, and then the ObamaCare replacements are not 
affordable for you, they are saying, Okay, you are fine. No penalty for 
you. But if you are somebody who couldn't have afforded insurance the 
prior year, and now you are told you are forced to go on these 
ObamaCare exchanges, you still have to pay the tax, even though you may 
have been worse off than some of those other folks.

  Or if you are somebody that had employer coverage last year, and now 
maybe going out on your own and you need to buy individual insurance, 
if you end up in the exchanges and you don't find those affordable to 
you, you don't get the same relief.
  When you are talking about arbitrary delays like this, it is 
inherently unfair.
  Now, give the administration some credit. Unlike some of the other 
delays, there is actually a provision in ObamaCare that says people can 
qualify for a hardship exemption from the individual mandate. The 
problem is that in this instance it is ObamaCare itself that 
constitutes the hardship.
  So because ObamaCare is implemented, these people are suffering a 
hardship. Therefore they are exempt from the statute. To me, I think 
that is an abuse of what the statute is supposed to do. Certainly, it 
begs the question, Could you simply delay or grant a suspension of all 
of these provisions of ObamaCare?
  It is interesting because I was reading in the Weekly Standard 
publication, one of the reporters was asking members of the Senate what 
are their limits, what is the principled justification for his conduct.
  And so the reporter asked one Senator:

       How do you determine if the President couldn't do something 
     that it does exceed his authority? Are there any parts of the 
     law that the President does not have the authority to delay 
     or suspend?

  The Senator's response--a Democratic Senator:

       I don't know. I'm not the scholar on that.

  Well, the reporter went to another Democratic Senator and said:

       Are there are any delays the President wouldn't have the 
     authority to make? Could the President potentially suspend 
     the entire law if he wanted to?

  His answer:

       I can't answer a hypothetical.

  The reporter asked again:

       So you can't say if there are any parts of the law he 
     couldn't delay unilaterally?

  The Senator said:

       I can't answer a hypothetical.

  Finally, another Senator told the reporter he doesn't know of any 
legal impediment preventing the executive branch from delaying the 
employer or individual mandates.
  When asked:

       Couldn't a future President just simply come in and suspend 
     the entire law?

  That Senator said:

       I don't want to speculate what a future President might do.

  And so I think those answers, when Senators and the President's own 
party cannot offer any principled justification for the President's 
conduct that would exclude the potential of a President simply delaying 
all provisions of the law, you know that you are not in the realm of 
faithful execution of the law.
  I think it is a challenge. We have talked about it in this Chamber in 
hours like this. We have had hearings in the Judiciary Committee with 
experts--even liberal constitutional law experts--saying that this 
conduct goes beyond what the Founding Fathers intended and what the 
Constitution envisioned.
  I would like to see somebody offer a principled justification for the 
President picking and choosing which parts of the law should be 
enforced and should not be enforced, should be delayed, should be 
suspended, or should be ignored.
  It is interesting, because when you go back and look at the Founding 
Fathers when they created the Constitution, when they created the 
Congress, when they created the executive, at the convention James 
Wilson from Pennsylvania was the one who moved to create a President 
consisting of a single person. And that caused silence in the 
convention hall because they had just rebelled against Britain. And 
although you needed some type of executive power, there were some who 
were a little bit taken aback that you would even have a single 
President, even in a constitutional system. Some of the people said at 
the time that you can't really have a strong President and have a 
republic.
  So this was a huge issue for the Founding Fathers. Clearly, it would 
not have been acceptable to stand up at the Constitutional Convention 
and say, Yes, the President is going to have the authority and duty to 
enforce the laws; but if there are laws he doesn't like, he will be 
able to delay provisions or ignore provisions as he sees fit, as long 
as it is consistent with his overall purpose or political agenda. That 
would not have been acceptable to anybody at the time.
  Can you imagine if when John Adams succeeded George Washington, he 
just started delaying provisions related to the bank of the United 
States or the Jay Treaty? Imagine when Jefferson came in. He ran 
against the Alien and Sedition Act. Some of those were just allowed to 
expire, but they went in and repealed a core portion of the Alien and 
Sedition Act. They didn't just ignore it. The provisions that expired, 
expired; and then they repealed the provisions that were still in 
effect.
  That is the way it is supposed to be done. They would never have 
allowed John Adams or Jefferson to come in and just willy-nilly enforce 
what they wanted to and not enforce what they didn't want to.
  And so part of the frustration of this is Congress is supposed to 
stand up for its authority. I think the House people here realize that 
what the President is doing is not proper constitutional government, 
but the U.S. Senate is just totally out to lunch on this. They are not 
interested in safeguarding their institutional prerogatives, because 
they are putting their political interests ahead of the legislative 
body's authority. That really runs contrary to how the Founders 
envisioned the separation of powers and checks and balances working.
  In Federalist 51 Madison said:

       Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.

  What he meant by that is that, yes, you have separate powers. You 
have an executive, a legislative, and a judicial power. But just 
because you separate them doesn't mean that individual liberties can be 
secure.
  So you have got to give each branch the ability to check the other 
branches. And they were sure they knew people would have different 
partisan allegiances and all that, but they were pretty sure that each 
branch would have the wherewithal and would want to defend its own 
prerogatives.
  And so in this instance, I think what you don't have is a Senate that 
is willing to join with the House, use the power of the purse, use the 
appointment power, advise and consent, all the powers that we have, use 
those until the President starts conforming with the law.

[[Page H118]]

  But we are not there yet. And so this idea of trying to bring this in 
front of courts, we shouldn't have to do that. We should be able to 
defend our own turf. But it is frustrating because we don't have a lot 
of other options at this point.
  So I think that my colleague from South Carolina, .."

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. TONKO. This evening we are going to address for the coming hour 
with a couple of our colleagues the issues of affordable health care 
and the fact that we see a pattern here that's established by the House 
that seems to walk away from the needs of a middle class, a working 
class in this society. Our country depends upon a thriving middle 
class, one that is given the respect and the dignity it so much 
deserves. And with the attacks on Social Security with its 76-year old 
history and the efforts to privatize Social Security, we understand 
that that would put at risk a number of people.
  Not a single cent of Social Security was lost to its recipients 
during the very painful recession. And likewise, in the mid-sixties we 
saw the emergence of Medicare, which allowed for, again, the dignity 
factor to be presented and found in the midst of our senior households 
where, at that point in time, prior to Medicare, those who would retire 
would anticipate a decline in their income and their economic security 
simply because of the impact that their health care costs would have on 
their retirement years. Since then, not only have we seen a stronger 
sense of security and stability in those senior households, but we have 
seen a strengthening of the response to the health care needs of our 
seniors because of the stability that Medicare produced and the quality 
of the care that has been part and parcel to the Medicare history.
  And so now, in its infancy, the Affordable Care Act is under threats 
with the repeal measure that was just taken on this House floor to undo 
the progress that was achieved for, again, America's health care 
consumers. It is a troubling notion, at best. This hour of discussion 
will be dedicated to the concerns that we have for the economic ripple 
effects that befall the middle class, which needs to be a thriving 
middle class, and the impact of several of these attacks that seem to 
undermine the very foundations upon which security is provided to 
America's great populations.
  So we're concerned. We're concerned about that repeal and what it 
means, what is removed from the equation of success that was brought 
about a couple of years ago as we worked in a bipartisan, bicameral way 
with the White House to make certain that a growing need out there that 
found this country as the only industrialized nation to not have a 
universal health care program, when that is put at risk again because 
of the efforts to repeal.
  We are joined by my colleague from California, Representative John 
Garamendi.
  John, you witnessed this vote just now to repeal health care. The 
Affordable Care Act was providing hope and opportunity and promise to 
all generations in this American mosaic. It is a tragic moment.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, thank you so very much. And thank you for 
beginning this discussion by going back into the history of the United 
States back to the development of Social Security and the extraordinary 
benefit that that has brought to not only seniors but to their 
children, to families, knowing that when retirement age approached--
65--there would be a foundation for whatever retirement program a 
person would have, and also for pointing out that for years now, and 
certainly in the recent decade, our Republican colleagues have called 
for the privatization of Social Security.
  Now if you trust Wall Street, then I guess it's a good idea. If we 
had any lesson, we should have had the lesson of 2008 and 2009, when 
Wall Street turned its back on the American public and simply ripped us 
off to a fare-thee-well and nearly collapsed the world economy. Were it 
not for the efforts of the Obama administration and, frankly, this 
Congress, it may very well have happened.

  And then you pointed out Medicare coming along in 1964, 1965 and the 
way in which that has protected seniors. I remember as a young child--I 
think I was probably 7 or 8--my dad took me down to the county hospital 
to visit one of our neighbor ranchers. I've got to tell you it was 
horrible. That was the only care available for a senior who had no 
money. And then Medicare came along, and 60 percent of America's 
seniors were in poverty prior to Medicare. Now, with Social Security 
and Medicare, it's somewhere around 10, 15 percent. An enormous boost. 
Yet twice this House has voted to terminate Medicare. Not the 
Democrats. Our Republican colleagues twice have voted to terminate 
Medicare so that every American less than 55 years of age would not 
receive Medicare. They would be given a voucher and told to go fight as 
best they could in the private insurance market.
  And then today, another major effort by the Democrats to provide 
health care for all Americans--a health insurance policy that you knew 
was there, that you could count on, that would be affordable. The 31st 
time, today, a full repeal or a partial repeal was taken up and passed 
by our Republican colleagues.
  So what's an American to do? What does it mean to Americans? Let's 
spend some time talking about what this means to Americans if you 
didn't have Medicare. If you don't have the Affordable Care Act, what 
would it mean?
  I'm going to start, if I might, or would you like to start?
  Mr. TONKO. Absolutely. We, I know, are joined by some of our 
colleagues. But if you want to go through your chart.

[[Page H4812]]

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Let me just take up the Patient's Bill of Rights very, 
very quickly. I was the insurance commissioner in California for 8 
years. The insurance industry puts people behind profits. Profits 
before people. And they're concerned about making sure that they have a 
healthy group of customers. They don't want sick people. Sick people 
cost money. So over the years they have developed a whole set of 
discriminatory practices to exclude from coverage people they don't 
want to take care of because they might be expensive.
  So in the Affordable Care Act there is the Patient's Bill of Rights 
that forces the insurance companies to end insurance discrimination. 
And here's just some of them:
  Children with preexisting conditions. An example, my chief of staff, 
his son was covered by insurance the day he was born. The second day of 
his life they discovered that kid had very serious renal failure; 
kidney failure. Bam, the insurance was over. That family was off their 
insurance policy; gone, done. No longer. We're talking about I think 14 
million American children that are going to get coverage regardless of 
what their health circumstances might be.
  Young adults. This one is close to home. I've got six children. Every 
one of them have passed through that age of 21 when they were no longer 
on our insurance policy. Most recently, my daughter. Twenty-one years 
of age, covered by an insurance company for 21 years and 9 months. The 
day of her 21st birthday, off the insurance policy. We're now talking 
about every young American 21 to 26 stays on their parents' health 
policy.
  She also happens to be a woman. Women are discriminated against in 
insurance because they have a preexisting condition: They could get 
pregnant. That's expensive. We don't want to cover them, say the 
insurance companies. No, no. Under the Patient's Bill of Rights, the 
discrimination against every woman in America on their insurance policy 
is over. Apparently, our Republican colleagues don't care about these 
very, very important efforts to end insurance discrimination.
  We can go on here. Seniors. Who among us doesn't have a preexisting 
condition? High blood pressure, juvenile diabetics, type II diabetes. 
Try to get insurance without the Affordable Care Act--you're out of 
luck. You won't get insurance.

                              {time}  1630

  So the Patient's Bill of Rights, should today's action become law, is 
repealed, and along with it, the protections that 315 million Americans 
presently have--presently have. No more insurance discrimination. The 
ability to get insurance is guaranteed. No more discrimination.
  Yes, I'm a little passionate about this one because I've watched 
this. I've watched this as insurance commissioner. I fought the 
insurance companies day in and day out as they denied coverage, as they 
refused to provide the coverage, as they told people they couldn't get 
care. But the law is in place now. The law is in place, and it's going 
to stay in place despite the vote today.
  Mr. Tonko, thank you.
  Mr. TONKO. And interestingly, Representative Garamendi, we've been 
reminded I think by the general public that the legislature, the 
legislative body here, Congress, took up the bill. They passed it. It 
went over to the President. He signed it. The highest court in the 
land, a conservative-leaning court, reviewed it, made their decision 
and rendered a decision that said it met with constitutionality.
  People are saying go forward. Move on. Get to the issues that now 
have got to be resolved, and that is the economy, creating the jobs, 
producing the post-recession responsiveness that people so much require 
and deserve, and that's where they're at.
  We've been joined by Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton who has 
joined us.
  Representative, thank you for joining us in the Special Order.
  Ms. NORTON. Well, I want to thank you, Representative Tonko, and my 
other good colleague, Representative Garamendi, for leading this 
special order and for offering the perspective that you've begun this 
hour with, something that our fathers and grandfathers are responsible 
for, the Greatest Generation, and now has been embraced by the American 
people. And as proud Democrats, we are very, very proud of that, of 
these very important reforms.
  I wanted to come to the floor as well to offer some real-life, real-
time evidence as people try to judge what they've heard on the floor 
today and what they heard on the floor yesterday about the health care 
bill. We teach our children fair play, you win some, you lose some. And 
when you lose, then you've lost that one; you try again another time.
  What they've seen in the House this year and last year are the 
Republicans trying to repeal financial reform. They lost that. It's as 
if the law of the land weren't the law of the land. Now they're trying 
to repeal health care reform even when the Supreme Court announces the 
law of the land. They've come to the point where they do not recognize 
the law of the land as announced by passage in the Senate and the 
House, signature of the President, and, in the case of the health care 
reform bill, the imprimatur, which is the last word, of the Supreme 
Court.
  But as I heard the debate, I was concerned that the American people 
would be concerned in the face of this economy about what they hear our 
colleagues on the other side say the health care bill will do to the 
economy, and attempt to essentially frighten people, especially 
yesterday when the Republicans came forward with a usual set of 
horribles, this after the bill was passed, now when we ought to be 
thinking of the best ways to implement it. But none of those horribles 
about what was going to happen because of the health care bill was data 
based.
  We ought to ask ourselves: Why would the Republicans not use the one 
existing experience that we have, the 6-year experience of the 
Massachusetts health care law, which is the very model for the health 
care law we passed? And that, of course, was a law that was engineered 
by their own candidate for President, Mitt Romney.
  Well, I had occasion to look at the experience under that bill 
because, as you may know, our colleagues had hearings all around the 
House yesterday on health care reform as a prelude to the repeal vote 
on the floor. And I was in the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee, and the hearing was on the impact on jobs. Now, if you want 
to scare the American people, tell them that the bill is going to add 
to the problems in their jobs.
  One of the witnesses was a State senator from Massachusetts, who has 
been a State senator for 2 years. He was not in the senate when 
Governor Romney's bill was passed. He is the CEO of Cape Air. That's a 
1,000-employee company. It's a tough business because it's the airline 
business. It's a regional airline. And he had some real-time experience 
for us.
  And I think it's important just to say a few words about what 
Massachusetts Senator Daniel Wolf said who for 6 years served on the 
Federal Reserve Board's Advisory Council of New England, who was board 
chair of one of the largest chambers of commerce in Massachusetts and 
is a trustee of the largest mutual bank in the Cape and Islands region. 
He is a small businessman of the kind we have in mind when we talk 
about small business. This is what he reported: That his premiums 
today--under the Massachusetts bill which this bill, our bill, is 
patterned after--are roughly 3 percent of his company's gross income. 
And to quote him: ``Health care reform has not stifled business.'' 
Since the passage of the Massachusetts health care reform bill, the 
very bill that is the model for our health care bill, this company has 
added 15 percent more Massachusetts-based jobs.
  He talked about premiums. Importantly, he said that just before the 
passage of the Massachusetts law, premiums were going up 15 to 20 
percent. They are down now--going up 5 percent. And he said last year 
he was able to negotiate a 5 percent decrease. My friends, part of 
this, a great part of this, has to do with the large insurance pool 
that, of course, Massachusetts citizens are in now when you see these 
reductions.
  The State spending for health care reform programs last year 
represented a 1.4 percent increase in the State

[[Page H4813]]

budget. Two-thirds of their residents support the health care reform.
  It was extraordinary testimony from a businessman who had no reason 
to come forward. He's not a politician. Yes, he's in the State senate, 
but he has the credibility of being in the Senate and being a 
quintessential small businessman.
  I want to suggest to my colleagues that there's a reason why our 
colleagues do not point to the only real experience that could tell us 
something about what is going to happen with this law, and that is 
because they are not driven by data, but by some ideology that is not 
understandable. But once you get it in your head that if you're against 
the bill even when it's passed, you've got to do all you can to kill 
it--If it's health care reform, you kill health care reform. If it's 
financial reform, even after the worst recession since the Great 
Depression, then you try to kill that.
  I think that in hearing what has happened in Massachusetts that you 
would think Mitt Romney would be shouting from the hilltops about it. 
When you see what's happened in Massachusetts, what the Republicans, 
what we ourselves should be doing is studying in depth the experience 
of Massachusetts, seeing what their mistakes were, looking at their 
successes, instead of throwing horribles out there based on no data and 
based on nothing.

                              {time}  1640

  I thank you for coming forward to start a discussion that helps give 
the American people some broader sense of what this struggle is about 
and helps them to understand that when they hear the word ``repeal,'' 
it is not what it means. In order to repeal, you have to get both 
Houses and the signature of the President.
  People should be alerted that this law is here to stay. It is almost 
impossible--it will be almost impossible, unless there is a Herculean 
change in the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, to change the 
Congress in the direction of those who oppose the law. Absent that, 
every Member of this House who believes in law and order, who believes 
in the rule of law, has an obligation to sit down together to make this 
law work and not try to undermine it. To the extent that you undermine 
it, you are now undermining the health care of the citizens of the 
United States of America.
  Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative Holmes Norton.
  You know, you talk about the struggle and the move to repeal. It 
obviously didn't place consumers first and foremost in that thought 
process. It was probably listening to those deep pockets of interest 
that did not want to be pulled to the table to provide better outcomes 
for our consumers.
  Look at the benefits of the health care law for our seniors: 5.1 
million seniors receiving savings on their prescription drugs. 
Actually, I've seen this number as high as 5.3 million, and probably 
climbing in the short order of time. What an important, significant 
savings. I hear it all the time from seniors in my district who are 
always reaching into their pockets after that doughnut hole is hit, and 
they get the benefit for a while until they hit a certain threshold. As 
we all know, many, in a short order of months, are digging into their 
own pockets. These are medications that are required to stay well, and 
in many cases to stay alive.
  There are 32.5 million seniors receiving free preventative services--
health care screenings, the annual checkup, flu shots--items that are 
brought to their benefit in order to, again, underscore the value added 
of wellness. Strengthening consumer protections for seniors in the part 
D program, something I heard a lot of favorable review about, and 85 
percent of Medicare Advantage plan revenues going toward senior medical 
care rather than profits for the insurance industry.
  So these are big changes. These are changes that were welcomed by the 
senior community. I can tell you, if you close that doughnut hole by 
the year 2020, as the Affordable Care Act is to do, you're providing a 
major benefit for seniors, with the advancement of pharmaceuticals that 
speak to all sorts of illnesses. This is a wonderful opportunity for 
them to understand the attachment that is essential.
  I heard of far too many people adjusting their dosages of medications 
to balance their family's budgets. That is not the best outcome for 
health care. This advances sound decisionmaking, efficiencies, the best 
use, the wisest use of resources and, again, speaking to the dignity 
factor of our country's senior citizens.
  Representative Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, a great Representative, a 
strong voice for consumers in this House, thank you for joining 
Representative Garamendi and me. It's great to have you here. I know 
that you're hearing a lot in the State of Ohio.
  Ms. KAPTUR. I want to thank you, Congressman Tonko, for your 
leadership on so many issues that relate to the well-being of the 
American people and our economy.

  Health care is one-sixth of the leg of the stool that holds up the 
Republic. It is a major industry. When you look at all of our medical 
hospitals, all of our schools, the nursing profession, dentistry, and 
you take it all together, it is a massive employer across our country.
  Congressman Garamendi, coming from California, your experience is so 
vast in terms of your leadership at the State level there, and now here 
as a Member of Congress. So I'm very proud to stand with colleagues 
from New York and California, coastal powerhouses, from the State of 
Ohio right in the middle of the country there.
  I wanted to add to your discussions this evening some real-life 
stories that illustrate what you've been talking about tonight. Here's 
a story from Toledo, Ohio, a real story of a couple that was forced to 
drop their health coverage after the wife got sick and their health 
insurance premiums jumped from $800 a month in 2007 to $1,200 a month 
in 2008. How many families across our country, when somebody gets sick, 
the premium goes up? This bill is wonderful because it doesn't allow 
that to happen.
  For this family, the cost in 2009 would have risen to $1,600 a month, 
with a $2,500 deductible. So what did the couple do? They dropped their 
insurance. They couldn't afford the insurance, even though the wife was 
sick. But because of the law that we passed, the wife received coverage 
through a high-risk insurance pool that was set up within our State 
following the passage of the law. They're paying $400 a month--less 
than they paid before, half of what they paid before--and they have a 
$1,500 deductible. Literally, the new insurance coverage saves them 
$15,000 a year, which for them was unaffordable. That's why they 
dropped their insurance. But just that family alone tells us how 
important this act is. And think of how many cases across this country 
have similarities to theirs.
  From Marblehead, Ohio, which is very central to the district that I'm 
privileged to represent, a small business owner, a woman, was diagnosed 
with lupus. She was turned down by multiple insurance companies because 
she had a preexisting condition. But because of this act and the high-
risk insurance pool in Ohio, she was able to obtain a plan for $315 a 
month, with a $2,500 deductible--that was her choice. But she has 
obtained insurance, even though she has a preexisting condition. How 
many Americans have you said have preexisting conditions? This allows 
them to continue to pay, not be canceled. So they're contributing to 
the pool, the insurance pool; and they're able to take care of 
themselves.
  Finally, the third example I wish to place on the table is a senior 
citizen couple that faced a $3,000 to $4,000 bill, an extra 
prescription drug cost, after the husband developed a staph infection. 
How many families do we know have relatives that develop staph 
infections? That required them to spend a lot more money in 2009 and 
2010 on prescription drugs. Thankfully, the husband's health has 
improved, and they've saved money thanks to the doughnut hole 
provisions you talked about that took effect in 2010. So they didn't 
have to pay that extra money for the prescription drugs necessary that 
you have to take when you get an infection. You have to take those for 
a very long time, and they're very expensive. The wife said of their 
situation:

       For seniors like Paul and me living on limited income 
     through Social Security, these costs were not a joke. Because 
     of the Affordable Care Act, no senior will ever have to go 
     through what Paul and I spent that year doing.


[[Page H4814]]


  By the end of this decade, that doughnut hole will be completely 
closed at the rate of $500 a year; $500 a year to a senior citizen is a 
mountain of money--$50 is a lot of money because they're on limited 
incomes. Most people depend on Social Security to hold their lives 
together. So to get bills of $500 or $5,000, it's an impossibility.
  I challenge every American who's listening to my words tonight and 
every young person who has a conscience, go to the supermarket and look 
for some of the people who are staring at the vegetables, or 
raspberries, or fish, and they can't afford to buy it. Maybe you could 
slip them a couple bucks in the supermarket--nobody would even know 
about it. I've done that so many times. And they can buy something they 
want that they can't afford to buy.
  So when you're a senior citizen, limited income is a real fact of 
everyday life. So for all of the millions and millions of Americans, 
Congressman Tonko, that you talked about, this is being lived life by 
life, family by family in the State of Ohio.
  I'm very pleased to join both of you and to thank the President of 
the United States for having the guts to stick with his convictions, 
and our Speaker then, Nancy Pelosi, for fighting so hard for every vote 
in this House and really helping to lift all of America to a different 
plane for the future.
  The last thing I will say is, I come from a small business family. 
Our father was one of those people that had to sell his business 
because he got sick. He had to get health insurance for his family, so 
he went to work for an automotive company.

                              {time}  1650

  And I remember how ill he became, and what a horrible choice that was 
for him back then.
  Half the uninsured in this country are small businesses. The law says 
if you have 50 or under, you don't have to provide insurance; but if 
you're interested, those exchanges will be there for you. And there 
will also be plans that your employees can buy into if they want to.
  Wow, do I wish that had existed in the 1950s when we were growing up 
as young children and our dad could have had that plan so he wouldn't 
have had to sell his business. What a difference that would have made 
in our family.
  And that story is repeated by the tens of millions across this 
country. Half of those who could potentially benefit are small business 
owners and their workers.
  Thank you for doing this Special Order tonight as we speak on behalf 
of the American people.
  Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative Kaptur. Please feel free to 
share more information with us. The anecdotal evidence that you provide 
from your region alone speaks to the empowerment that is part of this 
transition, this progressive policy.
  And to now attempt to repeal, just as you've given people the sense 
of hope that there will be a doable outcome, that they won't have to 
cut medication in half so that they could have enough money to do all 
the other items that are required of them, to pay utility bills, or to 
afford to eat for that given month--the fact that they would cut their 
medication in half is not a sound thing. They're spending money, and 
it's probably ineffective.
  And so tethering people to a system that is sound and secure. You 
know, when people say, well, I don't want to pay for someone's 
insurance, I don't want to pay for this health care program. You're 
paying today through premiums and through taxes. You're paying for the 
worst sort of outcome by putting people into emergency rooms and having 
them visit with a different doctor each time they visit and not having 
the stability and the standardized outcome that is predictable and 
effective and efficient.
  These are the dynamics that are driven by the soundness of a policy 
like this, that, yes, will take investment, but will get far greater 
bang for the buck than what we're getting today with a haphazard sort 
of response that does not provide continuity or direction 
or standardization or predictability and certainty. We will be far 
better off and a much more compassionate response is rendered.

  From a taxpayer perspective, from a consumer perspective, it's a far 
greater, stronger, more intelligent outcome; and it speaks to, I think, 
the core fabric of this wonderful country that we do truly care. And 
this is a way to show it and still be economically sounder in our 
attempts.
  Thank you for sharing the anecdotal evidence.
  Representative Garamendi, you and I have done a number of these 
Special Orders on this House floor, and I find it fascinating to see 
what the response is out there from the public, who always call to 
engage and get more information. And so the fact that we can provide 
more information on what is included in the Affordable Care Act, I 
think, is a good opportunity here.
  And I know you always have a lot to say and a lot to share, and your 
walk in your professional life as insurance commissioner was an 
important bit of strength for all of us in the caucus.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Our colleague, Marcy Kaptur, reminded me of a personal 
story, personal things.
  My sister-in-law was a juvenile diabetic, and I think of what would 
her circumstances be if she had had this law when she was alive. The 
last 20 years of her life were a struggle. The company she worked for 
folded, and her health insurance was lost. And she spent the last 20 
years of her life struggling financially, medically, and really unable 
to get the kind of continuity of care necessary. She got a lot of help 
from her family; but even so, it was a struggle.
  Under the law today, she would have been able to get insurance. And 
in 2014, in California, or actually next year in California, there will 
be an exchange. So even though she spent those last 20 years as an 
independent contractor, selling various things over those years, she 
could enter into a large pool, that is the exchange, where she would 
have the same opportunity to buy a low-cost policy as though she were 
in Ford Motor Company with hundreds of thousands of employees.
  Our Republican colleagues would abolish the exchanges. And I just 
think about what could have been. There was no exchange, and she wasn't 
able to get that insurance; but had she lived, and had other men and 
women with diabetes or serious heart issues or other kinds of problems, 
medical problems, they could get insurance in the exchange and be part 
of a large pool.
  Simultaneously, if they didn't have the income, they would be able to 
get a subsidy. If their income was less than the poverty level, that 
insurance would be free through the Medicaid program. And if they were 
above the poverty level, it would be subsidized so that it would be 
affordable.
  I guess this is really about compassion. This is about our very moral 
sense of who we are as Americans, do we have compassion, and do we care 
for our fellow citizens.
  On today's floor I heard the most astounding arguments, arguments 
based upon falsehoods, just flat out falsehoods. I heard the Speaker 
here say that the Affordable Care Act cost employment. But since the 
Affordable Care Act has been in place for the last 2 years, private 
sector employment has grown every single month.
  Now, there may have been some company that decided not to employ 
somebody, or maybe they went out of business for any number of reasons. 
But private sector employment has grown every single month for the last 
28 months. So, taken as a whole, the Affordable Health Care Act didn't 
retard employment. It didn't cause the number of private sector 
employees to decline. In fact, they've grown.
  And I also heard the very same person, with the very same argument, 
say that it's driven up health care costs. Well, excuse me, take a look 
at the statistics, the health care statistics. We've actually seen, in 
the last 2 years, since the Affordable Health Care Act went into 
effect, a significant decline in the rate of inflation for health care. 
In fact, the rate of inflation for health care in the last 2 years, 
2010 and 2011, was the lowest rate of growth in every year except one 
in the last 50 years. It was 3.9 percent.
  Those are not my statistics. They're not pulled out of the air. Those 
are government statistics about health care inflation--3.9 percent, 
which was the lowest rate of inflation in general health care in the 
last 50 years, except only one other year.
  How about the cost of premiums?
  Before I get there, the average health care spending in 2000 to 2009 
was 6.8

[[Page H4815]]

percent per year. That's the annual growth, 6.8 percent per year. In 
2010 and 2011, as I just said, it was 3.9 percent, nearly 50 percent 
less.
  Let's get our facts right. Put aside the rhetoric and deal with the 
facts. If you're going to come down here, as Speaker or anybody else, 
use facts in your argument. Don't just throw out a number.
  Mr. Speaker, if you'd like to debate it on the floor with me, come on 
down.
  Seniors paying more? No, I don't believe so. No, they don't pay more. 
Medicare Advantage enrollees, the cost of premiums for Medicare 
Advantage was 16 percent less in 2012 than in 2010. The Affordable 
Health Care Act, was it re.."

                               speech of

                        HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Sunday, March 21, 2010

  Mrs. MALONEY. Madam Speaker, today we will cast a series of historic 
votes.
  The outcome of the votes will result in 32 million people without 
health insurance gaining coverage and 94 percent of Americans with 
guaranteed health care coverage.
  In New York State, close to 2.5 million people who are currently 
uninsured will have health care coverage once the day is over.
  To get to this point, the House had to first vote on the Senate 
passed health care bill and then vote on a bill that makes important 
changes that have been negotiated by the House to dramatically improve 
the Senate bill--this is called the reconciliation bill.
  Without a promise of these important fixes, like taking out several 
of these ``special deals'' I would not vote for the Senate bill. 
However, with the guarantee of these improvements, today I will cast my 
vote in favor of the Senate health care bill.
  I appreciate the opportunity to outline some of my concerns with the 
Senate passed health care reform bill.
  Most importantly, the Senate bill would have cost New York close to a 
billion of dollars in Medicaid funding. Unlike the House bill which 
saves New York billions, the Senate bill penalizes States like New York 
for its expanded coverage of its citizens under Medicaid. Under the 
Senate bill, States that have not significantly expanded their Medicaid 
programs would receive a large influx of Federal funding, but States 
like New York are penalized for doing the right thing. The House bill 
contained a more equitable solution to sharing the costs of Medicaid 
expansion under health care reform by providing increased Federal 
funding for Medicaid expansion regardless of existing State eligibility 
levels. FMAP provisions in the Senate bill would result in a 
significant loss to New York State as a significant number of uninsured 
New Yorkers who are eligible for Medicaid enroll, while the House bill 
fairly shares in the costs for currently enrolled and newly enrolled 
childless adults and parents. Fortunately, the reconciliation bill that 
we will be voting on, fixes this problem, and the distribution of 
Federal Medicaid funding is more equitable and saves money for New 
York.
  The Senate bill similarly penalized New York in terms of its 
treatment of payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals, DSH. 
Historically, Medicaid hospital reimbursement rates, on average, have 
been lower than the cost of providing care, and DSH payments were 
instituted to cover reimbursement shortfalls and uncompensated care 
costs. The need for DSH reimbursement will remain even after health 
care reform is passed since there will millions of newly eligible 
individuals who will receive care through Medicaid.
  The Senate bill reduced Federal funding for Medicaid DSH payments by 
$19 billion and Medicare DSH payments by $24 billion over 10 years; 
reductions to DSH payments of this magnitude will jeopardize the 
stability and the services provided by our safety net system. The 
original House bill which I supported had included more reasonable 
reductions of $10 billion each from Medicaid and Medicare DSH and 
similarly, the reconciliation bill, while not as good as the original 
House bill, reduces the cuts that the Senate bill would have imposed.
  I am also opposed to the restrictive abortion language contained in 
the Senate bill. The Senate bill is significantly onerous, stigmatizing 
abortion services and creating obstacles for those consumers who would 
like to purchase this coverage and to those insurance companies would 
like to provide this coverage. Though I am strongly opposed to these 
restrictions, I am voting for the final bill because overall, reforming 
our current health care system dramatically and positively impacts 
women. As Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I prepared a report 
that looked at the specific health care challenges facing women and how 
women would benefit from comprehensive health care reform. More than 2 
million women have lost their health insurance since the recession 
began due to their own job loss or their spouse's job loss. 1.3 million 
women lost their health coverage when their spouse lost his job and an 
additional 800,000 women lost their health care as a result of their 
own job loss. More than 2 million women have faced the brutal double-
whammy of a lost job and lost health care. While job losses

[[Page E568]]

during this recession were much greater for men than women, women have 
fared worse than men in recent months. And this has had real 
consequences for women's health care coverage: in the last 6 months, 
the number of women losing health insurance benefits due to their own 
job losses has increased by nearly 50 percent. Over one quarter, 28 
percent of women ages 19-24 have no health insurance at all. Part of 
that number is likely explained by the economic challenges facing young 
women. Young women have been hit hard in the recession, facing an 
unemployment rate of 13.1 percent, significantly higher than the 
national rate of 9.7 percent, and making it less likely that they will 
have job-based coverage. Health care reform will help us to overcome 
inequities at the center of the current system--where women pay more 
than men for the same coverage, or even, where women who are not 
smokers pay more for coverage than men who are smokers. My report and 
the reality is that the current health care system is serving women 
poorly, the recession has made the situation worse, and now more than 
ever, we need health care reform.
  I have been a strong supporter of the public option and voted for the 
House bill in large part because it contained a public option. I 
believed then and I believe now that a public insurance option will 
increase competition and reform our current system. Every day, 14,000 
Americans lose their health care coverage. A public option would have 
brought down costs and expanded access. Unfortunately, the Senate was 
unable to pass a bill with a public option, though many Senators 
supported the provision. While I am disappointed that the final bill 
that will go to the President for signature will not include it, I feel 
confident that the end product will achieve the goals of covering the 
vast majority of Americans, reduce health care costs, and reduce our 
deficit by trillions of dollars.
  Madam Speaker, it is clear that the Senate bill had flaws and as 
passed was not as good of a bill for the State of New York as it should 
have been. If I was just casting one vote today, it would be a no vote 
on this bill. However, we are being given the opportunity to fix and 
improve the Senate bill with the upcoming reconciliation bill which is 
why I am able to vote in favor of this bill. With this vote, I am 
voting in favor of helping Americans gain affordable, quality health 
care they both need and deserve, I am voting in favor of dramatically 
reducing the Federal deficit by $143 billion in the first 10 years, and 
I am voting in favor of improving coverage by removing denials of 
coverage based on preexisting conditions or gender. I am voting in 
favor of a strong and healthy future for all Americans and for our 
great country.

  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3826, ELECTRICITY SECURITY AND 
   AFFORDABILITY ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4118, 
   SUSPENDING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY LAW EQUALS FAIRNESS ACT

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 497 and ask for its immediate consideration.
  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:

                              H. Res. 497

       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this 
     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule 
     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the 
     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of 
     the bill (H.R. 3826) to provide direction to the 
     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
     regarding the establishment of standards for emissions of any 
     greenhouse gas from fossil fuel-fired electric utility 
     generating units, and for other purposes. The first reading 
     of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order 
     against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate 
     shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour

                              {time}  1230

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentleman from Texas 
is recognized for 1 hour.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), 
pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only.


                             General Leave

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
on H. Res. 497.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 497 provides for consideration of 
two bills, one of which addresses the country's worsening health 
insurance situation due to the Affordable Care Act; the other addresses 
the Environmental Protection Agency's attempts to cripple our economy 
with costly regulations which have dubious health benefits.
  The rule before us today provides for 1 hour of debate for each bill, 
controlled by the primary committee of jurisdiction. The committee made 
in order every amendment submitted for consideration to H.R. 3826, the 
Electricity Security and Affordability Act, including three amendments 
offered by Democrats and five amendments offered by Republicans. 
Finally, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit on 
each bill, allowing for yet another opportunity to amend the 
legislation. This is a straightforward rule for consideration of two 
very important bills.
  H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security and Affordability Act is a 
bipartisan response to the Environmental Protection Agency's 
wrongheaded approach to our energy future. It was carefully crafted by 
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia and the Republican 
chairman of the Energy and Power Subcommittee, Ed Whitfield from 
Kentucky. The bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to 
acknowledge within its greenhouse gas regulations that different 
sources of fuel--such as natural gas, such as

[[Page H2161]]

coal--require different approaches to the regulatory sphere. Further, 
it prevents the Environmental Protection Agency from unilaterally 
imposing new regulations on existing power plants--those power plants 
that are already up and running, providing heat to our Nation, which is 
currently under the throes of a significant cold snap. This limitation 
exists until Congress has weighed in and passed a law specifying an 
effective date for the regulations to begin.
  Finally, as is just good government, the bill requires strengthened 
reporting requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency.
  One of the most frustrating parts of the EPA's new venture in 
regulating our existing energy infrastructure is that the EPA has 
actively blocked proper congressional oversight from receiving the 
science and calculations used in crafting these new costly regulations. 
That simply must end. If the Environmental Protection Agency is 
proposing new regulations because they believe they will truly make 
Americans healthier, let them share the data. Let them share the data 
with the United States Congress so it can be peer reviewed. Both the 
Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science Committee have 
continually been ignored when requesting such data. That is 
unacceptable. That must end. This legislation is a step toward bringing 
accountability to an agency that for too long has run roughshod over 
our economy.
  The second bill contained in this rule, H.R. 4118, Suspending the 
Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act, addresses the 
disparity that President Obama and Secretary Sebelius have created 
between big businesses, which have been given a reprieve from having to 
comply with the mandates in the Affordable Care Act, and individual 
Americans, who have been given no such help by this President. Just 
this week, the press reported that the administration will delay yet 
another provision of the Affordable Care Act by allowing insurers to 
continue offering health plans that do not meet the Affordable Care 
Act's minimum coverage requirements. It is becoming so commonplace for 
this administration to waive or ignore provisions--by their own 
admission, this is their signature law, and they continue to waive 
provisions. The American people cannot seem to get an even break, and 
no one even seems to notice anymore. There is little doubt that this is 
exactly what the President is hoping for.
  In the last 8 months, the President has delayed or modified overly 22 
provisions in his signature health care law. We are all familiar--we 
have all seen the headlines: delays in the preexisting program; delays 
in the employer mandate; delays in the reporting requirement; changing 
the rules under which Congress has to buy insurance; delay, delay, 
delay, in his own law. The President has been quick to fix parts of the 
law that have political consequences for his allies and to protect his 
own talking points.
  Yet, where is the President's protection for the American people?
  Under the health care law, Americans who don't have health insurance 
and refuse to purchase a government-approved insurance policy will face 
an annual fine--an annual fine--that increases every year.
  However, purchasing a government-approved plan also means you have to 
pay big premiums. You are forced to navigate a dysfunctional Web site. 
You may lose the doctor you like and place your personal information in 
jeopardy on an unsecure Web site.
  Today, Republicans are offering a legislative solution to help 
Americans get out from under the crushing weight of the so-called 
Affordable Care Act. H.R. 4118, also known as the Simple Fairness Act, 
will give hardworking Americans the same relief that the President has 
already given to big businesses across the country.
  The administration has no problem delaying the employer mandate, not 
just once for 2014, but a second time for another full year for 
employers with 51-100 employees. Shouldn't that same relief be provided 
to rank-and-file Americans?
  The President has refused to work with Congress to change the law so 
today, we are moving ahead and doing what is right for the American 
people. The Simple Fairness Act will eliminate the penalty for 2014 for 
those individuals who chose not to purchase a government-approved 
health care plan.
  It is clear that H.R. 4118 offers the only feasible lifeline to 
millions of Americans who are faced with purchasing an expensive health 
care plan that does not meet their needs. It is Congress' job to 
protect the American people. I urge my colleagues to pass this rule so 
Washington can stop making decisions about American's health care and 
instead individuals can be free to decide for themselves. I encourage 
my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and ``yes'' on the underlying 
bills.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, this is just not an ordinary day, this is a very 
important thing that is happening here, particularly for those of you 
who watch Congress a lot and want to know what it is we are about. This 
is a very special occasion here. As you can see by this poster on my 
right, we are celebrating a double golden anniversary. Today, the 
majority is holding the 50th vote to repeal or to otherwise undermine 
the Affordable Care Act under the 50th closed rule.

  Now, to people who don't understand what a closed rule is, that means 
this rule is coming to the floor to debate these bills, and it will not 
allow them to be amended. That is not exactly an open Congress in a 
great democracy.
  The majority has defied all expectations in reaching those milestones 
today, and as one often does when celebrating a colleague's 50th 
birthday or acknowledging a friend's 50th wedding anniversary, I want 
to take a moment to reflect on all that the majority has done to 
achieve this great honor.
  Indeed, many Americans, including myself, were doubtful we would ever 
see the majority hold their 50th vote to repeal a good health care law 
that is already benefiting more than 9 million Americans because, why 
would Congress want to take health care away from people?
  I remember back in 2012, when CBS News reported that the majority had 
spent 80 legislative hours--costing approximately $48 million--to hold 
33 votes to repeal the ACA. That is just the amount of money spent on 
floor time and committee time. They had held 33 votes at that time to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act. Given the incredible waste of time and 
taxpayer money, I was hopeful that the 33rd vote might be the last. But 
the majority has persevered, and continued to ignore the Nation's 
pressing priorities to make it to today's 50th vote.
  Of course, getting this far wouldn't have been possible without the 
help of a closed legislative process--a process that has allowed the 
majority to pursue a 50th vote without pause.
  Last year, the majority presided over the most closed session in 
history, and repeatedly passed closed rules that shut out the voices of 
the nearly 200 duly elected Members of Congress who sit on my side of 
the aisle. Now today, the majority is presenting their 50th closed rule 
in order to hold a 50th go-nowhere vote to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act.
  It is truly amazing that the majority has managed to hold the same 
vote 50 times while so many Americans and so much of the world cries 
out for help. As we know, there are global crises from Ukraine to 
Afghanistan. At home, there are millions still looking for work; 
millions more are working for a minimum wage upon which they cannot 
survive.
  In fact, just this week the number of Americans whose emergency 
unemployment insurance has expired will surpass 2 million individuals, 
including almost 200,000 veterans. We could have averted the crisis 
weeks ago, and we have tried numerous times to do that, but the 
majority has repeatedly said ``no.'' Indeed, some of our colleagues 
have said it would be immoral to help out those who have no money 
coming into their home.
  Meanwhile, the Center for American Progress released a report today 
that found that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would reduce 
Federal spending on food stamps by $4.6 billion a year. Despite a 
similar estimate from the Congressional Budget Office declaring that 
raising the minimum wage

[[Page H2162]]

would lift 900,000 people out of poverty, the majority refuses to join 
my Democratic colleagues and me to give America a raise.
  Mr. Speaker, there are dozens, if not hundreds of bills that deserve 
our consideration, but today's attempt to repeal a good health care law 
is not one of them. In fact, I have a list of 50 votes that we could be 
taking today instead of another vote to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act--everything from rebuilding our crumbling bridges and roads to 
creating American manufacturing jobs.
  Of particular importance is a bill that I authored called the 
Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act that will address 
the immediate crisis of antibiotic-resistant diseases and help to save 
lives. Despite the urgent need to protect public health, we have been 
unable to even get a hearing on this important legislation.
  The majority's refusal to take action on any of these pressing issues 
is truly an achievement, not one to be proud of. I hope I have made it 
clear that we cannot celebrate that achievement.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my sincere hope that the milestone the majority is 
reaching today will be the end of the line for their tired political 
game. We have far too many issues that need our attention, and it is 
well past time that we got to work. I strongly urge my colleagues to 
vote ``no'' on today's rule and the underlying legislation.
  I reserve the balance of my time.

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes for a response.
  Mr. Speaker, there have been 36 changes to the Affordable Care Act 
since it was signed into law. It has been a little over 3 years since 
the bill was signed into law. Thirty-six changes means one a month.
  How does the breakdown of those 36 changes occur? According to the 
Galen Institute published this morning, 15 times, Congress has passed 
and the President signed legislation changing the Affordable Care Act. 
Twice, the Supreme Court modified the Affordable Care Act, but 19 
times, President Obama made a change unilaterally.
  We are here today debating a delay on the penalties under the 
individual mandate, but it might interest the Congress to know that the 
President himself delayed the individual mandate. The administration 
changed the deadline for the individual mandate by declaring that 
customers who had purchased insurance by March 31 will avoid the tax 
penalty.
  Previously and by law, they were required to purchase that insurance 
by Valentine's Day, February 14, so there has already been a 6-week 
delay. We are simply trying to place in code what the President is 
doing unilaterally.
  You want to talk about a closed process where people don't have an 
opportunity to participate? That is governing by executive fiat. That 
is what we are trying to stop today.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Polis) will control the time for the minority.
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Well, I want to come to the floor to wish the Republicans a happy 
anniversary. I brought a gold ring. This is the 50th repeal of 
ObamaCare. I want to wish my colleagues a happy 50th anniversary for 
the appeal of ObamaCare.
  Like any marriage that lasts 50 years, it takes a lot of work. The 
American people have shown that they want this marriage to last. They 
have shown that by reelecting Barack Obama as President. They have 
shown that by electing a Senate that won't even consider a repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act; but also like any marriage, it takes work 
along the way to improve it, to work at it, to make changes to it.
  Democrats stand ready to work with President Obama, to fine-tune this 
wonderful marriage celebrating the 50th anniversary of its repeal here 
today, to make sure it endures for another 50 repeal votes by the House 
Republicans here in the coming months. We are ready to make the changes 
that we need to, to ensure that the Affordable Care Act works for every 
American.
  There are issues in the implementation in my district. Two of my 
counties, Summit and Eagle County, have among the highest insurance 
rates in the exchange in the entire country, these two counties. That 
is due to a problem that the State had in implementing it, but we would 
love to work with Republicans on a Federal fix for Eagle and Summit 
County, and the other Colorado counties that are affected by it.
  I would be proud to work with my colleagues to replace the revenue 
and the medical and device tax with other sources of revenue to ensure 
that the Affordable Care Act works.
  There are a lot of great ideas, and perhaps it is time that, rather 
than continue to celebrate anniversaries of repeal, that we enter 
couples counseling sessions today, and we work together in trying to 
find common ground.

[[Page H2163]]

  Rather than talking about repealing ObamaCare and going back to a 
system we know wasn't working, in which 40 million Americans didn't 
have health care insurance, in which Americans and my constituents and 
yours were frustrated that, year after year, rates were going up 10, 
15, 20 percent--rather than going back to a formula we know didn't 
work, let's enter couples counseling and work together to make health 
care work in our country, to talk about a path forward, with the 
President, with Democrats, with Republicans, with Independents, to 
ensure that these cost increases that have been epidemic the last 
couple of decades come to an end, that we can extend coverage to more 
American families, that we can ensure that the quality of health care 
that is our Nation's pride can continue to be available to Americans, 
regardless of their economic background.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would just emphasize there have 
been changes by administrative action, some 19 that President Obama has 
done all on his own, without any influence from Congress.
  Now, if the gentleman were truly interested about an offset for 
repealing the medical device tax, perhaps he might look more favorably 
on the bill before us today, H.R. 4118. The Congressional Budget Office 
scores a significant savings by passing H.R. 4118.
  Perhaps there are some other things that could be done with that 
money as well; but nevertheless, the President has, on his own, delayed 
employee reporting, delayed subsidies through the Federal exchange. He 
closed the high-risk pool.
  He has doubled the allowable deductibles. He has required self-
attestation and eliminated the reporting requirements under the law 
that he signed in March of 2010.
  He last fall said: Okay. I give up. Insurance can offer plans that we 
just told you were illegal, that they were crummy insurance, and now, 
we are going to allow them to be offered again.
  All of these were actions taken by the executive under a closed 
process. With no input or oversight by the people's House--by the 
United States House of Representatives.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Isn't that wonderful? Isn't this great that the President has made 19 
changes to improve the Affordable Care Act to make it work?
  You know what? That is what a marriage takes. That is what has helped 
the Affordable Care Act withstand the 50th vote to repeal it here in 
the House. Had the President been inflexible--just like in a marriage, 
if one partner is inflexible, it would have been a lot harder to 
survive 50 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Here, we are 
celebrating the golden anniversary of repeal votes, 50 votes.
  But thanks to the President's flexibility with 19 changes, hopefully, 
there are more along the way to ensure that all Americans have access 
to affordable health care:
  That no American faces pricing discrimination or is kept out of a 
plan because of a preexisting condition;
  That people can move between employers;
  That somebody can leave a large company to be an entrepreneur and 
have a startup without worrying about losing their health care if they 
have a preexisting condition;
  Making sure that young Americans, as they are trying to find a job or 
working part time, can stay on their parents' plan;
  Making sure that Americans have a real choice in the exchanges that 
choose between multiple providers.
  These were some of the elements that I think the American people want 
to keep and one of the reasons that this health care act has not only 
withstood 50 votes to repeal and is celebrating its golden anniversary, 
but will survive the next 50 votes if the House Republicans choose to 
have them to try to appeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The American people want to see changes to make it work. We applaud 
the President for the 19 changes he made. We encourage him to use the 
discretion that we rightly give him under the Affordable Care Act to 
help make it work.
  We encourage the discretion at the State level that many Governors, 
like the Governor of Kentucky and others, have shown to make the 
Affordable Care Act work in their State.
  We applaud the fact that there are over $200 billion of deficit 
reduction in the Affordable Care Act. If we can find additional savings 
and replace lost revenue, we are certainly open to that discussion. So 
I rise in celebration of having withstood 50 repeal votes. We are ready 
for the next 50.

  We use these opportunities to highlight the American people on the 
benefits of the Affordable Care Act and to say that we are ready to 
have a real discussion with Republicans, to exert our legislative 
privilege, to make changes, and in the absence of that, we applaud the 
President in using the abilities that we give him under the act to help 
make sure the Affordable Care Act truly makes health care more 
affordable for American families.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, here is the Affordable Care Act. The 
President says it is the law of the land. How does it describe the 
effective date for the individual mandate? Under section 1501, 
subparagraph D, effective date:

       The amendments made by this section shall apply to the 
     taxable years ending after December 31, 2013.

  Pretty unambiguous, pretty easy to understand. It doesn't seem to 
have a lot of flexibility or wiggle room written into it.
  How does the language read that describes the effective date for the 
employer mandate? Well, that reads under section 1513, subparagraph D, 
effective date:

       The amendments made by this section shall apply to the 
     months beginning after December 31, 2013.

  It doesn't sound as if there is a lot of flexibility; yet the 
President, on his own, found the flexibility only within the executive 
branch to say that effective date is no longer valid.
  We are simply saying for Mr. and Mrs. American--for the average 
American, we should be able to delay the effective date of the penalty 
because this law has been a disaster from start to finish. Stories 
about the Web site are now legion.
  We should give the same relief to the average American that the 
President gave to his friends in Big Business.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This bill--this 50th anniversary--golden anniversary of ObamaCare 
repeals here in the House--50th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, 
gutting mental parity, health parity, gutting protection for Americans 
with preexisting conditions, went through no hearings, no markups, no 
amendments that we are allowed to discuss or debate or vote on here on 
the floor of the House. This is not the process for improving the 
quality of health care for American families.
  The American people have made it clear they want this marriage to 
last. They want to make it work. They know it requires hard work. The 
President has made 19 wonderful changes to the law.
  I am not a constitutional lawyer. If there are folks on the other 
side who want to sue the President, who think that he did something 
contrary to the law we passed, they are certainly welcome to sue. I 
believe that the President was given broad discretion under the law to 
make it work.
  I hope that this legislative body takes up the gauntlet and makes the 
changes we need to make the Affordable Care Act work. Any marriage 
takes effort. Here, we have a marriage between the Affordable Care Act 
and the American people, and 50 votes to repeal it are not going to 
break up that marriage.
  It is a stronger marriage than that because the American people have 
voted on it. They didn't elect a Presidential candidate who wanted to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act. They didn't elect a Senate that wanted 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  So here we are, and we are welcome to have another 50, 100, 200 votes 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act; or we can get to work on an open 
process, letting Members of both parties offer floor amendments. This 
rule allows no floor amendments.
  Having a markup in committee, having hearings in committee about how 
we can deliver better health care value to the American people will 
make sure

            THE GOP DOCTORS CAUCUS: THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, here we are now in February 
2014, and the second session of the 113th Congress has begun. The 
administration still has to deal with daily headlines speaking of the 
disaster of--you guessed it--the Affordable Care Act. I have to 
sometimes refer to that as the ``Unaffordable Care Act.''
  Today, the news came from the nonpartisan CBO, the Congressional 
Budget Office. My colleagues are all familiar with that. Their report 
states that the administration's rosy projections are a mere fairy 
tale. If you take a dive into these numbers from the CBO, Mr. Speaker, 
you will see last year's goals amended lower as the low participation 
and atrocious rollout of the exchanges have finally caught up with 
those estimates.
  Let me just give you, colleagues, a few highlights:
  The CBO lowered the estimate of exchange enrollees to 6 million. That 
is 1 million less than they estimated at this time last year. Now, this 
isn't all that surprising given the problems with the Web site--
healthcare.gov--and the rest of the implementation of ObamaCare, but it 
definitely reinforces the notion that this plan is not working.
  The CBO estimates that 31 million Americans will still be uninsured 
in 2024. Colleagues, when this bill was being discussed in Energy and 
Commerce way back in 2009--in 2008 even--the Democratic majority at the 
time said there were 45 million people who were uninsured. That number 
really shrunk down considerably when you realized that there were a 
number of people who were eligible for Medicaid who just didn't know 
it. It could have been as many as 10 or 11 or 12 million. Obviously, 
there are a lot of people in this country illegally uninsured but who 
are not eligible. Then there were the people making $75,000 a year in 
their households who could afford health insurance but who just chose, 
because of the Constitution--their personal liberty--to pay as they 
went. It is not something I recommend. The CBO estimates now that in 
2024--10 years later--after its passage and full implementation on 
October 1 of this year, 2014, that there will still be 31 million 
Americans uninsured. What have we really solved here? It doesn't sound 
like we have really helped very much.
  Now, this bill was sold to the American people as the solution to 
eliminating the uninsured. Instead, the bill only, really, adds cost in 
the form of very expensive mandates to everyone who already had 
insurance. A lot of them now are just saying, Heck, I will be one of 
these who will go bare. I will, maybe, set up my own savings account 
for health care, and will put $100 a month--or whatever--in a checking 
account and get a physical when I need it annually or biannually, and I 
will pay my own way--that has happened--and pay the little fine of $95.
  So that is what is happening, and it is quite a legacy for the 
President's signature piece of legislation. I don't think it is the 
legacy that he anticipated, and it is certainly not the one that he 
wants today.
  Finally, there is the headline from the newspaper, The Hill. Most of 
us read that, don't we, colleagues? We read all of these newspapers if 
we don't run out of time. In The Hill today, here is its headline: 
``CBO: O-Care Slowing

[[Page H1585]]

Growth, Contributing to Job Losses''--with ``O'' standing for 
``ObamaCare.''
  The CBO projects that the law will reduce labor force compensation by 
1 percent from 2017 to 2024, twice the reduction it previously had 
projected. This will decrease the number of full-time equivalent jobs 
by 2.3 million in 2021, and this is up from the previous estimate of 
800,000. There is a big difference, my colleagues, between 2.3 million 
and 800,000. This is remarkable. Through a combination of higher health 
care costs, resulting in lower compensation and perverse incentives for 
folks to not work as much in order to preserve their subsidies, it is 
truly not the American Dream.
  The administration, Mr. Speaker, continues to push for more money for 
jobs programs, yet, at the same time, it continues to fight for a bill 
that has yet to work and will lead to rewarding people for working 
less. What were these jobs programs? Just get rid of--what can I call 
it?--the worst bill, maybe, that has ever been passed in the history of 
this body, of this Congress. The Affordable Care Act has given us 
higher costs, not lower. It has performed much worse than was promised, 
and it will incent our citizens to work less. That is not what we want. 
That is really not what they want.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the administration to give in to reality 
and to let us repeal this bill. I don't think it is the first choice to 
just sit back and see it collapse under its own weight. You hear that 
expression a lot. I think that very well could happen, but let's take, 
maybe, a more responsible approach.

  Mr. Speaker, I would say this to the President:
  Mr. President, let's take a more responsible approach, and you work 
with the Congress--with Republicans and Democrats, with the House and 
the Senate. You get more engaged than you have ever been before, and 
work with us. Let's repeal it, and let's start over with something that 
truly does work, because we all agree that we have the greatest health 
care on the face of this Earth. Why is it that people pay thousands of 
dollars to get on a jet plane to fly from other countries to go to the 
Mayo Clinic or to Sloan-Kettering or to the WellStar Health System in 
my district, the 11th of Georgia, to get their health care, to get 
their surgery, to get their treatment for cancer? You don't see people 
from this country going in the opposite direction, because they get 
that good care here. So, Mr. President, we can work together. We can. 
The American people want us to. They don't want one side jamming the 
other. They do want us to work together.
  I want to take some time during this Special Order hour that our 
Republican leadership has afforded us. I hope some of my colleagues 
from the House GOP Doctors Caucus will be joining me momentarily, and I 
will yield to them as this is the opportunity for us to explain to our 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle what needs to be done and how we 
can work together and clearly get this done and get it done in a timely 
fashion, if not this year, certainly in the 114th Congress.
  This Doctors Caucus that I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, is something that 
I put together a number of years ago, and we are now up to about 22 
members. I say ``doctors.'' There are a lot of categories of doctors, 
but I am talking about doctors who work specifically in the health care 
space, which is one-sixth of the economy of this country. These doctors 
can be medical doctors. They can be dentists. They can be 
psychologists. They can be advanced practice nurses. Indeed, even 
hospital administrators are part of this group because they know. They 
understand that in our caucus we have, probably, 600 years of 
accumulated clinical experience. That means there is a little gray 
around the sideburns on a few of us.
  This knowledge--this expertise--our leadership on the Republican side 
recognizes that. Our committee chairs on Energy and Commerce and on 
Ways and Means and Education and the Workforce--every one of those 
committees that has any jurisdiction over health care--understand that, 
and they look to us. They look to us for expertise and guidance and 
explanations just as we who have worked in the health care sector 
before we got elected to the Congress look to educators, look to 
accountants, look to attorneys in their previous lives to help us on 
issues that we are not so up to date on or on which we don't have that 
level of expertise. That is the way it should be, and that is the way 
it should be, in my opinion, on both sides of the aisle.

                              {time}  1630

  So we Doctors Caucus meet, if not weekly, at least every 2 weeks. We 
talk about issues. We have been talking about this Affordable Care Act 
for the last 3 years and going through it section by section and trying 
to have a thorough understanding. We bring understanding to the table, 
but everybody can learn something that they didn't know in a 2,700-page 
bill. That is the due diligence that we have done over these last 
several years.
  When we read in the media or we hear from the Democratic side of the 
aisle, or either in the House of Representatives or from the Majority 
Leader Harry Reid and the Democratic majority in the Senate, saying, 
well--or even, Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States. How 
many times have we heard him say: If you have an idea, if you have a 
better plan, bring it to me, bring it to me; I am all ears; I want to 
listen? And we have done that.
  I value the opportunity to be here today to explain some of the 
things that have been done and that they have really come through the 
House GOP Doctors Caucus. One of our members is my colleague from 
Georgia, an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Tom Price. Dr. Tom Price and I 
served in the Georgia Senate. We are medical colleagues: he, an 
orthopaedic surgeon; I, an obstetrician. Now we have been in the 
Congress together for 10 years. And so he is a very active member of 
this House GOP Doctors Caucus, and he has a bill.
  To just set the record straight, colleagues, let me tell you about 
Dr. Tom Price's bill, H.R. 2300, Empowering Patients First Act. Well, 
that bill is not 2,700 pages, but it is a comprehensive bill. A lot of 
the sections in that bill are individual ideas that have come from the 
Doctors Caucus. I am proud that he has included a number of my 
suggestions in regard to medical liability reform and other things. And 
so, it is a compendium of ideas.
  It is a very good bill, a very good alternative. It is market driven. 
It does not interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, that 
sanctity, and it is a sanctity. Dr. Price understands that, and every 
member of the House GOP Doctors Caucus understands that. This bill, 
believe me, has the opportunity to get traction and, when it is brought 
to this House floor, to pass this Chamber.
  Now, at the same time, we just heard, Mr. Speaker, in recent days 
that the Senate has drafted a bill. It doesn't have a number yet, but 
Dr. Tom Coburn, the OB/GYN family practitioner from Muskogee, Oklahoma, 
whom I have worked very closely with, the Doctors Caucus has worked 
very closely with, and Dr. Barrasso and Dr. John Boozman. So, the 
Senate Republican doctors and the House Republican Doctors Caucus have 
worked together.
  Dr. Coburn, along with Senator Burr from North Carolina and Senator 
Orrin Hatch, one of the most senior and thoughtful and brilliant 
Members of the Senate from the State of Utah, they have this bill. They 
call it the Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and 
Empowerment Act, the acronym, Patient CARE Act from the Senate.
  So, we are right there, Mr. President. With all due respect, we have 
ideas. We have Dr. Price's bill. We have Dr. Coburn's bill. We have 
other members of the Doctors Caucus. And the Doctors Caucus in the 
Senate is smaller, but we are here to help. We want to help. We truly 
want to bring down the cost of health care and maintain that quality 
that we are so proud of. It can be done. It can, indeed, be done.
  Let me talk a little bit about the economy in regard to current law, 
PPACA, ObamaCare, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ObamaCare 
has forced employers to cut hours, and as a result, part-time 
employment has gone through the roof. It has already forced many 
businesses to choose between, on the one hand, hiring new workers or 
providing health coverage. Mr. Speaker, they just can't do both.
  President Obama always says health costs are rising at the lowest 
rates ever. Well, that is not because of his bill. That is because the 
economy is

[[Page H1586]]

dragging. His bill has not helped the health care industry. The costs 
are lower because people are not seeking care; they don't have the 
money. And so, yeah, sure, the overall costs of health care are going 
down, but that is not a good thing. That is a bad thing.
  The Obama administration delayed the job-killing employer mandate for 
a full year so that doesn't go into effect, colleagues, until January 1 
of 2015, 11 months from now. It has left the rest of Americans on the 
hook for this massive tax hike. The bill adds costs to running a 
business, massive tax increases, and of course, as I said at the 
outset, higher monthly premiums.
  You know, one of the promises the President made, among many that he 
failed to keep, was that the average cost, of a health insurance 
premiums would be $2,500 a year lower than pre-ObamaCare.
  Just the opposite has happened. And I don't think he ever said 
anything about what the deductible would be, Mr. Speaker. But in some 
of these policies, an individual deductible might go from $1,000 a year 
to $3,000 a year, and a family deductible from $3,000 a year to $8,000 
a year. That is a 200 percent increase, a doubling of the monthly 
premiums. It creates just enormous uncertainty across large 
corporations, small businesses, and, of course, particularly the one-
sixth of our economy that is the health care industry.
  Think about the medical device tax and what it is doing to jobs in 
that industry. The medical device tax has already forced companies like 
Michigan-based Stryker Corporation to cut a thousand jobs. Boston 
Scientific canceled plans to build new facilities in the United States, 
instead moving these high-paying, highly technical, and innovative 
research jobs across the pond, overseas.
  Let's look for a moment at the effect on small businesses. I speak 
often, and I know all of you do, too, on both sides of the aisle, 
because we go back home and we face our constituents; we have to, and 
we should. But I speak with these small business owners in the 11th 
District of Georgia, northwest Georgia, and my four counties. I want to 
know how President Obama's health care law has affected the day-to-day 
operations of their companies.

  Well, ObamaCare has not even been fully implemented because of all 
these executive orders and the fiats that come down and the waivers 
that are granted to certain ones but not others. So ObamaCare really 
has not been fully implemented, even though the date is passed, but job 
creators and employees in Georgia and nationwide are already feeling 
the pain. Across the board, they have expressed frustration with its 
new rules and the ``moving target'' regulations, the increase in health 
care costs, and, of course, the uncertainty that they hate. This law 
has certainly created a heck of a lot of that, hasn't it, colleagues?
  ObamaCare has forced employers to cut hours; and as a result of that, 
part-time employment has gone up, as I said a few minutes ago. It has 
already forced many businesses to choose, again, do I hire that 50th 
worker or do I just say no, I am going to take two part-time workers 
instead of one full-time? Or, even worse, I am going to hire that 50th 
worker, but I am going to drop health care coverage, Mr. Speaker, for 
all of my employees. And while I get a waiver for the first 30, for the 
next 20, I am going to pay $2,000 a year per employee that will go into 
the exchange.
  One Georgia businessman who employs 47 people told me that ObamaCare 
has forced him to hire subcontractors instead of hiring new full-time 
employees. Another owner who has 49 workers recently purchased a robot 
instead of hiring new welders. That robot doesn't have to feed a family 
of four. It may be very efficient, but the robot doesn't have a heart 
and doesn't have anxiety.
  On Main Street, uncertainty and higher costs get even worse when a 
company needs to create more than 50 jobs, as I just mentioned, 
creating a barrier to job creation and the expansion of their business.
  ObamaCare forces employees to work fewer hours to stay on as part-
time workers. It is estimated that ObamaCare will require American job 
creators, families, and health care providers to spend--get this, 
colleagues--more than 127 million hours a year on compliance. The EPA 
couldn't have been more onerous than this bill, and they are pretty 
darned onerous.
  One Georgia businesswoman has been forced to hold numerous meetings 
on company time for her employees to help them understand the paperwork 
involved in trying to get health care. Besides a loss in productivity, 
these new rules are costing her. She recently hired an outside health 
care expert just to ensure she is running her company ``by the books.''
  Mitzi Smith's small plumbing company in Marietta, Georgia, is known 
for its quality and its compassion and the excellence of its workers; 
and yet they are struggling to hold on, even with a wonderful 
reputation, because of this law.
  Providing relief for taxpayers by delaying these costly mandates for 
1 year is not enough, and I will continue fighting to dismantle every 
single piece of this train wreck law. I pledge to the people of Georgia 
that that is what I am going to do. It is an accountability pledge. It 
is not a term limit pledge. It is just to say, Look, I am not up here 
to be a potted plant. You have hired me to be your voice to speak for 
you on issues like this one. There are others. But I think now, as we 
approach the elections of 2014, what is more important than putting 
people back to work and providing them assurance that they can keep 
their doctor, they can keep their hospital, they can keep the health 
care that they want, not larded up with a bunch of funded mandates, 
really, that are causing those premiums to go up that they don't need 
and they don't want?

                              {time}  1645

  It is a one-size-fits-all. And in health care, one size, colleagues, 
and you know this, one size doesn't fit all.
  I mentioned a few minutes ago about the excise tax, the 2.3 percent 
on medical devices. Let me mention a couple of companies that have been 
in touch with my office concerning this issue.
  Smith & Nephew medical company announced in February that it will lay 
off almost 100 workers in their Tennessee and Massachusetts plants.
  Cook Medical, a very familiar name, has canceled plans to open five, 
count them, five United States factories because the tax, this medical 
device tax, would cost them $20 million a year in the coming years. And 
remember, colleagues, this medical device tax is not on their profits. 
This is a tax on their revenue, so it is much more onerous than if it 
were just a tax on their profit.
  Boston Scientific, planning for a more than $100 million charge 
against earnings in 2013, has now built, get this, a $35 million 
research facility in not Boston, but in Ireland, and is building a $150 
million factory in China.
  Stryker Corporation, based in Michigan, blames the tax for 1,000 
layoffs.
  Zimmer, based in Indiana, is laying off 450 people and taking a $50 
million charge against earnings.
  Medtronic, one of my classmates from Georgia Tech was the CEO of 
Medtronic, brilliant man, retired now, but I will never forget him. He 
was brilliant at Georgia Tech and throughout his entire career, and he 
was the CEO at a time for Medtronic. They make heart valves and many 
lifesaving medical devices. They expect an annual charge against 
earnings of $175 million.
  Covidien has cited the tax in explaining 200 layoffs and a decision 
to move some production to Costa Rica and Mexico. I have nothing 
against Costa Rica or Mexico, great countries, great people, but, you 
know, when we are looking at an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent--if 
you believe that, it is probably closer to 15 percent when you count 
all the people that have just given up. They have been unemployed for 
over a year and they are just out of it, they are not even counted 
anymore.
  So, I could go on and on and on and give you examples. I will give 
you one more.
  A Guthrie, Oklahoma, Taco Bell has cut its full-time employees' hours 
to 28 per week or less. If you had a job and you got to work 28 hours a 
week, colleagues, I don't know about y'all, but I would need three of 
those jobs to support my family and my children and help support my 
grandchildren.
  Former employee Johnna Davis said, and I quote Johnna, ``They 
informed everybody,'' the company, ``that nobody was considered full-
time any longer . . . that everybody was now

[[Page H1587]]

considered part-time, and they would be cutting hours back to 28 or 
less due to ObamaCare.''
  Spiritwear, an Idaho-based clothes company that specializes in 
licensed college and football team colors and logo apparel is poised to 
more than double their business this year.
  Mr. Speaker, that is great news, isn't it?
  However, the company is on the cusp of having 50 full-time employees. 
She is upset that what seems to be her best solution, hiring 
independent contractors, would give her less control--and it would--
over worker hours and how much involvement they can have in other parts 
of the company.
  Darden Restaurants, parent company of such well-known and very good 
restaurants as Olive Garden and Red Lobster and Longhorn Steakhouse, 
they tested making some workers part-time last year. The chain has 
decided not to make all full-time workers part-time, but it has not 
ruled out a broader shift toward that very thing, part-time work.
  Then in January 2014, Target announced that they would no longer 
provide health care coverage for their part-time employees.
  Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have left?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 29 minutes remaining.
  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we have some time left, but I 
think, colleagues, that you get the picture here. We have a real 
problem right here in River City--and by that, I mean the Nation's 
Capitol, but I also mean the entire country--and we have to do 
something about it.
  We can't just keep kicking the can down the road, as we have done 
with Medicare and Social Security, needed reforms, protections, 
strengthening to make sure that these programs are there for our 
children and our grandchildren.
  But here we have created a whole new entitlement program that really, 
when you look at it, it is punishing both our seniors and our young 
because it is forcing the young people who finally reach that 27th 
birthday, and they can no longer, now, be on their parents' health 
insurance plan. Maybe they have been living at home, post-college, and 
the parents have finally just said, Honey, you are just going to have 
to move out. We need our space. We need a little privacy.
  These young people have a job, and they want to move out with a 
friend or someone that they went to school with. They want to move on 
with their lives. They are adults now, and they have got a job, and 
they find that, to get health insurance, it is astronomical. Yet the 
salary that they make, their entry-level salary, is too much to make 
them eligible for a subsidy.
  So what are they going to do? They are going to pay that fine, that 
$95 fine, and maybe even when it gets to $600, they are going to pay 
that, and they are going to go bare. I use that as an expression of 
being not having health insurance coverage. They may be 10-foot tall 
and bulletproof. They may take care of themselves. They may not do 
skydiving and some risky sort of behavior. But you never know when that 
Mack truck is going to run you down and you are going to end up in the 
emergency room.
  So we want to make sure we get this right. So far we have gotten it 
totally wrong. But we can do better. We will do better. We need to do 
it in a bicameral, bipartisan way.

  I mentioned my colleague, Dr. Price, and his bill. I mentioned my 
other colleagues on the House GOP Doctors Caucus as we continue to work 
on things, my cochair, Dr. Phil Roe, a fellow OB/GYN from Tri-Cities, 
Tennessee, former mayor of Kingsport or Johnson City. We can do it and 
we will do it.
  But, Mr. President, you said, if you like what you have, you can keep 
it. You also said, if anybody, Member of Congress, has a better idea, 
bring it to you and you will consider it. Well, I have mentioned two 
bills here tonight. We have other ideas, and you have 2\1/2\, almost 3 
years left in your second term. You want a legacy? We are going to help 
you have a legacy, and a good one, but you have got to work with us. It 
is a two-way street.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.

                          ____________________

[Pages S8965-S8968]
                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to engage for perhaps the next 
20 or so minutes with Senator Cantwell, who is arriving shortly. I will 
begin with some remarks and ask unanimous consent for us to engage in a 
colloquy.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am here today to talk about the health care problem 
in the country, because I think the fixation of this body on the health 
care Web site has taken our eye off the fact we have a very significant 
and fundamental health care problem.
  This graph represents how much we spend on health care as a country. 
It begins back here in 1960. I was 5 years old in 1960. So this is a 
lifetime: 50-some years, $27.4 billion. That is what we spent on health 
care. Now here we are. This is up to 2011, and $2.7 trillion is what we 
spend on health care. It is 100 times as much in 50 years. Granted, 
there are more Americans but not 100 times as many.
  This has been an explosive cost growth curve. When we were trying to 
pass the health care bill, that is what we were looking at for costs. 
It is a big competitive problem for our country.
  This is a really interesting graph. I wish every time anybody talked 
about health care they would take 1 minute and look at this graph. I 
will explain briefly what it is.
  This column is the up access and measures life expectancy in years, 
country by country, 65 to 85, where countries fall in terms of their 
average life expectancy for their population, for their citizens. This 
along the bottom is the cost, the health spending per capita per person 
in that country. So if you measure it all out, what you see is a great 
raft of countries all through here: Japan, Great Britain, Netherlands, 
Switzerland, Norway, Italy, Greece. There is a whole large group of 
countries right here, and all of them have a life expectancy 80 or 
older and they all spend between $6,000 and $2,000 per person on their 
country's health care. Essentially the entire modernized, civilized 
world is in that zone, from here to here.
  Guess where the United States of America is. Boom. Here. We are below 
them all in life expectancy. We are trailing the pack of modern 
industrialized nations in our life expectancy. We are competing with 
Chile and the Czech Republic. But Japan, Greece, Great Britain, France, 
Germany, Luxembourg, all manage with their health care systems to 
achieve longer lifespans for their people. And we are doing it at a 
cost of about $8,500 per person per year.
  To give a comparison, here are Switzerland and Norway. They are the 
other two most expensive countries in the world per capita on health 
care spending, and they are at about $5,700 per year. If we could bring 
our per capita health care spending in this country down to the most 
expensive countries in the world, if we could compete head to head with 
the most expensive countries in the world, we would save more than $1 
trillion a year.
  This is an interesting graph because it shows basically all the 
modern industrialized nations here, and it shows us here as a way 
outlier. It is a big deal for us to be an outlier here, because it 
means we blow about $1 trillion a year in wasteful and unnecessary 
health care which could be building infrastructure, solving problems, 
reducing the deficit, and could be doing other work. Instead, we spend 
it on a health care system which doesn't produce good health care 
results--at least not measured by life expectancy, which is a pretty 
good proxy.
  There is a huge $1 trillion a year cost to our society in being that 
bad of an outlier. The cost is also measured in lost lives and lost 
years of life, because we are averaging 77 years and these countries 
are averaging 82 years of life.
  We have a real problem on our hands, and obsessing about a Web site 
is a complete distraction from getting after this problem--5 years off 
every human's life in this country and $1 trillion a year. That is 
worth paying attention to.
  The health care changes we brought are actually making a difference. 
Here are some interesting graphs. Each one is a projection done by the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office of what health care costs are 
going to look like in the future, and what you see is a progression. 
They did this graph in August of 2010. This was where they projected 
health care spending would go when they projected in August of 2010 for 
this period, from 2014 onward to the next decade. A year later they 
went back and they projected again, and they projected actually costs 
would be lower. Then they came back in August of 2012 and they did 
another projection, and their projection showed that these anticipated 
costs went down again, every year, lower and lower.
  Here is the big one. In May of this year, the Congressional Budget 
Office went back and redid its projections for Medicare and Medicaid 
spending from 2014 to 2023. Look how far below what they had projected 
1 year ago, 2 years ago, and 3 years ago the current projection. That 
is a saving of about $1.2 trillion in that decade.
  That is a long way from $1 trillion a year we could be saving if we 
just got back to where we were on this graph, if we got back from here 
to where Switzerland and Norway, the most expensive countries in the 
world, are. That is $1 trillion over 1 year. This is $1.2 trillion over 
10 years, but it is still a big change and it is still moving in the 
right direction. So we shouldn't be too quick to condemn ObamaCare when

[[Page S8966]]

that kind of savings is already being projected.
  The last slide I will show before I go to Senator Cantwell, who has 
been good enough to join us, is this one. Why might it be that those 
costs went down so far in May of 2013? Why might it be that graph of 
projected costs keeps going down? It is because of changes in what is 
going on in the health care system.
  This is one good example. This shows the hospital readmission rate 
from January of 2007 until August of 2013. This is how often somebody 
was discharged from the hospital, went home, and then within 30 days 
had to come back and be readmitted.
  That could potentially be for a completely new reason, but usually it 
is because the discharge planning wasn't done well enough and there was 
a bad handoff between the hospital and the primary care physician or 
the nursing home. What we found is you could make that transition much 
better for patients. When you do, guess what. They don't get sent back 
to the hospital. When they don't get sent back to the hospital, you 
save money.
  That is just one way the kind of huge $1.2 trillion over 10-year 
savings CBO has already projected could be taking place, but this is 
clearly a part of it. It is improving the quality of care so people 
aren't going back into the hospital, aren't going to the emergency 
room, and you avoid that cost at all by having handled the patient 
better, by having given them better treatment and better care.
  It is pretty astounding. In 2007, right through here until the end of 
2011, it was a pretty steady readmission rate. Then when we changed the 
signal to the hospitals and cut their payment for readmissions, boom, 
down it fell. That represents a very significant savings in the system. 
And in the personal lives of those people and their families not having 
to go back to the hospital, that is a pretty big plus too.
  It was Senator Cantwell's idea that we should come down today and 
talk a little bit about the delivery system reform side of the health 
care discussion. I got started a little bit before she could get here, 
but my wonderful colleague now has arrived, so let me yield the floor 
to her. I will put this graph back because I want to leave this here 
for whenever the camera swings my way. I want people to see this graph. 
It is inexcusable that all of these competitive industrialized nations 
of ours should be able to deliver universal high-quality health care 
for what would be a $1 trillion a year savings if we could simply match 
them, and they produce a longer life expectancy for their people and we 
are stuck competing for life expectancy with Chile and the Czech 
Republic. Come on. We can do a lot better than that, and that should be 
the ball we have our eye on rather than obsessing about the ObamaCare 
Web site.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my colleague 
from Rhode Island. I applaud him for his diligence, making sure this 
debate happened today, and for his leadership on this issue. It might 
sound kind of wonky to say there is a group of Senators that have a 
caucus called the Delivery System Reform Caucus, but we wear that 
banner with pride because we know that there are savings in our health 
care delivery system. We want to make sure that they are delivered for 
the American people.
  While some want to talk about cutting people off of service or 
raising certain ages, we are focused on the fact that there are 
hundreds of billions of dollars of savings in the delivery system and 
that it is our job to improve upon them. I like to say to my office 
team: There is a reason why Ma Bell doesn't exist anymore. The 
challenge is I have so many young people, and some of them don't 
remember Ma Bell. But the issue is the delivery system for 
telecommunications changed, and look at what it unleashed--a lot of 
great technology.
  Yes, change, but with ways to drive down costs and deliver better 
access. That is what we are talking about here with the health care 
system. My colleague from Rhode Island has had a group for more than a 
year that has been talking about these delivery system reforms. We are 
going to come out on a more frequent basis and try to have a dialog 
with our colleagues about why it is so important.
  We have taken a small but very important step led by our senior 
Senator from Washington Senator Murray on the budget. But there is so 
much more we can do if we can include these delivery system reforms. So 
I thank Senator Whitehouse, the Senator from Rhode Island, for his 
leadership.
  I want to talk about one area today, the area of long-term care 
services. I authored a provision in the Affordable Care Act called the 
Balancing Incentive Payments Program. While that sounds in and of 
itself like a wonky title, Balancing Incentive Payments Program, this 
program is really there to promote home and community-based care over 
nursing home care. If you ask any senior they will say of course they 
would like to receive health care services in their home or in their 
community. No, they do not want to go to a nursing home. But the 
discussion has been limited on how much cheaper it is and how much 
better the care could be for delivery in the home as opposed to nursing 
home care.
  According to a survey by AARP, over 90 percent of seniors age 50 or 
over desire to remain in their home as long as possible. We know that 
home and community-based care is 70 percent cheaper than nursing home 
care--70 percent cheaper. So for us in Washington State we thought 
about this long ago, and we decided that we were going to implement a 
system to reform our State and put more community-based care in our 
State and pull Medicaid patients away from nursing home care. We did 
that. We successfully made that transition. This chart shows you what I 
was just referring to, that home-based care can be as little as $1,200 
a person versus the same person getting care in an institutional 
facility at $6,000.
  We made the transition in Washington State to be predominantly a home 
and community-based care State. We did that with our own State dollars, 
our own program, and it was a transition that took place over many 
years. We are kind of the antithesis of what the Federal system is. It 
is still more weighted on a State by State basis towards nursing home 
care. That means people are going into nursing home care, and we are 
footing the bill for more expensive care at $6,000 per person when we 
could have services in the community that would allow them to stay in 
their home and get more efficient care. So in 2009, the long-term care 
budget overall for Medicaid accounted for 32 percent of the Medicaid 
expenditures or $360 billion a year. You can see that this is a very 
expensive area for us at the Federal level. If we could do anything to 
help change those numbers, we would be delivering an improvement to the 
system.
  When we first made this transition from 1995 to 2008, the State of 
Washington saved $243 million from this investment. But more important, 
even, than the money--in an article in 2010, the Spokesman Review in 
Spokane ran a story called ``Dying to live at home,'' the family of 
Nancy and Paul Dunham, a couple of more than 60 years, said they wanted 
to age at home. Because of the Medicaid funding for in-home services, 
they were able to stay. Mr. Dunham was able to stay in his home until 
the age of 83.
  I am sure many of my colleagues know people who are getting on in 
years who prefer to stay at home. But the Balancing Incentives Program, 
which was in the Affordable Care Act, was the first Federal effort that 
we had that tried to assist States to move away from nursing home care 
and move towards community-based care. We put some incentives in the 
program. Here are the States so far that have taken up the Federal 
Government in the Affordable Care Act on this incentive program: New 
Hampshire, Maryland, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, 
Indiana, Connecticut, Arkansas, New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Ohio, 
Maine, and Illinois.
  It is a diverse group of States, I might add. Some States, probably, 
where Governors said they did not want to support the Affordable Care 
Act yet are taking advantage of this provision. Some States probably 
are forerunners of delivery system reform and have done lots of 
delivery system reform and want to do more. It is a mix

[[Page S8967]]

of States. I think we have a lot of great examples in those States and 
what we can do to transition away from institutional care to home and 
community-based care.
  The program authorizes grants to States to increase access to their 
non-institutional long-term care services, and it supports including 
structural changes that help streamline the system--conflict-free case 
management, core standardization of assessment instruments, single 
entry-point systems so it is not confusing, so that the system is very 
streamlined. States have until September of 2015 to increase their 
long-term care services in the community and support expenditures of 
these noninstitutional-based care facilities.
  We are very excited that it has had a robust uptake by these States. 
I am encouraged that there has been so much interest shown in changing 
the political orientation, if you will, of States, to how do you deal 
with long-term care. We know everybody is living longer. We know as 
baby boomers retire, it is going to be a bubble to our health care 
delivery system. But this is an excellent idea, a way for us to deliver 
better care.
  What does it do? As I said in the first chart, $1,200 versus $6,000 
in nursing home care. It reduces costs. Reducing those costs has to be 
a key focus for us.
  These Medicaid recipients are people who maybe even start on Medicare 
but because of the extreme cost of health care at the end of life, end 
up spending it out, end up on Medicaid, end up being a Federal 
responsibility. If we can reduce those costs by driving more community-
based care, it is a win-win situation.
  The second thing it does is it helps improve quality. If people can 
stay at home and get access to the delivery system by these new 
requirements, making sure it is case managed and has the single point 
of entry and standardization of the home care system, it helps us to be 
efficient about the quality of care that is being delivered. Again, 
when you have a community-based setting, either in the home or where 
care is delivered through the home, there are lots of ways for us to 
have checks and balances on the system.
  I have talked to many people who are in the nursing home industry. 
They will say we like the idea that we are only going to take the 
sickest patients. We like the idea we are only going to serve people 
who really need to be there as opposed to some people who may not be 
ready for those facilities but end up there anyway just because there 
are not the community efforts to support it.
  Besides reducing costs and improving quality, we save money. That is 
why we are here today, to talk about these important ideas that save 
money. This is a simple one, but it is already in place. It has already 
started. There are many States taking us up on this offer, but it is 
critical that we understand and score these costs because they can show 
how we can save billions of dollars in our health care delivery system.
  I know my colleagues, some of them on the other side of the aisle--
well, all of them on the other side of the aisle--didn't support the 
Affordable Care Act. Take a second look at what your States are doing. 
Your States are supporting the legislation, at least through one 
provision. I think when you check, you will see that one provision is 
going to save your State money. It is going to give your citizens 
better choice in their quality of care. It is going to help us reduce 
our Federal costs and expenditures as well, and that is what delivery 
system reform is all about.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?
  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes, I will.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Isn't it the heart of what the Senator said just a 
moment ago that there is an area that actually touches on a lot of 
health care--it is a big area--where you can do two things at once? You 
can save significant money for taxpayers and insurance ratepayers, and 
at the same time you can improve the quality of care that people 
receive.
  So often in legislative matters it is a zero sum game. One wins so 
the other has to lose exactly by the same amount. This is not like 
that. This is a win-win situation. So there really should be energetic 
efforts to pursue these win-win opportunities.
  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for that 
question. I think his charts pointed to the fact that he was 
articulating, the fact that everybody is arguing about the Web site. As 
somebody who has been involved in a software company that wrote code, 
what happened is very unfortunate, but writing code and fixing it is a 
straightforward task that can be achieved. It is a little less 
difficult than cleaning up oil in the gulf or something of larger 
environmental impact.
  To me, we will get that fixed. In the meantime, there are a lot of 
things that have to happen, that need to change in our delivery system 
that are about saving costs, delivering better quality care, that we 
know are proven, successful answers to this question. We need to get 
more than just these States to take us up on this offer. We need to get 
CBO to actually give us a score on how much money this has the 
potential of saving, and then we have to figure out a way to 
incentivize all other States to implement this as soon as possible.
  When you think about our senior population, this is what they want. 
They want to stay at home as long as possible. It is so much cheaper 
per Medicaid beneficiary to do this.
  This is what we have to achieve. We hope by coming out here and 
educating people about the various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, 
the things in the delivery system reform that are on the agenda to 
improve access and help save costs, that this will start taking hold 
and we will get more people talking about these solutions. This is 
absolutely the direction we need to go.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I could ask the Senator another question in 
response to what she just said, not only is it a win-win, being lower 
cost and better quality care, but I believe the Senator said that there 
is actually a third win here. There is the win of lower cost, there is 
the win of better quality care, but for seniors there is a huge win of 
maintaining your independence and being able to stay at home. It is 
hard to put a price on that, but if you are facing the choice of having 
to leave your home and having to go to a more restrictive health care 
setting, being able to stay at home is a very big plus.
  Really, it is not win-win, it is win-win-win.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. 
He is correct. There are the individuals who win. The State in this 
case saves Medicaid dollars, and the Federal Government saves dollars 
as well. But to the individual, if you ask them, this is their choice. 
They want to stay at home. Nobody says they want to go into nursing 
care.
  We appreciate the nursing home care delivery aspect of health care. 
They deal with some of the most complex patients. But they do not need 
to deal with people who do not need to be there. We have to have a 
delivery system that helps support community-based care for long-term 
care. I hope that we will get more support for these ideas and that we 
will help figure out a way to get a score for them as well. I think 
that part of the misery in this whole issue of health care savings is 
figuring out ways to do things that are not so complex in what they are 
doing. Moving from nursing home care to community-based care, $1,200 
versus $6,000, that is not the hard part of the equation. What is hard 
is to get CBO to guesstimate how much population would be affected.
  We do know this. If you take the number of seniors to be affected as 
the baby boomer population reaches that retirement age, if you think 
they are going to be supported primarily by nursing home care--I think 
I am correct that our State has now made the shift so the majority of 
our people who are on Medicaid are taken care of by long-term care 
services in the community if they are seeking those services, versus 
the Federal numbers which are just the opposite. The majority of people 
seeking those Medicaid long-term care dollars, the average of those 
States is more towards nursing home care. We need to flip that. The 
Senator is right, it would be a win-win-win situation for all of us.
  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership on this 
issue.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, in responding to what Senator Cantwell

[[Page S8968]]

just said about the Congressional Budget Office, it indeed has been 
frustrating and bedeviling to run up against their inability to project 
these savings in a way that would allow us to--what we call in 
Washington--score them and get budget credit for them. But even though 
they have that difficulty, there are some very serious organizations 
that project that very significant savings of the kind I have 
mentioned--the $1 trillion savings--are possible.
  Some years ago the President's own Council of Economic Advisers 
estimated that we could do savings of $700 billion without affecting 
the quality of care in any way for the worse.
  The National Institute of Medicine has made several regular 
projections. The most recent one is $750 billion a year. The Institute 
of Medicine is pretty serious folks, and they are entitled to respect 
when they say we can have those kinds of savings.
  RAND Corporation--a lot of people know a lot about it--is a very 
expert organization. They have done two things. They looked at what we 
can save in health care, and then they looked at what we can save in 
health care plus an additional bit for dealing with waste and fraud. 
They gave ranges for the two. The midpoint of the range for savings is 
about $730 billion. If we add their suggestions on waste and fraud, the 
midpoint of their range goes to about $910 billion a year.
  The Lewin Group, which is another respected think tank that looks at 
health care issues, wrote a piece some time ago with George Bush's 
former Treasury Secretary, and they said it was $1 trillion.
  So is it $700 billion a year? Is it $750 billion a year? Is it 
somewhere between $730 and $910 billion a year depending on how you 
score the waste and fraud? Is it $1 trillion a year? Either way, I will 
take it. Those are big numbers, and wherever it falls in that range, we 
should be energetically fighting for it.
  I will close with the request I always make in these speeches--and 
this is a request to the President and to his administration--and that 
is to inspire us and set a bold national target. Sure, CBO, OMB, and 
our actuarial and accounting organizations cannot predict what these 
savings are going to be, but, by gosh, the President can direct his 
administration to target a savings goal and to go after it. I think if 
the President were to set a hard date and dollar target for delivery 
system savings--a couple of years out so we have a chance to do that--
that would make a big difference.
  The example that I use is of President Kennedy. Back in 1961, when it 
looked as if we were losing the space race to the Soviet Union, 
President Kennedy declared that within 10 years--he put a date on it--
he would put a man on the Moon and bring him back safely. He had a hard 
target, something specific so you would know if it was or wasn't 
achieved. The message was clear, the mission that was outlined was 
clear, and the result was a vast mobilization of private and public 
resources to achieve that purpose.
  It is not enough to talk about bending the health care cost curve. 
That catchphrase should be jettisoned and discarded. We should have a 
hard date and dollar figure, and that should be a target the entire 
administration aims toward.
  Had President Kennedy given that speech back in 1961 and declared as 
his purpose to bend the curve of space exploration, I very much doubt 
we would have put that man on the Moon within 10 years. It was his 
exercise of Presidential leadership and challenge--ahead of what the 
scientists knew could be done but with confidence and faith in our 
ability to achieve big things--that put the executive branch of 
government into focus so we could achieve exactly what he had directed. 
We can do the same with health care. We should do the same with health 
care. There is no downside to it because this is a win-win area, as I 
discussed with Senator Cantwell.
  On that note, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I asked my colleague from Rhode Island 
to stay on the floor for a couple of minutes because I wanted to thank 
him for the erudite and eloquent explanation he has just given for why 
our focus should be so aggressively and unrelentingly on the tremendous 
opportunities for saving health care costs and raising health care 
quality at the same time. I am very proud to have joined him and other 
colleagues in a task force that is seeking commonsense solutions to 
lower the costs of health care and at the same time increase its 
efficiency and quality. The two go together.
  The phenomenon he just discussed of reducing readmissions to 
hospitals once patients are discharged also means that the quality of 
those discharges, the rehabilitation plans and hand-offs to primary 
physicians, and the suffering and pain for those patients is reduced, 
and that is just a microcosm of one example of how this goal can be 
accomplished.
  We are late in this year, and we have no real time remaining before 
the end of this year to do the kinds of reforms legislatively that will 
help advance this ball. But the attention we need to devote to this 
issue is clearly beyond this year and beyond the next year.
  We are making progress, and the graphs show it, but there is so much 
progress to be made in extending lifespans and quality of life as well 
as reducing the cost of health care.
  We need to make sure we seize this historic moment to show the rest 
of the world that we can do better and we will do better in providing 
health care delivery. The cause of health care delivery reform is one 
that cries out for a focused effort involving both branches of our 
government, executive and legislative, and both parties, as well as 
both Houses of this legislature.
  The kind of focus given by Senators Cantwell and Whitehouse so 
penetratingly and powerfully today is the kind of focus we should 
maintain. I hope in the days or months ahead we will devote more 
attention by coming to the floor, doing events in our States, and 
making sure the administration is aware of our concern in meetings. I 
look forward to continuing that effort in the time ahead.
  Again, I thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse, as well as others, 
such as Senator Schumer and my colleague from Connecticut Senator 
Murphy, as well as Senator Cantwell, for their devoted efforts. I am 
very proud to be working with them.
  I see my colleagues are on the Senate floor. It is late in the day, 
and I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.
  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I would point out that the distinguished 
Senator from Delaware was on his way to speak and has graciously 
offered to defer for moment or two while I make my brief remarks.

                        HON. JOHN C. CARNEY, JR.

                              of delaware

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 7, 2012

  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my thoughts about 
the tax on medical devices.
  The House voted on H.R. 436, the Health Care Cost Reduction Act of 
2012. This bill would have repealed the 2.3 percent tax on medical 
devices that was instituted to pay for the Affordable Care Act. While I 
did not support H.R. 436, I recognize that medical device makers are at 
the forefront of innovation and that Federal legislation should support 
those efforts. I am concerned about the impact that the medical device 
tax will have on American jobs. Particularly during these difficult 
economic times, I believe we must do everything we can to encourage, 
not stifle, job creation.
  I believe the Affordable Care Act will provide critical health care 
coverage to millions of Americans, and I also believe that paying for 
it responsibly is important. I did not support H.R. 436 because I do 
not believe that Americans already struggling to afford the cost of 
healthcare coverage should bear the burden of eliminating this tax. 
Moreover, I believe we should refrain from making significant changes 
to the funding structure of the Affordable Care Act until the Supreme 
Court has rendered its decision on the constitutionality of the law. At 
that time, the House should revisit repealing the medical device tax 
with an offset that protects American families while being fiscally 
responsible.

                         HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 7, 2012

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 436 is primarily focused on 
dismantling the Affordable Care Act, which is why I will oppose it 
today.
  Medical devices offer important benefits to individuals throughout 
the country. In some cases they save lives; in other cases, they 
improve the quality of life. An important part of the Affordable Care 
Act was to expand access to the benefits of medical devices by making 
health insurance more affordable. Indeed, as a result of the Affordable 
Care Act, over 30 million more Americans will have access to affordable 
care. This is good for the individuals, and it is also good for the 
manufacturers of these devices, who will now have more people who can 
afford their products.
  Now, the medical device industry apparently wants to keep the 
benefits of having more insured people capable of benefiting from their 
products without contributing to the effort that allows those 
individuals to afford their coverage in the first place. If every group 
that joined the effort to expand insurance coverage took that approach, 
the entire health care reform effort would fall apart--which is 
precisely the outcome the Republican majority is seeking with this 
legislation.
  Additionally, rather than finding a different way to pay for 
extending affordable health insurance to over 30 million Americans, 
this repeal--and the rest of the bill--is offset by eliminating 
existing protections for middle and lower-income citizens who receive 
tax credits for insurance they purchase on the exchange, a change the 
nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates will increase the 
ranks of the uninsured by 350,000.
  While I would support the provision in this bill allowing health care 
flexible spending account holders to recover up to $500 in unspent 
funds from their FSAs if it came before the House as a freestanding 
bill, the vast majority of this legislation is clearly aimed at 
undermining the Affordable Care Act.
  Accordingly, I urge a ``no'' vote.

                          ____________________

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this afternoon, I was supposed to be in 
Memphis with the head of the faith-based group from Washington. Because 
of the sequester, she wasn't able to travel. Because of the shutdown, 
I'm here.
  So we had 42 pastors come to my office with the navigators in 
Memphis, and we talked about the Affordable Care Act and how to sign up 
people in the community and what the Affordable Care Act did. It was a 
very beneficial program in telling people in the community how to sign 
people up for needed and important health care. I wish others would do 
the same thing. It would be constructive.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the 
land. We need to help our citizens get adjusted, get involved, and get 
the benefits.

                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I heard the same thing on the Republican 
side of the aisle: Why doesn't the President compromise?
  The bottom line is that the President is always willing to negotiate 
on the issues of the budget, as are the House Democrats. But what we 
are seeing from the GOP is that they just want to kill the Affordable 
Care Act. That's what this is all about. They do not want the 
Affordable Care Act to proceed.
  I know for myself that in my district there are plenty of people who 
just can't wait until October 1. They don't have insurance, they want a 
good benefit package. It makes absolutely no sense to link the budget, 
which has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, and 
say, Well, we want to kill that because we don't like it.
  We had an election last November. Less than a year ago, President 
Obama said he was going to continue with the Affordable Care Act, and 
his opponent said, no, he would repeal it, and the President won. This 
is over. The Republicans should not continue to come back and insist 
that there be changes, repeal, defunding of the Affordable Care Act. 
That's not the way this government operates.
  No one on the Republican side of the aisle has asked to sit down with 
the Democrats, and no one on the Republican side of the aisle has 
suggested they'll do anything, but they have to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act. That's what this is all about, and it should not be, Mr. 
Speaker.

                       AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania). The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, the health care marketplaces are finally open. 
The only complaint is that people are so eager to learn more about 
their options and to sign up that too many people logged on yesterday.
  Now, to hear my colleagues from across the aisle describe this day, 
you might expect to look out the window and witness the beginning of, 
as ``Ghostbusters'' once put it, 40 years of darkness--earthquakes, 
volcanos, the dead rising from the grave, dogs and cats living 
together, mass hysteria. Perhaps these warnings were overblown.
  The start of the Affordable Care Act resulted in exactly zero people 
locked out of their offices with their paychecks on hold. By contrast, 
the Republican shutdown has furloughed 800,000 Federal employees.
  Exactly zero people yesterday were deprived of their annual flu shots 
because of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, ObamaCare has made 
preventive care for things like vaccines free, without copay, to 
insured patients nationwide. By contrast, the Republican shutdown has 
forced the CDC to halt its annual seasonal influenza program, just as 
flu season is getting underway.
  Because of the Affordable Care Act, exactly zero infants yesterday 
were deprived of healthy food and nutrition information. By contrast, 
the Republican shutdown has put at risk the entire Women, Infants, and 
Children program, which provides some 9 million Americans with the 
support they need to feed their children.
  The Republican shutdown has also brought to a standstill critical 
lifesaving biomedical research being conducted at the NIH and NSF. 
Exactly zero people yesterday went untreated because of the ACA for 
foodborne illnesses. By contrast, the Republican shutdown has forced 
the FDA to cease many of its food safety operations.
  The Affordable Care Act has not ushered in an era of doom and gloom 
that the Republicans promised. Instead, it has offered hope and 
opportunity for good health care coverage.
  Here is the reality: The ACA is helping my constituents who 
previously found health insurance out of reach. The access provided by 
ACA is long overdue. Rather than seek delay, we should be embracing it.
  For years I've been hearing from people like Nicole, from Lawrence, 
who writes not about the fear of the ACA but, rather, ``the fear that 
the health care of your family will bankrupt you and that your lack of 
resources will leave you and your loved ones vulnerable to sickness and 
death.''
  Now, I also hear optimism--optimism--that comes from the options that 
can now be found in the new marketplace. Just ask Mary, from Princeton, 
who wrote me earlier this week:

       Please do not allow the implementation of ObamaCare to be 
     delayed. I've been waiting and waiting for a time when my 
     adult children would be able to afford health insurance.

  She goes on to say that the health care marketplace has given her 
``the opportunity to review plans with them and to assist them to 
choose the best plan.''
  There is the single mother from Scotch Plains who wrote me:

       I am a registered Republican, and I am embarrassed by all 
     that has been happening for the last few days. The Tea Party 
     and some Republicans keep yelling that they're speaking for 
     the people. Well, they're not speaking for me or anyone I 
     know.
       ObamaCare must be given a chance. I have been without 
     coverage since my COBRA ended 2 years ago. I was unable to 
     get reasonable coverage at a reasonable rate. I don't want 
     charity; I'm not looking for a handout. I want affordable 
     health care. I've been praying I stay healthy. I'm patiently 
     waiting for the affordable care exchanges so that I can 
     finally try my luck there. Please, please don't let the Tea 
     Party take this away from me and so many others who need it.

  Now, I wish my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would accept 
this as the good news that it is. I wish they would accept that their 
stories of doom and gloom for ObamaCare were wrong. But instead, we're 
learning that the dire stories were not a prediction, they were a 
threat.
  The Tea Party, confronted with the prospect of a duly passed law that 
has been upheld by the Supreme Court, have thrown a temper tantrum. 
They have taken hostage the entire Federal Government, and they have 
sabotaged the process of self-government--all to

[[Page H6111]]

prevent Americans from gaining access to affordable health care.
  Let's make the health care law work as well as possible. Let's, 
together, make our other government services--necessary services--work 
as well as possible.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy my friends on the other side 
of the aisle, some really terrific public speakers. I also enjoyed 
particularly the question from my friend across the aisle who said: 
``Why not let ObamaCare just go through?''
  That is something that has been debated and I have discussed with so 
many of my constituents. There are many people in the country that are 
so angry about ObamaCare being passed. It is just hard to call it 
``affordable care'' because I have heard from so many that it has just 
devastated, so many who have told me that it is anything but 
affordable. It is devastating them.
  Some have said if we just let ObamaCare go through, it is going to 
hurt so many people. It has already hurt so many people. If we just let 
it go through--stand by, just get out of the way, let it hit, let it 
get the full hurt and damage that will continue--that will just get 
worse as it hurts the economy as it continues to make most people's 
health care and health insurance both go up.
  If you are a purely political animal, that is the perfect question to 
ask: Why not just let ObamaCare go through and let it do its damage?
  But when you care deeply about people and see the damage it is doing, 
how can you stand by and let it keep hurting the way it is? People have 
already lost insurance, they've already gotten their notices, we 
continue to get emails, we continue to get calls, I continue to hear 
from people I know and trust back home, I hear from other people around 
the country.
  There has been an email where people could send us their stories and 
then we try to verify: ObamaCare@mail.house
.gov. So those stories continue to come in at ObamaCare@mail.house.gov.
  So if you are purely a political animal, whether Republican or 
Democrat, then it is a good question to ask: Why not just let ObamaCare 
come through? Because if it is as bad as people are telling us it is--
you see the damage to the economy, you see the people that have lost 
full-time work and gone to part-time work because of it, having to take 
multiple jobs, losing the benefits they had, you see businesses that 
had cultivated and trained employees, who did not want to lose 
employees, who were building and building but got above the 50 
threshold and now they have had to cut below that or go to part time, 
you see the damage--then, yes, for purely political animals why not let 
it go through?
  As my friend noted, if it is all that bad you will win the next 
election, the majority in the Senate next time, you will win the 
Presidency next time.
  But there are some of us that don't think in purely political terms. 
We hear from people--our hearts break when their hearts break, we 
rejoice when they rejoice--and it is hard to feel good and stand by and 
let a train wreck or a nightmare, depending on which Democrat's 
description of ObamaCare you want, just let it go and continue to wreak 
havoc on America and real American people, on American lives.
  We've mentioned some of the stories before. As I say, they continue 
to come in to ObamaCare@mail.house.gov.
  Here is one from Jeff:

       I run a business in Tyler. We have part-time associates 
     that work 35 hours per week on average. But this varies due 
     to the changing business levels. We provide transportation 
     services moving freight to and from Tyler. Since the 
     implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we have had to cut 
     down hours of these associates to get below the employer-
     mandated level of 30 hours. These associates are used to 
     working 35 hours on average per week. As most Americans, they 
     set their budget for their family around this many hours. Our 
     company needs to be able to compete in this market so we need 
     the flexibility of the part-time worker. However, we must now 
     cut hours of loyal, dedicated associates below 29 hours. This 
     is creating a problem, first for our associates, who are 
     simply trying to make ends meet, and for the organization 
     that I run to provide quality service to our customers. This 
     law is handcuffing the businesses and will ultimately drive 
     up costs of running a company. When costs rise they are 
     passed along to the customers and on to the end consumer. We 
     will continue to struggle economically under this law. Please 
     do whatever you can to reverse this law and restore liberty 
     to this country and our businesses.

  Here is one from Tammy:

       When ObamaCare first passed its law, I asked my ObGyn what 
     he thought of it. His words were that it ``sucks.'' I told my 
     husband that I bet when all this is said and done he would 
     retire. And guess what? He did. So the part about being able 
     to keep your doctor is definitely not true. Also, I own a 
     small business with less than 50 employees, and we will never 
     be able to grow our business any bigger than what it is right 
     now. Sad.

  From Tammy.
  Mary said:

       We had insurance through Moen in my retirement package, 
     which cost us $27 per month. It has been canceled effective 
     January 1 of 2014 and comparable coverage is going to cost us 
     $300 per month. We are on Social Security.

  That is from Walter and Mary in east Texas.
  Here is one from Harold:

       My granddaughter teaches elementary students in Mesquite. 
     She was shocked to find that the health insurance she carries 
     on herself and her son has doubled in cost since the school 
     year. She inquired as to why. And well, you already know what 
     the answer she was given: ObamaCare.

  A single mom and her son.
  Here is another from a business owner:

       I have been told that my company offers what is known as a 
     Cadillac health plan, although it has been years since anyone 
     in my

[[Page H6219]]

     company could afford a Cadillac automobile. As a small 
     business, I use the ability to offer health care that was 
     superior to others to attract and retain quality, longtime 
     employees. Now faced with being taxed for providing too 
     much of a good thing I will reduce the benefits to my 
     employees. We call that a ``left-handed handshake'' in 
     Texas. It doesn't sit well with me. I am sure not well 
     with my employees. I am considering early retirement and 
     closing or selling my business all together. It just 
     doesn't seem to matter to anyone anymore that hard work 
     and doing the right thing all these years ever counted for 
     anything. Here is hoping some folks will pull their heads 
     out of--before it is too late.
       I was part of Tenet's reduction in force on June 21, 2013. 
     With low hospital census and poor CMS reimbursement my 
     position was eliminated. I lost the family health care. I was 
     paying $2,062 annually with a family deductible of $2,400 for 
     our medical, dental, prescription, and eye insurance. For 
     COBRA or Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance we will now have to 
     pay $1,000 per month or $12,000 annually. My employment will 
     not cover the cost of my insurance.

  That's from Claudia.

       I am a firefighter with the city of Whitehouse, Texas. We 
     have been able until October 1, 2013, to work up to 39 hours 
     a week because the city cannot afford to give us benefits. 
     The city asked us if we could get on our spouse's group 
     insurance I could still work up to 39 hours a week with the 
     new health care law. I joined my wife's group policy and went 
     from paying $189 a month to $600 per month. We have been told 
     as of October 1, 2013, that Texas Municipal insurance has 
     interpreted the new health care law as anyone working over 30 
     hours a week has to be provided health benefits. We are now 
     going to be cut back to working 24 hours a week and not get 
     health care. I have left my wife's plan and went back to my 
     own insurance policy, but with the cuts in hours I cannot 
     afford to stay on her plan and will have a hard time paying 
     for my own.
       I cannot understand, if the new health plan is going to get 
     health insurance for everyone and I already have insurance, 
     why can't I be left alone to work the 39 hours a week? At $13 
     an hour, 24 hours a week doesn't bring in much for the job we 
     are expected to do, and at 61 years of age jobs are kind of 
     scarce. I can't understand why my country is trying to put me 
     on welfare. We have too many on it already. All I want to do 
     is work.

  From John.
  Here is one from Kerri:

       I've been in law enforcement since I was 21, and what is 
     happening to our officers, dispatchers, and deputies today is 
     disgusting. Many rural counties, like mine where I'm from, 
     have voted in County Commissioners Court and actually passed 
     that because of ObamaCare, the deputies will have to pay for 
     their own medical insurance. These officers are already being 
     paid below what surrounding counties are being paid. Now they 
     are going to have to spend over half of their income on their 
     own insurance because the county cannot afford to pay it. Let 
     me break this down for you. A good friend of mine is employed 
     as a deputy by the same county sheriff's office and makes 
     about $900 every 2 weeks and $400 to $450 of that will now go 
     towards medical insurance. This deputy was almost killed in 
     the line of duty 2 years ago, resulting in a lot of surgeries 
     and a year of hospitalization and rehabilitation as well. 
     Because of all of those line-of-duty injuries he may not be 
     able to get private coverage now. How could you ask a man or 
     woman to lay their life on the line every day, to serve the 
     public and enforce laws, but then tell them that they'll go 
     from spending about $150 a month on insurance premiums to 
     about $450 per month.

                              {time}  1815

  It's true that you should be able to go to the exchanges, and if they 
can ever get through and someday get it, it's not going to have the 
coverage that they had before. They've lost their insurance. They won't 
have insurance like that again. It won't be the coverage that they'd 
wanted, that they'd selected, that they'd agreed on. Why? Because, if 
you like your insurance, ObamaCare makes sure you're not likely to keep 
it. That's the bottom line.
  Here is one from Ima:

       Due to ObamaCare, I received a letter from my doctor 2 
     weeks ago, telling me she would no longer take care of anyone 
     on Medicare. There is a big shortage of doctors that will 
     accept Medicare patients in such a small town as Lufkin. I 
     haven't been able to get another doctor to accept me as of 
     this date. I never thought I would live to experience my own 
     government treating us like we were a Communist nation. Our 
     Congress has truly let the American people down.

  I'm sure Ima remembers being told repeatedly by everyone--from the 
President and by so many of our Democratic colleagues here--that if you 
like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Well, Ima lost her doctor 
like so many across America.
  Here is one from Jay in east Texas:

       My son returned from a tour in Iraq to an economy that 
     hindered his job search for over a year. He finally got a job 
     with Fastenal as a part-time warehouse worker. As a part-
     timer, he was able to work 39 hours every week, which paid 
     his bills and allowed him to put aside some savings for pilot 
     training. Thanks to ObamaCare, his hours have been cut to 29. 
     He has had to move out of his apartment and into a communal 
     house so he can afford to live. Thankfully, he has VA health 
     benefits. Otherwise, he would have to pay for health benefits 
     or a fine out of his greatly reduced income.

  This is from Jim:

       My son has a learning disability. Yet he has worked 
     faithfully for a nationwide paint company for over 3 years. 
     He is married. He and his wife work hard and refuse to go on 
     welfare. They have their dignity, a life vision and a 
     committed work ethic. Yet the best position he had attained 
     was part time at the paint company. He was working 32 hours 
     per week, and they were paying their bills, but were living 
     basically at the poverty line.
       Then ObamaCare came, and like so many companies, my son's 
     hours were reduced to 28 hours per week. This put him below 
     the poverty line and made it impossible to meet all of his 
     bills. He refused to pursue welfare because he has a 
     commitment to earn what he receives. ObamaCare punished 
     diligent, community, responsible Americans like my son.
       How many other working poor have been similarly hurt 
     because of a program that was put in place with such 
     irresponsible legislative leadership?

  If someone wonders what James is talking about regarding 
irresponsible legislative leadership, that came through a legislative 
process without any input from Republicans, who represented nearly half 
of the country, so nearly half of the country didn't get any input into 
ObamaCare. We were told it would be negotiated on C-SPAN by the 
President while he was running. Not only was it not negotiated on C-
SPAN, but the legislative leaders in this room--in this body--who 
pushed it through without most of the people who voted for it, haven't 
any idea what is in it. I read it. That's why I was so committed to 
voting against it and to trying to get others to understand what they 
were going to do to America.
  So, for this young man, who had known the pride of being self-
supporting with a disability and providing for his family just above 
the poverty line, ObamaCare has shoved him into poverty.
  Here is one from Michelle with two ``l's.'' It's not my friend, 
Michele Bachmann. This is from a Texas ``Michelle.'' She sent this last 
week:

       During this process and even before ObamaCare actually goes 
     into full effect, every single member of my family has been 
     affected. Both of my children, who have always maintained 
     full-time jobs and have supported their families are now 
     faced with part-time employment from multiple jobs because 
     their employers can't afford to provide health insurance any 
     longer, and as such, their hours have been reduced to avoid 
     having to provide health insurance. That means my children 
     and my grandchildren are all going to be forced into the 
     exchanges, which are not affordable at all despite the empty 
     promises made by the Democratic Party when this horrible bill 
     was passed.
       In fact, please tell our former Speaker that, now that 
     everyone has had a chance to read it, it's even more obvious 
     that this plan does not work.
       On my side, I've always maintained health insurance, but 
     since the passage of ObamaCare, my health premiums have 
     increased over 316 percent. In addition, my deductibles have 
     skyrocketed by 500 percent, and the covered services have 
     been reduced. So thank you for allowing me to keep my health 
     care coverage if I chose to. You didn't mention that it would 
     now be unaffordable.

  Here is one from Leland:

       ``A dark age in medicine.'' That was the phrase my 
     oncologist, at a recent office visit, used. He said, When you 
     cut reimbursements as low as Medicare and ObamaCare have 
     done, the number of patients I must see to cover the fixed 
     costs of my practice severely impacts the time I can spend 
     with a single patient. Quality of care can't help but be 
     impacted.

  If Leland has an oncologist, I hope and pray that his cancer is in 
remission.
  It was amazing to hear Democrats say, Hey, yeah. Okay. Maybe we did 
cut Medicare in ObamaCare by over $700 billion. I'm not sure if I hear 
them talk about the amount by which they devastated Medicare. Hey--but 
that only goes to the providers. It does not affect and will not affect 
your care.
  As you can find out from Leland, it does affect their care, and as 
we've heard from other people across the country, when you cut so 
dramatically the reimbursement that a health care provider gets 
for providing health care service, either they're going to have to stop 
providing that service or they cannot provide the same level or quality 
of service.

[[Page H6220]]

  Seniors across America are one by one figuring that out. Wow, wait a 
minute. You were so sold on this ObamaCare bill, and you called it 
``affordable.'' Yet you told me I wasn't going to be affected as a 
senior citizen in America when you cut hundreds of billions of dollars 
out from the services I was going to get? They're figuring it out. 
Their service has been affected, and it will get worse and worse as 
time goes on because that's what the government does. When the 
government takes over something, it's rare that it gets better.
  Here we've got one from Nick:

       The American Veterinary Medical Association has decided, 
     because of the uncertainties of ObamaCare, to discontinue its 
     sponsorship of its group major medical policy, effective 
     December 1, 2013. Not only have my wife and I had this 
     insurance since she graduated from vet school in 1976, but my 
     dad also had it when he graduated from vet school in 1952. So 
     now, at the age of 61, we are looking for new insurance.

  I'm sure Nick recalls the promise: if you like your insurance, oh, 
you can keep it.
  Here is an email from Debbie:

       I am responding by letting you know that I've lost my 
     health care insurance. It's terminating at the end of this 
     year due to ObamaCare.

  Of course, we have her name and information.
  One from Tom:

       My doctor retired as a result of ObamaCare.

  That's somebody who served in the Army.
  Here is one from Emily:

       We had group insurance with my husband's work. It was a 
     plan that covered our family that cost $568 a month, no co-
     pay, and the $1,200 deductible per person has now increased 
     to $1,100 per month and a $4,800 deductible per person to 
     stay current with new health care laws. That's more than our 
     house payment. Once upon a time, a mother whose husband 
     worked was able to stay home. Now either both have to work to 
     afford a thing like insurance or neither works so we can bum 
     off the people who do.

  Her subject line was: ``Unaffordable rather than Affordable.'' But 
her insurance went from $568 a month, which is a pretty healthy price 
there, basically doubling to $1,100 per month, and the no co-pay 
deductible went from $1,200 per person to $4,800 per person. That's 
enough to devastate a family.
  Here is one from James:

       Several months ago, we got a letter in the mail saying that 
     our physician--and I won't give the name--was leaving her 
     affiliated practice. When we asked her about it, she listed 
     ObamaCare as the primary reason for leaving the practice.

  Here is one from Ty:

       I just received my affordable health care renewal notice 
     from my health care insurance provider, which is one of the 
     two members participating in North Carolina's marketplace 
     exchange. I've been informed that the plan which I currently 
     have and like will no longer be available under ObamaCare. As 
     a result, I'm being forced to switch to a new plan. 
     Additionally, effective January 1, 2014, the premium for an 
     insurance plan comparable to my current is increasing from 
     $235 to $407 per month, and my maximum out-of-pocket expense 
     is increasing from $2,700 to $6,350.

  He goes on to complain about hearing the President say on numerous 
occasions, if you like your insurance, you can keep it.

                              {time}  1830

  Here's one from Carmine:

       I am a responsible family man. I've always provided health 
     insurance for my family. In 2008, I was diagnosed with MS, 
     making insurance expensive. However, I always made do by 
     having insurance either on my wife's plan or my own plan. In 
     2009, we lost my wife's plan and we worried because of my 
     preexisting condition. However, we learned that our State of 
     New Jersey had a provision that we cannot be denied coverage 
     as long as we can prove we had coverage at the time I was 
     diagnosed. I also find out that in our State, New Jersey, 
     dependents can stay on their parents' plan up until they are 
     31 years old. So two of Obama's biggest benefits were already 
     available in my State. However, after being extremely 
     responsible in this tough economic time, the ObamaCare law 
     has now made my insurance policy nonrenewable. My wife worked 
     really hard to make sure that I and our child are covered 
     under this plan and now we will lose it. We do not know if 
     these plans, which could be a little cheaper, will provide 
     the coverage I need. I have a specific doctor I see at St. 
     Sinai. Because the liberal Democrats want to cover the 
     uninsured--a noble thing--they are hurting those who always 
     try to be responsible.

  That was Carmine in New Jersey.
  It is worth noting, Mr. Speaker, that back during the ObamaCare 
debate, there were many of us Republicans who were saying to our 
Democratic friends--they controlled the White House; they controlled 
the House; they controlled the Senate--who said, Look, why don't we do 
a bipartisan group of bills or one bill? We can agree on a bill that 
allows people to keep their kids on their insurance if they're 
dependents. We can work something out here. We were told we weren't 
needed because they controlled the White House, the Senate, the House 
of Representatives. They didn't need our input.
  They rammed through a bill without knowing what all was in it. I know 
of cases, I've heard of cases where people had acknowledged conditions, 
insurance companies that we know, and then later got dropped after they 
got expensive. Oh, you had a preexisting condition. There have been 
things that were very unfair that insurance companies have done, and 
there are ways to deal with those things. When there are not, we should 
fix it with legislation.
  What the Democratic party did, without most people who voted for the 
ObamaCare bill knowing what was in it, they passed a law that had not 
been properly vetted or thought through. There was no chance to fuss 
about amendments at the subcommittee, at the committee, or here on the 
floor because the bill that was dealt with in the subcommittee, 
committee, it wasn't the same one that they rushed through as the final 
ObamaCare.
  I read the 1,000-page bill. I read their 2,000-page bill when it 
looked like that was what they were going to vote on here. Then it 
turned out, here came the other. So I was slow to make my way through 
that bill. I really didn't want to. What if they come back with a 
5,000-page bill after that? When it turned out that's what they were 
really going to do, I went through that.
  I wasn't able to go through and take the sections in each place that 
were talked about in other bills, other laws. It's almost impossible 
unless you have a tremendous amount of time to go back and figure out 
how it actually affects other laws. But when you read through it, you 
get an awful lot of gist of what's happening, and it sure wasn't 
something we should have passed.
  Karen, from Vermont, actually, said:

       Shortly following passage of ObamaCare, I lost my primary 
     care doctor. He decided to join a group that limited the 
     number of patients that he could treat, and they charged a 
     yearly fee not covered by Medicare for the privilege of 
     remaining his patient. This resulted in hundreds of patients 
     being dropped. Put an end to ObamaCare.

  She lost her doctor. She didn't get to keep him or her.
  Here's one from Dee:

       My insurance deductible was raised to $4,000, as of 
     September 1, 2013, per individual, $8,000 per family.

  She goes on to describe all the other things that jumped up as a 
result.
  Here's one from Erica:

       As a single disabled mom to one disabled son, I'm on 
     Medicare and Medicaid. I just got my new policy for 2014. 
     Half of the insurance I had is gone because of----

  Well, I can't read that here, Mr. Speaker, as Erica describes the 
bill in such a way that I can't read it on the floor.
  Anyway, she says:

       I was able to join a gym on a discount to keep me active, 
     but no longer can do that. My price increased for my 
     prescription drugs. Please, repeal this bill and listen to 
     the American people.

  Here's one from Helen:

       As a glass artist, Obama's hold on our economy has ruined 
     my business. My target market is middle class, stay-at-home 
     moms, but almost all my customer base has shifted to those 
     owning half-million-dollar homes. I know, because I check 
     every time I make a sale. This makes me very sad, and even 
     mad, that only the wealthy can afford my art now. I should 
     have gone into gun sales, which don't discriminate.
       ObamaCare has forced my family to lose our Blue Cross from 
     my husband's work because he cannot afford us anymore. We're 
     almost old enough to go on Medicare, but I hear it's been 
     raided by ObamaCare, which we refuse to participate in. We're 
     not Obama's slaves.

  Well, I'm not going to read the rest of that. But Helen obviously is 
rather bitter because they liked their insurance, but the promises were 
broken. She didn't keep her insurance, she and her family. That's only 
a portion of the stacks of emails we've been getting.
  I want to go back to the question my friends ask: Why not just let 
ObamaCare go through? Like I say, if you're a pure political animal, 
yeah, let it go through. Let Americans like

[[Page H6221]]

these poor folks, let them keep suffering and, ooh, it will be so good. 
Republicans will win back the majority in the Senate, and we're told, 
oh, gee, they'll win the White House in 2016. Well, it just happens 
that, to some of us, doing the right thing in Congress is not about 
helping a political party. It's about trying to help the people that 
elected us. It's about trying to do what's right for the whole country.
  If your heart doesn't break when you read these stories and when you 
take the phone calls and when you have people tell you, with broken 
hearts, of what's happened to their business, what's happened to their 
job, what's happened to their family, what's happened to their kids' 
jobs and the suffering that's going on, why? if you're enough of a 
political animal like some folks, I guess, yeah, okay, maybe it would 
be great for the Republican Party if we just sat back and let it go 
through, let it devastate everybody you can.
  My late mother used to tell me she wished I would be a doctor. She 
used to have Dr. McKellar, who passed away this year. I think he's the 
one that kept encouraging me, but he would tell me: Louis, you'd be a 
great doctor. I'll help you. You'd be great. We can get you into Baylor 
Medical School.
  That's a great medical school, but it just didn't feel like what I 
was called to do. It didn't feel right in my heart. But when I think 
about the suffering that is going on, I know that I'm in a place to 
make a difference, and we, every one of us here in this body, are here 
where we can make a difference, where we can help people see the doctor 
that they should see.

  The question has come from different constituents, from other people, 
gee, all Federal workers--some think that Congress has a different 
health care plan than all Federal workers, but it's all part of the 
same Federal plan that every Federal worker has, and you've got choices 
you can make. Some people have asked a question that I don't have a 
really good answer for. They've said: If the Democrats were so 
insistent, if the real purpose of ObamaCare was to try to make sure 
people that didn't have insurance got insurance, and they really 
intended to make sure that if you like your insurance you can keep your 
insurance, and if they were really serious that if you like your doctor 
you can keep your doctor, then why didn't they just figure out a way 
that if you don't have insurance, you can choose from a State's 
cafeteria plan or Federal employee plan in their States? Do something 
like that.
  I don't have a good answer, other than, when you look and you go 
through ObamaCare, it is very clear, as we said before, it wasn't just 
about health care. It was about the GRE, the government running 
everything, the government getting all of your most personal, private 
information, having every one of your medical records in Federal 
possession.
  It's a disaster.
  Well, I have reflected on Franklin Roosevelt's speech. I admired the 
speech he gave in this room from that podium when it was white marble, 
that this is a day that will live in infamy. He gave another speech 
when he said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. It's 
considered one of the greatest speeches by anybody. Yet our President 
was on CNBC yesterday, and he said:

       If we get into the habit where one party is allowed to 
     extort, then any President who comes after me would be unable 
     to govern effectively.

  That's rather interesting. It's a little different from the approach 
that Bill Clinton took back in the 1990s; because President Clinton, 
back during the shutdown, the few weeks that was going on, talked to 
the Speaker of the House virtually every day. There may have been 1 or 
2 days that they didn't talk, but otherwise, they were basically 
talking every day.
  You had an interviewer asking the President, gee, Wall Street seems 
to be pretty calm. The President, instead of saying that's a great 
thing, everybody should remain calm, we're going to work this thing 
out, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, instead sounded 
more like a fire alarm, gee, they better be concerned.
  He wanted Wall Street to be concerned, to be worried, because when 
Wall Street gets worried, then it means that people that have invested 
in the market, that have their life savings, retirement savings in the 
market, it means they lose money. Yet that's what was suggested--get 
worried, get concerned.

                              {time}  1845

  Here's an article from Penny Starr from yesterday afternoon late. It 
is an interview with our Democratic colleague across the aisle who 
chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee that brought ObamaCare to the 
floor. cnsnews.com asked, ``What I was going to ask you is if you've 
read those 10,535 pages of regulations.'' Those are the final ObamaCare 
regulations that have now come out and been published in the Federal 
Register.
  Former Chairman Waxman, who pushed through the ObamaCare bill, said 
to the reporter, ``Have you read them?'' The reporter said, ``No. Have 
you read them?'' The former chairman that pushed through ObamaCare 
said, ``Is it important that I read it?'' The reporter said, ``Do you 
think that the American people should read it? I just asked you a very 
honest question, whether you've read them. It's a yes or no question.'' 
The former chairman that shoved through ObamaCare said, ``I think i.."

                  A NEW DAY FOR HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, the prior speaker's prayers are about to be 
answered.
  Mr. Speaker, my State of Kentucky is a national model for how the 
Affordable Care Act can make our constituents' lives more secure and 
their businesses stronger. I would like to share one story. Will 
Russell is the owner of Why Louisville, a small independent business in 
my district that specializes in locally designed clothing and art. The 
father of a 1-year-old, he also has a preexisting condition that led 
insurance companies to deny him coverage for the past 15 years.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, beginning January 1, Will and his 
wife and son will be covered under a plan they found on Kynect, 
Kentucky's health insurance exchange. Will estimates his family will 
save $300 a month. Add that to the peace of mind that comes with 
knowing he will never face medical bankruptcy and the threat of losing 
his thriving business just because he didn't have access to insurance.
  He has been so pleased with the ease and affordability of Kynect that 
he is now exploring coverage for his employees for the first time 
through the State's small business exchange. Mr. Speaker, Will's story 
is one among millions of Americans who are finding expanded care 
through the Affordable Care Act. To quote Will:

       It's going to be a new day for my family, for me, and so 
     many people just like us in Kentucky and throughout the 
     country.

                 THE BUDGET AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Schweikert). Under the Speaker's 
announced policy of January 5, 2011, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority 
leader.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today we have seen a remarkable event 
here on floor of the House. During this discussion that's so critically 
important to this Nation about the deficit and how we are going to deal 
with our budget, this House passed a bill that will actually increase 
the deficit, a bill passed today with the support of the Republicans to 
repeal a provision in the Affordable Health Care Act that will keep 
Americans healthy.
  Healthy Americans don't need medical care, and I suppose the idea of 
the Republicans here is that they ought to get sick. You take a look at 
the wellness issue, part of the Affordable Care Act, it provided for 
numerous activities specifically designed to keep Americans healthy: 
blood pressure screening for adults, programs for children to avoid 
obesity, public health programs for vaccination so that our children 
and, indeed, our adults don't get sick. All of these programs in the 
wellness portion of the Affordable Care Act would be repealed by the 
action that the Republicans just voted on not more than a half-hour 
ago.
  What in the world is going on here? What's this all about? Is it some 
sort of ideological spiritual thing to do what is not very smart?
  The Affordable Health Care Act, which they like to call ObamaCare, 
has many, many provisions in it specifically designed to reduce the 
cost of

[[Page H2649]]

medical care in America. If you are going to deal with the deficit, and 
we all talk about it here, you have got to deal with the cost of 
Medicare.
  How do you deal with the cost of Medicare? Well, you deal with it by 
reducing the likelihood that seniors will get sick. You deal with it by 
reducing high blood pressure in seniors so they don't have strokes. One 
of the most expensive things that the senior population will endure is 
a stroke. It's not just the immediate medical care; it's the long-term 
effect of a stroke. So when we go out and we try to have seniors and 
those soon to be seniors have blood pressure checks, we reduce the cost 
of medical care in America. But I guess the Republicans don't see it 
that way.
  They also see it in another way, and that is somehow they believe 
that we can reduce the cost of medical care in the Federal budget by 
terminating Medicare. It is unbelievable that the Republican budget 
would terminate medical care for seniors by terminating Medicare, a 
program that was started in 1964 to deal with the specific problem that 
seniors had at that period, and that was the inability to afford 
medical services. They would literally be into bankruptcy and poverty 
because they couldn't pay for their medical care.
  So, in 1964, Lyndon Baines Johnson and the Democrats in this House 
and the Senate passed Medicare, one of the foundations of support for 
the senior population in this Nation. And yet in the Republican budget 
that will be on this floor later this week is the repeal of Medicare, 
the termination of it.
  So I suppose this is the new way we ought to look at this issue. It's 
a tombstone. And what it is, it said, Medicare, 1965 to 2011, created 
by LBJ, destroyed by the GOP. Unbelievable.
  Fortunately, today, when President Obama spoke to the Nation, he 
addressed this issue, and I will paraphrase what he said. He says it 
more as a professor. I guess I will just say it as a street fighter 
from California: No way, no how will, in his Presidency, Medicare be 
terminated.
  Are you listening my friends on the Republican side? The President 
said ``no.'' We are not going down the path of terminating Medicare.
  And I know that my caucus, the Democratic Caucus, will stand there 
with the President. We will fight any attempt any time, anyplace, 
anywhere that you or anybody else will put before this House a proposal 
to terminate Medicare. We will not allow it, and thankfully the 
President has the veto pen. He ought to go back and pull out the pen 
that LBJ used to sign the Medicare law in 1965 and put it to paper 
should, somehow, the Republican budget arrive on his desk with the 
termination of Medicare in it. It should not happen. It cannot happen. 
We cannot subject our seniors to the kind of poverty that existed prior 
to the implementation of Medicare in the 1960s. This is something that 
we will stand and fight on.
  The President had also said today, as he laid out his solution for a 
$4 trillion reduction in the deficit, do not terminate Medicare and 
don't privatize Social Security. Laying it down. Not a line in the 
sand, but clearly a mark on the concrete. Social Security will not be 
privatized during his watch.
  Thank you, Mr. President. And you know this, that the Democratic 
Caucus in this House will stand firmly with you, and we will fight 
every, every bill, every proposal to privatize Social Security.
  Now, we know there is a budget problem. We know that there is a 
deficit problem here in the United States, and we know that it has to 
be addressed. The President has laid out two chapters in the Democratic 
proposal to deal with the deficit.
  In his State of the Union speech, he made it clear that Federal 
expenditures needed to be frozen over the next 5 years, and today he 
took another step recommending specific reductions in various Federal 
programs, all to the good, and we will stand there with him and we will 
work on reducing those Federal expenditures.
  For me, I have got one in mind, about $120 billion a year that we 
could save, $120 billion a year. Now, that's four times, three and a 
half times what is in the Republican continuing resolution that will be 
on floor this week.
  How do you find $120 billion a year? End the war in Afghanistan. End 
the war in Afghanistan. Bring the troops home. Bring the money home. 
Balance our budget. Use that to solve the deficit, or spend that money 
on building those roads, those facilities here in the United States.

                              {time}  1800

  Let's talk about the deficit for a moment. Oh, yes. If you're going 
to talk about the deficit, you really ought to understand where the 
deficit came from. It didn't just come out of the blue this year. It 
didn't just appear during the Obama administration. The deficit is 
something that has built up over a long period of time here in the 
United States. When they say the deficit is $14 trillion and is going 
to increase, well, it's not if the President and the Democrats get 
their way. It will actually be reduced by $4 trillion.
  However, as to the current deficit, where did it come from? From 
where did it magically appear? Who left us with huge deficits?
  Let's take a look. Here are the facts.
  This fellow over here, you may recognize him. He is Ronald Reagan. At 
the end of every year, the Congressional Budget Office makes an 
estimate of what is going to happen over the next 10 years. At the end 
of the Ronald Reagan period, his last year in office, the Congressional 
Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, made an 
estimate of the Federal budget situation. Where's the deficit? They 
estimated that, in the next 10 years, Ronald Reagan's budget and the 
programs that were put into effect during his period would create a 
$1.4 trillion deficit.
  Now, those of you who are familiar with the history of the United 
States would know that George H. W. Bush--the senior--followed Ronald 
Reagan. At the end of his 4 years in office, again, the Congressional 
Budget Office made an estimate. It estimated, should the Bush-Reagan 
policies go forward, the deficit would be $3.3 trillion in the out 
years.
  Then along came Bill Clinton. In the first 4 years of his 
administration, Bill Clinton put in place, if extended forward, 
policies that would deal with the deficit, such things as PAYGO--a word 
that's common in Washington, but I'm sure, out there in the great 
American public, people have no idea what ``PAYGO'' is. ``PAYGO'' was 
the law during the Clinton administration. It required that any bill 
passed by Congress had to be paid for with either higher taxes or cuts 
in some other program. In other words, it could not create a deficit. 
It could not add to the deficit.
  There were other programs put in place, part of which I was 
responsible for implementing, and that was the reinventing of 
government. I was the Deputy Secretary at the Department of the 
Interior during those years, and we were told by the Clinton 
administration's Office of Management and Budget that you will reduce 
the expenditures of the Department of the Interior, and you will 
continue to do the same things. Only, you will do them better. 
Effective and efficient government. We reduced the number of employees 
in the Department of the Interior during those first 4\1/2\ to 5 years 
by some 15,000 people--from 90,000 to 75,000 people. We performed all 
of the previous services as well and, in many cases, better. So it is 
possible to be efficient and effective in this process.
  Anyway, Bill Clinton is now President, and he puts all of these 
policies in place. At the end of his Presidency, the Congressional 
Budget Office did what it always does, which is to produce an estimate 
of what would happen in the next 10 years if the same policies were to 
continue. Guess what would happen. What would happen is a $5.6 trillion 
surplus, enough to wipe out all of the American debt--no debt, no 
interest payments, everything paid off.
  However, Bill Clinton was followed by George W. Bush, and 
immediately, in the very first year of the Bush administration, the 
Clinton-period policies, some of which were voted on by Republicans as 
well as Democrats, were terminated. Massive tax cuts were put in place 
not only in year one but in year two. Two wars were started--the 
Afghanistan war and the Iraq war--neither of which were paid for. It 
was the first time in American history that wars were not paid for but 
were, rather, borrowed. Who did we borrow the

[[Page H2650]]

money from? China. From other foreign countries? Yes.
  Anyway, you now had two massive tax cuts, two wars, and then the 
Medicare drug program, which was about $700 billion a year--not paid 
for but, rather, borrowed, not for 1 year but for every year on into 
the future.
  Thirdly, there was a whole set of policies where the government 
simply stepped back and let Wall Street do whatever it wanted to do. 
What it wanted to do was to engage in reckless profiteering, resulting 
in 2007 and 2008 with the crash of the American economy, with the Wall 
Street crash of 2008, bringing the American economy to its knees, to 
the greatest recession since the Great Depression. Those policies added 
up to this rather massive red zone here of $11.5 trillion of deficit, 
estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office, which projected in the next 10 years, if 
the same policies continued, an $11.5 trillion deficit.
  President Obama came into office in January of 2009. The day he 
arrived in office, the budget had a $1.3 trillion hole in it. He didn't 
create it, but he had to deal with it--a $1.3 trillion deficit handed 
to him by George W. Bush and his policies.
  That's the history. Now we're trying to dig ourselves out of that 
hole. Properly said, when you're in a hole, stop digging. A wise 
policy. The President couldn't do that, and this Congress couldn't do 
that in the face of the most serious financial and economic crisis this 
Nation had faced since the Great Depression. So the stimulus bill was 
enacted, some $750 billion, and it worked. Despite all the rhetoric, 
the economists looking at that today, in the cool memory of the 
stimulus bill, said it worked; it saved this economy; it saved this 
Nation.
  Every other industrialized country in the world did the exact same 
thing--stimulated their economies. Together, the American and the 
international economies were stabilized, and we began to slowly grow 
out of that great recession. We're not out of it yet. We've got to put 
in place policies that end the deficit, and that's precisely what the 
President talked about today.
  The Republicans have put a proposal before us, and we'll vote on it 
this week, but it is not a proposal that will help America retain its 
eminence as the most dynamic, the most creative, the most innovative, 
and the most successful economy in the world, because of the policies 
that are in it. It will terminate Medicare, and it will significantly 
reduce those programs that create future economic growth.
  I would like to just take a deep breath now and turn it over to my 
colleague from the great northeastern part of the United States.
  Peter, would you join us and carry on this discussion.
  Mr. WELCH. Yes, thank you. I appreciate your historical perspective 
on it.
  There are really two things that I want to address. Number one: What 
are the policies that were part of getting us to that $11.5 trillion 
deficit? Number two: What do we need to do now in order to get to 
fiscal balance?
  The two policies were, one, a war of choice where the Pentagon in its 
activities was not subject to the same scrutiny of actually having to 
pay as you go, so the cost of the war in Iraq was $1 trillion. The war 
in Afghanistan, as you mentioned, started out as a mission to dislodge 
Osama bin Laden. It was transformed into nation-building.

                              {time}  1810

  And no matter how necessary or debatable either of those events were, 
those wars were, you do have to pay for it. It's not as though because 
it's in the name of national security it can be exempt from fiscal 
responsibility. In fact, what's unusual is that this is the first time 
in the history of our country where we have been at war where we 
actually haven't asked for shared sacrifice by the taxpayers, but we've 
made the entire burden be borne by our military. So we've got to pay; 
and we didn't do it, as you pointed out.
  The second is the theory that's being advanced by many that if you 
cut taxes, it will create wealth and create jobs. In some places and 
some times and in some circumstances that will work. In fact, many 
standard economists say that in a recession, it's the time to cut 
taxes, not raise them. But the more that is focused on the middle class 
who are struggling--especially in a down economic time--to pay their 
bills, if they get a tax cut, they have discretionary income or they 
have income liberated, that money is going to go right back into the 
economy. But every tax cut does not generate jobs, and many tax cuts 
end up adding significantly to the deficit.
  The President Bush tax cut in 2001 and the President Bush tax cut in 
2003 added $2.3 billion to the deficit. So you have a Pentagon that is 
not subject to pay-as-you-go and you have tax cuts that don't pay for 
themselves. Those are two major contributing factors to that $11.5 
trillion deficit on the heels of a $5.6 trillion surplus. The debate we 
are having now in this House is enormously consequential to the future. 
Republicans won this last election, and a major argument they made is 
that we've got to get spending under control. They're right. I agree 
with that. We have to get to fiscal balance.
  The challenge is if we're going to get there, do we need a plan that 
repeats those two policies of the Bush administration, namely, keeping 
the Pentagon off the table and increasing tax cuts, particularly to the 
high end, but keeping off the table Pentagon savings, keeping off the 
table eliminating tax loopholes and keeping off the table the question 
of revenues?
  Democrats, in my view, have to be willing to come forward and say, 
look, the programs that we have been strong supporters of have to be 
re-examined, we have to reform them, we have to make them more 
efficient; and if they are not working, we have to acknowledge that and 
move on. We have to do our share. The President's proposal that would 
freeze domestic spending for 5 years is pretty dramatic, but many 
Democrats would be willing to support tough medicine as long as the 
plan had on the table other things that are major contributors to the 
fiscal situation we're in. That's, of course, revenues; that's, of 
course, the Pentagon; and that's, of course, tax loopholes in the tax 
system.
  We can get from where we are to where we need to be. We saw that in 
recent years when it happened under President Clinton. Again, as you 
pointed out, in those years, Tax Codes matter; but in the Clinton years 
when we had higher tax rates, we created 20 million jobs. In the Bush 
years when we had lower tax rates, we created 600,000 jobs. And also 
incomes were increasing.
  So this has to be reviewed by this body, in my view, as a practical 
problem for us to solve, not an ideological argument that every tax cut 
is going to be beneficial anymore than every spending program is going 
to be beneficial. You have to apply judgment to the situation at hand. 
The big challenge for us is restoring the fiscal balance.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Let me thank my colleague from Vermont, Peter Welch, 
for this presentation on the tax policy. I think we probably would want 
to stay with that a few moments. I know my colleague from New York (Mr. 
Tonko) is here, and perhaps you would like to opine and to share with 
us your thoughts on these issues of the budget and how we can deal with 
the deficit.
  Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative Garamendi. And I compliment 
Representative Welch for what I believe is a balanced approach to how 
to solve the deficit situation, the debt situation, and certainly how 
do we move forward with a sound budget that can invest in America at a 
time when other nations are investing in a clean-energy, innovation 
economy. We don't have the luxury to just hone in on deficit, or budget 
carving here that solely relies on impacts through domestic program 
cuts on our middle class families, our working families and the poor.
  What we have seen here is trillions' worth of cuts to domestic 
programs, impacting the ability to pay utility bills, impacting the 
ability to perhaps send your adult child off to college, to dream the 
American Dream, to own a home and to have an affordable home budget. 
All of these items are at risk here. We're putting people most 
vulnerable at risk. We have seen almost a flat curve for the growth in 
household income across America, just a slight bump upward, while we've 
seen an exponential rise in corporate executive salaries, in 
millionaire and billionaire wealth. That's where the growth has been.

[[Page H2651]]

  The recovery here has seen that happening with a downward spiral, a 
downward mobile quality to the comeback of our efforts here in this 
country. So it is important for us to make certain that there is a 
balance here, that we're calling upon all tools in the toolkit to make 
it all happen.
  And this chart absolutely tells a story. Over the last 40 years, 
middle class wages have stagnated while millionaires and billionaires 
have trumped all by 256 percent.
  Now, this tells a story. When people are talking about not wanting to 
visit a fairness in tax policy here, when we have seen the anger in 
America expressed via the many, many households that the great 
multitudes of people in this country are portrayed in the middle class, 
they are the population that have expressed anger, and rightfully so, 
that anger has got to be addressed through fairness in tax policy, 
through an across-the-board impact of solution here that will enable us 
to do what's fair and do what's correct.
  I watch the savings that they talk about here with the Republican 
plan. The Republicans will talk about the huge amounts of savings that 
they produce all through cuts on the domestic programs, again impacting 
working families, the poor and the middle class. Well, those aren't 
savings because in order to be savings, they might be in a locked box 
or assumed to go after relieving the deficit. But instead, they take 
these trillions in like amounts and provide tax cuts for millionaires, 
billionaires and corporations and still continue to hand out mindlessly 
the subsidies to big oil companies. This is what is so most egregious 
about this budget.
  Instead of working towards a balance that looks at revenues, that 
looks at the domestic programs that require investment, no, they are 
going pell-mell into an all-out attack on the middle class. That's 
wrong. And also in the outcome as they slide programs, assistance and 
investments to middle class America, as they slide it over to the 
millionaire, billionaire, corporate and big oil companies crowd, that 
community, what happens in the interim? With this Republican plan for a 
budget, we grow debt by $8 trillion.
  So where have we gained here? This sounds like a repeat of the pre-
recession years where we were not acknowledging fairness in revenues, 
where we were allowing for a falling apart of the system. At the same 
time we took the watchdog out of the equation on the financial sector 
on Wall Street. We allowed for working families' portfolios of 
investments to go to ruination where we lost $2.8 trillion in 
accumulated wealth on 401(k)s and various other investment materials. 
And this is what happened: we destroyed the economy, and now we're 
going to repeat history, history of the worst kind.
  Let's pick up on the history of the best kind. Let's pick up on 
investing in jobs as we did in the FDR years where we came out of tough 
economic times and people knew the dignity of work and we saw projects 
built across America, not the trickle-down theory that didn't work 
during the Reagan administration and the trickle-down theory that 
didn't work during the second Bush Presidency. It just didn't happen.
  And my question is, I can't help but rhetorically ask, why would we 
revisit that kind of scenario again knowing that we're just crawling 
out of the recession and we're growing private sector jobs to the tune 
of $2 million in just over a year? Why would we disrupt that progress? 
I ask, why would we disrupt that?
  Representative Garamendi, I think it is great that we're bringing 
this information to the forefront here and allowing it to be exchanged 
with the people that we serve day in and day out who have expressed, 
rightfully, the anger about the onus, the burden and the unnecessary 
pain that has been placed upon households of modest annual income 
means.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. The chart that you and I shared a moment ago is up 
here next to me; and it clearly shows that we have seen a middle class 
in America that has seen very, very little progress over the last two 
decades and, instead, an enormous shift of wealth and income to the top 
1 or 2 percent of the Nation.

                              {time}  1820

  There has been a 256 percent increase in income to the very wealthy, 
and as I said, it trumps all of the income gains by the rest of the 
economy. Those at the bottom saw maybe a 10 to 11 percent increase. The 
rest, very, very little.
  I look up and I see my colleague, the gentleman from the great State 
of Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). Thank you for joining us. We talked earlier 
today about the upcoming debt limit. Please join with us and share with 
us your thoughts on what we are doing here, what we shouldn't be doing, 
or should be doing.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your leadership and your focusing on the 
issues that face us.
  Having spent hours in the Budget Committee so far this Congress, I 
must admit that I was shocked and surprised with the profoundly 
negative approach that is being taken by my good friend, Paul Ryan, the 
chair of the Budget Committee and my Republican friends.
  First of all, there is in essence a refusal to zero in on the three 
areas of greatest increase in the budget. We see repeated charts that 
talk about Medicare going through the roof over the next 50 years. And 
it is true. We need to get Medicare spending under control because the 
past path is not sustainable. But ironically what is ignored is that 
the approach that is being offered by the Republicans in their budget 
actually ignores the major provisions that have been placed in statute 
now that would actually reduce the rate of Medicare spending in the 
future.
  We have taken every significant, independently verified promising 
initiative to bend that cost curve, and they have been stripped away. 
We watched Republicans attack Democrats because there were provisions 
to be able to make a difference with Medicare spending, claiming it 
would somehow slash Medicare for senior citizens by a half-trillion 
dollars. Well, Congressman Garamendi, you and I come from areas of the 
country that actually have been able to reduce health care costs, they 
are below the national average, and in both areas we actually have 
higher performance; better health care, less cost. If the rest of 
America practiced medicine the way it is practiced in our two 
communities, there would not be a Medicare crisis.
  What we have done with the reform act was embed those notions to be 
able to provide incentives to reward value over volume, not just pay 
for procedures. To be able to have accountable care organizations, 
bundling of services, to actually have some financial disincentives for 
unnecessary hospital readmissions. All of these, the experts tell us, 
could save over $1.2 trillion over the next 20 years. And, in fact, if 
we had the courage to actually improve and accelerate and enhance, 
there are greater savings because the doctors, the nurses, the 
hospitals in our two communities have proven that it is possible. But 
our Republican friends have simply decided to turn their back on that. 
They are going to take the Medicare savings and spend it for tax cuts 
for people who need it the least.
  I can't help but turn back to you because you have an interesting 
chart there on the floor that may say it all.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank you, and let's just do a colloquy here back 
and forth. You've talked about ways in which we can bend the cost curve 
for health care for all Americans, not only those on Medicare. It was 
in the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform. Our Republican 
friends like to call it ObamaCare because it actually would reduce the 
cost of medical services for everybody, whether you are in Medicare or 
Kaiser or anywhere else. And you mentioned four very, very important 
ways it does it. One is hospital readmissions, otherwise known as 
hospital infections. Our former colleague a week ago likely died of a 
hospital infection. The Affordable Care Act places a heavy burden on 
hospitals that have a high infection rate, or readmissions. It is a 
very, very expensive, deadly situation. It is just one of several ways 
in which the Affordable Care Act reduced over time the cost of medical 
services.
  You were here on the floor. I voted ``no,'' you voted ``no'' on a 
bill that Republicans forced through this House that eliminates 
wellness. What in the world was that all about? Why would you ever 
eliminate wellness: obesity, blood pressure, proper eating, nutrition, 
public health, vaccinations--all of these things to keep people 
healthy. Healthy people don't cost money. They

[[Page H2652]]

don't run up the price of medical services. So they want to repeal 
that, and I'm going, that makes no sense at all. You are actually 
increasing the deficit by doing that. And then they take it to the 
ultimate step of terminating Medicare.
  This has become my favorite. It's the tombstone for Medicare. In the 
Republican budget is a proposal that would terminate Medicare for all 
Americans who are less than 55 years of age today. If you are 65, maybe 
it would continue on. But if you look at the totality of their 
proposal, it is the termination of Medicare and this is what we have. 
``Medicare, 1965 to 2011, created by LBJ, destroyed by the GOP.'' 
Unbelievable. And along with it, a significant reduction in Medicaid, 
which in California we call Medi-Cal.
  Your expertise, Mr. Blumenauer, on the health care issue and the 
experience in Oregon on how we can reduce the cost of medical care 
needs to be heard by every Member of this House. So if you would 
continue on and share with us this issue of medical services and how we 
can reduce the cost, save Medicare, and simultaneously addressing the 
deficit.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Your point is well taken in terms of what they would 
do terminating Medicare as we know it for everybody under 55 years of 
age. We are talking about over 230 million Americans. And as a result 
of this, it is clear, you can look at the Congressional Budget Office, 
other independent experts, it is not going to reduce the cost of health 
care. In fact, it is going to increase the cost of health care in 
America. But what it does is it is going to put an ever-increasing 
burden on elderly Americans. It is going to have a gap because 
ultimately they are not going to enable people to have Medicare until 
they are 67. They are going to have a small voucher that is given to 
the insurance company. Bear in mind the reason that LBJ and the 
Democratic Congress in 1965 enacted Medicare was because America's 
elderly could not get good insurance coverage that was comprehensive 
and affordable. Senior citizens, like it or not, are older. They are 
frailer. They are less healthy than younger Americans, and they are not 
working as much. They don't have the income. They need help. Now, our 
Republican friends would lead us to believe that all of a sudden there 
will be a private insurance market, which by the way sounds 
suspiciously like the exchanges that they said were bad in the health 
reform act, and they would force people into them, but they would have 
decreasing premium support.

                              {time}  1830

  I think it is also appropriate to just reflect for a moment about 
what happens to the 78 million geezer baby boomers who are 55 or older 
who will be under Medicare. That's going to continue for years. It's 
going to be increasingly inefficient. It appears as though there are 
some extra costs that are embedded for existing and soon-to-be future 
Medicare recipients that are going to continue to distort, drive up 
costs, and, of course, nationally we're all going to pay more for the 
privilege.
  I would suggest this tombstone is something that people should 
consider carefully, because it's going to mean, I sincerely believe, 
not just the death of Medicare but it is going to provide profound 
shifts and dislocations within our health care system, hurt the 
providers, and provide less effective health care for our elderly 
citizens.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Let me add to that and carry on a little piece of it.
  The Republican budget, which we will be voting on here on the floor 
of Congress in the next 2 days, has provisions that are equally harmful 
to seniors and to wannabe seniors, people who want to get to be 65 or 
67 years of age, and these are the Medicaid reductions.
  In the proposal that the Republicans will bring to this floor, the 
Road to Ruin proposal, is a block grant to the States for Medicaid 
services. In California, we call it Medi-Cal. This is a program that 
provides benefits to the poor and those who cannot afford medical 
services because they are severely disabled, mentally disabled, or 
seniors that cannot afford services in nursing homes. The block grant 
is less than what is now available to nearly every State, and it is 
scheduled to be reduced in the years ahead, the purpose of which is 
presumably to d.."

                    MMM, MMM BAD HEALTH CARE POLICY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Crowley) for 2 minutes.
  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, today, Republicans in the House will once 
again bring up a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
  We've seen a lot of repeal from them, but not as much with respect to 
their so-called plan to replace. I think I've figured out what the GOP 
wants to replace the Affordable Care Act with.
  Here is what I assume must be the Republican plan for health care in 
our country: chicken noodle soup. Chicken noodle soup? Many of our 
mothers and grandmothers have told us that chicken noodle soup is a 
cure-all for anything, but I think the Republican plan takes Grandma at 
her word a little too literally.
  Can't afford health care coverage and need medical care? Have some 
chicken noodle soup. Have you been diagnosed with a serious disease and 
can't afford the prescription drugs you need to treat it? Have some 
chicken noodle soup. At least you can rely on good old-fashioned 
chicken noodle soup. Have a preexisting condition like diabetes that 
lets your insurance company deny you coverage? That's okay. Have some 
chicken noodle soup and you'll feel better in the morning.
  The truth is, it won't be all better in the morning. That's why we 
enacted the Affordable Care Act, to ensure that people could get the 
affordable, quality coverage they need; that seniors can afford their 
prescription medications; and that an insurance company can no longer 
deny you coverage because you have a preexisting condition.
  I don't know why Republicans want to go back to the day when chicken 
noodle soup was the only option for hardworking families who couldn't 
afford care. The truth is, chicken noodle soup might be mmm, mmm good 
for lunch, but as a health care policy, it is mmm, mmm bad.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to share some remarks about the 
comments. I want to say Senator Boxer is a great advocate and does a 
good job as chair of our Committee on the Environment and Public Works. 
Pretty much we have had unanimous votes on bills that came out, 
Republicans and Democrats voting unanimously on the bills that came 
out. Sometimes we have differences and we fight over them, but a lot of 
times things are getting done around here.
  But I will just say it is not actually fully correct to say the 
Republicans opposed the President's health care bill, the Affordable 
Care Act, ObamaCare. The American people opposed it by huge numbers. 
They, through an election, a remarkable election, and in some very 
close wins, found themselves with 60 votes in the Senate of the United 
States. They had a majority in the House, and they decided to move this 
bill. They shut out Republicans, moved a partisan bill, and they got it 
through--even when Scott Brown, if you remember, was running for the 
Senate in Massachusetts to fill the late Senator Kennedy's seat. He 
promised he would be the vote that would deny the 60 votes and stop 
this bill, and he won in Massachusetts. But he couldn't get here 
quickly enough. They were able to get the bill passed before he got 
here to kill it.
  This has never been a popular bill and the polling number shows it is 
even less popular today than it was when they rammed it through. So 
this is not a little bitty matter. It threatens our Republic, I think, 
in a lot of different ways. I have talked about that earlier. But I 
would say--to understand the dynamics on the floor of the Senate--you 
have to understand that the majority leader, having gotten his bill 
passed on Christmas Eve 2009, after all kinds of maneuvers to get that 
accomplished, has protected it from any further debate and discussion. 
He has blocked any ability to bring up the legislation and to be able 
to amend it and fix some of the obvious flaws in it. One of the top 
drafters, the Senate Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee, has 
called it a train wreck, and it at least at needs reform. It really 
cannot succeed in its present form. Senator Reid has blocked any effort 
to bring up a bill and fix it. The American people might find that hard 
to believe, but I will repeat it: Since that time there have been 
numerous efforts on behalf of Members from this side to call up 
amendments and call up legislation to alter, amend, and replace the 
ObamaCare legislation.

  He has utilized parliamentarian maneuvers, filling the tree, to block 
that. It cannot continue. This is about to become a law. It is going to 
hammer the American economy. It is already hammering the economy. The 
American people don't want it, and we are not going to go silent. So 
this is the beginning of the fight.
  Senator Cruz--maybe people can disagree with his tactics--but he 
drove and raised the issue. We need to keep talking about it; we just 
do. It is time for this Congress to listen to the voice of the American 
people.
  Senator Boxer is a good person, and she said President Bush had $1 
trillion deficits and President Obama has reduced them in half. The 
highest deficit President Bush ever had in the 8 years he served as 
President was $487 billion, which is a lot of money--too much. The year 
before, it was $168 billion.
  When President Obama took office, what was the first thing that was 
passed within weeks? A $1 trillion stimulus bill to supposedly 
stimulate the economy, but the money went out to government agencies 
and departments, and it had no stimulus impact at all. It was $1 
trillion--every penny of which was borrowed. That year the deficit went 
up well over $1 trillion. The next year it was well over $1 trillion, 
the next year well over $1 trillion, and the next year well over $1 
trillion.
  In the first 4 years of President Obama's leadership, we had the 
highest deficits ever recorded in America. It is a stunning event, and 
he fought every day--and there were fights on the floor--to spend more 
and borrow more.
  Some of his advisers would say: The reason this economy isn't growing 
so well is because we didn't borrow and spend enough. We didn't have 
enough. We should have created more debt and should have spent more. It 
has resulted to this date in the lowest rebound economically from a 
recession since World War II, and we are not doing well in that regard.
  It is absolutely not so that President Obama bears no responsibility 
for the unprecedented debt that he has run up during this time. He is 
still advocating for $1 trillion more in spending above the Budget 
Control Act levels that he agreed to in the summer of 2011. He wants to 
spend $1 trillion more than what he signed as an agreement to raise the 
debt ceiling.
  I know he didn't want to, but Congress said: We are going to cut back 
on your credit card. Now we are going to raise the debt ceiling $2 
trillion, as you said you need, but we demand that you reduce the 
growth of spending over 10 years by $2 trillion.
  We were projected to have spending growth to $10 trillion over the 
current rate of spending, which is about $3.6 trillion a year. We were 
going to increase it by a total of $10 trillion. Under BCA, if we 
adhere to it, we would increase it by $8 trillion, not $10 trillion. 
That is not going to bankrupt America. There is no reason we can't run 
this government by growing the spending by $8 trillion instead of $10 
trillion. So it is unbelievable that we make that point.
  I know the budget balanced in the last years of the 1990s, and 
President Clinton proudly claims credit for that, and he was a part of 
it. But I haven't forgotten that the Republican House was in a constant 
battle over Democratic President Clinton's spending levels, and there 
was actually a fairly long shutdown of the government to contain the 
growth of spending, and it resulted in a balanced budget. That is how 
it happened. There was credit enough to go to both sides of that.
  We need health care reform. It needs to be smartly and effectively 
done. We can improve health care in our country, but it does not have 
to tank the American economy, and that is what has been happening in 
recent days. I was going to talk about that, without much reference to 
ObamaCare and the health care bill--which is a negative factor of 
economic growth of very large proportions--but I just followed my 
friend and able colleague, Senator Boxer, and I wanted to share those 
points.
  Last Thursday I delivered the first in a series of speeches looking 
at the state of our economy. I directed my staff on the Budget 
Committee--I am the ranking Republican there--to specifically analyze 
conditions facing working Americans so I could share those findings 
directly with the Members of the Senate. Both parties need to focus 
their efforts on defending working Americans from policies--Washington 
policies too often--that damage their financial well-being. It is 
happening. Last week I discussed the falling incomes and social 
challenges eroding the security of the middle class.

[[Page S7001]]

Today I will focus on the jobless recovery and the general problem of 
unemployment.
  Few things matter more to a working family than the pace of the 
economy, especially after a hard recession. If on the one hand, it is a 
rapid, strong recovery, jobs will return quickly, people will return to 
the workforce, and a great deal of social suffering will be averted.

  If, on the other hand, it is a slow recovery, then businesses don't 
create many new jobs, wages stagnate or fall, as they have been doing, 
and families continue to borrow from their savings to pay their bills. 
Life is spent wondering and worrying about the future.
  We live today in the slowest economic recovery--they called it an 
economic recovery--since the end of World War II. No recovery from a 
recession since the end of World War II has been as slow as this one. 
Not counting the Great Recession, we have had 11 recessions since 1945. 
All had faster, stronger recoveries than this one--with all of them we 
bounced back quicker.
  How slow is this economic recovery? Well, it has been nearly 6 years 
since the recession began in December of 2007. We still have not 
returned to the number of jobs we had 6 years ago. We haven't come back 
to the number of people working that we had 6 years ago. We are 
1,988,000 jobs--almost 2 million--short of the 146,273,000 jobs we had 
when the recession began. This is not good.
  Let's compare that with the other two bad postwar recessions: the 
contractions of 1973 through 1975 and 1981 and 1982--serious 
recessions. The recession of 1973 lasted 16 months. The recession of 
the 1981 collapse lasted 16 months, and the recession of 2007 lasted 
until June of 2009, or 18 months.
  Working people were hit hard by these two earlier recessions. The 
unemployment rate rose to 9 percent in 1975 and 10.8 percent in 1982. 
The highest monthly unemployment rate for the Great Recession of 2007 
to 2009 was 10 percent. Our unemployment rate didn't hit as high as 
1982. There is not much difference in the severity and length of these 
recessions. They were pretty similar.
  Even so, total jobs had recovered by 25 months after the start of the 
1973 recession and by 28 months after the recovery from the 1981 
recession. It has been 70 months, however, since the start of the 2007 
recession, and employment has not yet recovered.
  Lost hours of work is another and even better way to gauge the 
failure of the current recovery. It is not simply the number of jobs in 
the economy but the number of hours worked that strongly influences the 
pace of economic activity.
  In the fourth quarter of 2007, just as the recession was starting, 
Americans worked about 236 billion hours--that is a lot of hours. We 
still have not returned to that level.
  In the third quarter of 2013, this last quarter, the Labor Department 
estimated Americans still only worked 232 billion hours. That is a 
shortfall of 3.5 billion hours. This decline is greater per worker 
since the population of available workers has increased by 9 million. 
So we have got 9 million more workers and a decline in the number of 
hours worked, and it is still well below what the number was in 2007. 
This is not the kind of recovery we need to be looking for.
  Still another way to show the slowness of this recovery is to measure 
how much higher GDP--the economy today--is compared to the start of the 
recession. It turns out that economic output is 4.4 percent higher. 
Compare this with the 1973 and 1981 recessions. By this time after the 
1973 recession, GDP was 17.9 percent higher, and GDP after the 1981 
recession by this time was 20 percent higher. That is, the economy was 
20 percent bigger by this time after the 1981 recovery.
  Our current economy is only 4.4 percent larger. The 1981 economic 
gains were five times as great as this.
  These are the top line numbers. What do they mean to real people? 
Below this surface we find extensive economic suffering throughout our 
Nation. There are 25 percent more discouraged workers today--988,000 
versus 793,000--than there were in June of 2009 when the recession 
ended. We had 366,000 discouraged workers when the recession started in 
2007, which means we have had an increase of 172 percent in this sad 
number in 6 years.
  One of the most stunning developments of this recovery has been the 
decline in the labor force participation rate. This is a fundamental 
indicator of the breadth and depth of a recovery and of economic 
growth. Today 58.7 percent of the noninstitutionalized population 16 
years of age and older is working--58.7 percent today. In 2007 that 
number stood at 62.7 percent. The current rate of labor force 
participation is the lowest this Nation has seen since 1978. The 
percentage of the population working today in the age group of workers 
is the lowest it has been since 1978, and it is not getting better.
  This decline is due to two factors: increased unemployment, and labor 
force dropouts--discouraged people who are no longer even looking for 
work.

  How many people are we talking about? If the same percentage of the 
population was working today as was working in 2007, we would have 
154,089,000 workers. Since we currently only have 144,285,000 million 
people working, it appears that 9,804,000 people are out of the labor 
force--9 million normally expected to be working are out of the labor 
force.
  When they are out of the labor force, it does not show up in the 
unemployment rate. It is only people who are actually applying for jobs 
who show up in the unemployment rate. So the unemployment rate we see 
today hides the real depth of the unemployment problem we have in 
America.
  Of the 5.7 million who totally dropped out, more retirements and more 
disability than in 2007 explain about two-thirds of those dropouts. 
People went on disability, went on retirement. Many of them went on 
retirement at 62 when it would have been better if they could have had 
a decent job opportunity to work to 65, 66, 70, but they have dropped 
out because they are older workers, perhaps, and were unable to find 
decent work. But it cannot be good for America for millions of people 
to take their Social Security at 62 rather than later, too often 
because no work is available.
  More than 4 million unemployed Americans have been out of work for 
more than 27 weeks--4 million--more than half the year they have been 
unemployed. All told, 11.5 million Americans want to work but cannot 
find jobs.
  The unemployment rate for those between the ages of 16 and 19 who are 
not in school or in the military or in prison stands at 24 percent. So 
teenagers have a very large number, and the number is much higher for 
minority teenagers and young men particularly. This is the highest 
teenage unemployment has ever been this far into a recovery. It is very 
dangerous for our society to have so many young people--especially 
young men whose unemployment rates are even higher than females--out of 
work. This is not good for America.
  We need to have a growing economy that creates jobs, and we don't 
need to be bringing in--under the immigration bill that passed the 
Senate, we don't need to be bringing in twice the number of low-skilled 
workers as we have been doing, as we have a generous immigration 
policy. This bill would double the number of guest workers coming into 
America to take jobs that children need to be doing. They need to be 
working. We don't need teenagers and young people--19, 20, 22, 23--with 
nothing to do month after month, year after year.
  At 13 percent, unemployment among African Americans is about twice 
the national average of 7.4 percent. Unemployment among Hispanics 
stands at 9.4 percent. Unemployment among those with less than a high 
school education is 11 percent. But we want to bring in millions of 
people without high school educations to compete for the few jobs that 
are out there.
  Again, these statistics, as bad as they are, mask the real-life 
implications of the slow economy. These are young careers that have 
failed to launch when they should, marriages perhaps put off until the 
economy improves, families not started until couples can afford 
children--a generation of children that arrive out of wedlock. We have 
retirements taken too early, loss of homes, perhaps; older children at 
home who should be out on their own, and we would normally expect them 
to be working; and lots of part-time, extra jobs at lower pay just to 
make ends meet.
  Indeed, one of the most devastating statistics is the growth in part-
time work instead of full-time work. It is a

[[Page S7002]]

stunning number. We have 5,188,000 fewer full-time jobs today than in 
December of 2007--5 million fewer. That equals a decrease in full-time 
employment of 4.3 percent, even though our population is growing.
  At the same time, part-time employment has grown by 3 million over 
this same time period. That is an increase in part-time jobs of 13 
percent. So make no mistake, the total number of jobs since 2007 is 
down, and for the people who are finding work, the work they find too 
often can only be part time.
  Now 77 percent of the people who got a job since January of this year 
got a part-time job, not a full time job. When we see, colleagues, the 
reports of 190,000 jobs, 200,000 jobs, remember, 77 percent of those 
are part-time jobs. Those numbers hide the reality of the danger in our 
workforce.
  Nearly 90 percent of the increase in part-time work represents people 
who, according to the Labor Department, ``could only find part-time 
work.'' In other words, they would like full-time but could only find 
part-time work. At the end of 2007, this number stood at 1.2 million. 
However, the most recent data shows that this population has grown by 
127 percent to 2,714,000--a 127-percent increase in this number.
  Job growth in the economy since 2007 has been principally in part-
time work. We are becoming a part-time economy.
  The President's health care law, without any doubt--I don't believe 
any economist, even if they try to sugar-coat it the best they could, 
would deny that the President's health care law is playing a major 
factor from the shift from full-time work to part-time work. As we all 
know, part-time workers don't enjoy the same health, retirement, 
vacation, and other benefits as full-time workers do. It is exceedingly 
hard indeed to succeed in this economy and in a career with only a 
part-time job.
  We must recognize one of the biggest contributors to the decline in 
full-time jobs is the health care bill we have been debating. As others 
have observed, it is destroying the 40-hour workweek. That is what a 
union leader said: It is destroying the 40-hour workweek. It is even an 
assault on workers.
  Let me tell my colleagues about one constituent who wrote my office. 
Linda Askew, from Sheffield, AL, wrote in July, asking Congress to do 
something to help. Ms. Askew has a small neighborhood business. She 
employs less than 10 people. According to Ms. Askew:

       We have been here for almost 50 years. We have tried to 
     help our employees have health care for over 10 years now . . 
     . The new premiums are $590 per month for single coverage and 
     $1,520 for family coverage. . . . These costs are almost 
     becoming unbearable for our company. More troubling than 
     that, in the letter--

  she got a letter from her insurance company--

     was that part of the reason for this increase was blamed on a 
     new health care reform fees and taxes that health insurers 
     must pay on behalf of all their groups . . .

  So to reduce the cost of health care in America, the health care bill 
raised taxes on the insurance companies that provide it. It gets passed 
along.
  She continues:

       Small businesses cannot keep up with these increases.

  In the coming days, as I document the conditions facing American 
workers, I will also address the many causes of this economic 
deterioration--and there are many. There are many causes for the 
deterioration in the economy. Republicans and Democrats need to heed 
these problems I have stated, including a decline in wages, beginning 
in 1999 through a different administration.
  The question is, What are we going to do about it, Republicans and 
Democrats? We need to consider these issues and deal with them.

  What we are seeing is immensely troubling. As Washington grows 
larger, Washington grows wealthier and more powerful, American workers 
are being impoverished, sidelined, and marginalized. We see the numbers 
showing that the only area of America that has been showing raised 
growth is Washington. Washington! The government class is being 
enriched at the expense of the middle class. From deficit spending to 
Federal regulation to the immigration bill, Washington is pursuing 
policies that benefit lobbyists, the well-connected, government 
employees, regulators, and bureaucrats, but that are reducing the wages 
and job opportunities for everyday American workers. The numbers are 
clear.
  Both parties need to shut out the special interests, work to develop 
policies that will restore our history of dynamic economic growth--and 
we can do so--growth that benefits all the people of our Nation.
  What is the response we get from the governing class? What do they 
tell us the problem is? On the deficit, what do they say the problem 
is? We haven't spent enough money. It is your problem, American people. 
Just send us more money and we won't have deficits anymore. Trust us. 
Send us more money. The President proposed a $1 trillion tax increase 
in his budget. It was rejected, but that is what he proposed and that 
is what he advocates for. So they want to spend more.
  They believe they can invest. We give the government more money, and 
it is going to invest in the economy and everybody is going to be 
better off. But we have seen that movie. It has been going on for 5 
years, to a degree unprecedented in the history of America. They say, 
Don't worry, borrow and spend. Don't worry about the debt. We can just 
borrow more and spend more and that will stimulate the economy.
  They say we need to regulate more. We need to block more American 
energy and import more, I suppose, from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and 
that is going to improve our economy. Really? We are going to drive up 
the cost of energy and coal and that is going to improve jobs in 
America? That is going to help a working person who now has to pay 
$200, $250 a month for his gas bill to commute? That is supposed to be 
good for us?
  All we have heard is more taxes, more regulation, more government, 
more debt. That is the policy we are seeing here. I haven't seen 
anything that has the power to produce the growth and prosperity that 
we need.
  So I say we have to get over this. We have tried this. It is not 
working. These policies have made it worse. We have to get back to 
classical American policies that validate individual responsibility, 
that allow people to progress and make more, that don't drive us to 
import more oil, that don't put regulation by massive numbers all over 
the economy, driving down productivity and driving up costs. That is 
the kind of thing we need to be doing. If we will do that, and if we 
will allow the vitality of the American spirit to flourish and flower 
and get this burden off the backs of our people, I think we will be 
surprised how much better things can be.
  It is a serious crisis. This trend has been going on far too long. We 
can't ignore it. We can't say it is just the recession. We have been 
going along like this since 2007. We have not seen the growth we need. 
The tax and spend and borrow policies haven't worked. It is time for us 
to confront that. I hope my colleagues will.
  I will continue to examine the data we are seeing out there and share 
it with my colleagues and maybe we can surprise ourselves how much good 
we can do in the long run.
  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.

                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday I was visited by several 
hospitals from Chicago. Mount Sinai is an amazing hospital. It 
originally--you can tell by its name--was founded by Jewish families 
living in a section of Chicago. The families have moved on. The 
remaining population is largely African American and Hispanic. It is a 
very poor neighborhood. It is a violence-ridden neighborhood. But in an 
amazing show of magnanimity and charity, many of the Jewish families 
whose ancestors and predecessors predated them and founded this 
hospital continue to support Mount Sinai. It is a beacon of quality 
medical care in one of the toughest, meanest neighborhoods in that 
great city.
  They came to speak yesterday, to meet with me. They just merged with 
another extraordinary hospital, Holy Cross Hospital in Marquette Park. 
I have a special affection for this hospital because for decades it was 
run by the Sisters of St. Casimir, a Lithuanian Catholic order of nuns 
who devoted their lives first to the Lithuanian population that lived 
in that neighborhood and then, after that population left, to those who 
came after them, many of them very poor people.
  Mount Sinai and Holy Cross merged, and between the two of them, I 
can't think of better examples of hospitals with a mission to help the 
poorest people and to make certain they have care that all of us would 
like to have for our families. They came yesterday to talk to me about 
the Affordable Care Act.
  There are so many speeches on the floor about the Affordable Care 
Act. Most of them from the other side of the aisle are entirely 
negative. But there are some things about the Affordable Care Act which 
were brought to my attention from these two intercity hospitals which I 
think we should all look at carefully.
  First, they are telling me that at these hospitals more people are 
showing up and paying. In days gone by, many of those who came in for 
services were charity cases. The cost of their service was passed on to 
everyone else. Now, under the Affordable Care Act, many of these lower-
income families have health insurance for the first time in their 
lives.
  I have met some of these families, and I know what it means to them. 
It was several years ago when I was approached by the chairman of the 
Cook County board, Toni Preckwinkle, the president, and we asked for a 
waiver from the Obama administration to enroll families in Cook County 
in the Medicaid portion of the Affordable Care Act before it actually 
went into effect.
  We were given that waiver. We now have 100,000 individuals in Cook 
County--low-income individuals--who have Medicaid protection.
  This Medicaid protection has allowed them to have quality health 
insurance for the first time in their lives, in many cases, and also it 
means when they present themselves for care in hospitals, they are 
paying. They are paying through the Medicaid program rather than coming 
in as charity cases.
  What we are finding as well is that as more and more Americans have 
the option of health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, the 
percentage of Americans who are uninsured has gone down. The share of 
adults without health insurance declined to 13.4 percent last month 
from 15.6 percent just a few months before. It is an indication of more 
and more people in America having the peace of mind that comes with 
health insurance coverage.
  I see the Senator from Kentucky is here, and I know he reserved the 
floor this morning, and I don't want to take his time.
  I also want to make the point as well that as we are bringing in more 
cost savings in health care through the Affordable Care Act, we are 
seeing the overall increase in health care costs starting to decline 
and slow down. That is what we were shooting for--more and more 
accessibility in coverage, more affordability for those who have that 
coverage and the overall cost in health care systems starting to come 
down. It is an experiment which is starting to show good results.
  Let me add that as proud as I am to have supported this law, it is 
not perfect. There are things we need to do to improve it and to refine 
it. We should do those on a bipartisan basis. That is what we are 
waiting for.
  The House of Representatives has now voted--I believe the number is 
50 times--to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I hope they have gotten it 
out of their system and now will sit down with us and work on a 
bipartisan basis to make it a better law. We can do that and we should 
do it together.
  So I commend this effort to both sides of the aisle--in the Senate as 
well as in the House--and I hope that we can achieve something that 
will make a difference.

[[Page S3198]]

  I would like to close by mentioning two of my constituents in 
Illinois before I turn the floor over to the Senator from Kentucky.
  Philosophy Walker is a 28-year-old graduate student in biblical 
studies at the University of Chicago. Her husband Adam is 31 years old 
and a part-time youth minister. Philosophy's school provides health 
insurance, but it is $900 per month for her and her husband. That would 
require them to take out additional student loans to pay their health 
insurance while they are in school.
  Before moving to Chicago, they were paying $700 per month for health 
insurance through COBRA, which is an option for those who have lost 
health insurance--but an expensive one. The $700 payment depleted their 
savings because her husband struggled to find a full-time job. Going 
without health insurance wasn't an option because Philosophy Walker has 
some severe allergy problems.
  Last November they signed up through the Affordable Care Act exchange 
and purchased a plan comparable to the COBRA coverage that had cost 
them $700 a month, but the plan also included dental insurance, which 
they never had before.
  Philosophy and her husband Adam, under this Affordable Care Act plan, 
pay $200 a month. It went from $700 to $200. Philosophy also receives 
her monthly allergy medication for free, rather than the previous $10 
monthly copay.
  If we listen to some of the stories on the floor of the Senate, you 
would never believe this story, but it is true.
  I wish also to talk about Laurel Tyler, who runs a small business 
with her husband in Illinois. Because they have two employees and one 
of the children of one of their employees has asthma, the policies they 
were sold in the past were extremely expensive.
  Because of the Affordable Care Act and the Illinois marketplace, 
Laurel's business is going to save 20 percent on health care costs, and 
the 22-year-old son with asthma can stay on the employee's plan. That, 
to me, is a success story.
  Let's build on that success. Let's work together to make this law 
even stronger.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.

                         ACA AND BREAST CANCER

  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight how the 
Affordable Care Act is already helping thousands of breast cancer 
survivors and those with preexisting conditions.
  In late 2007, I heard those terrible words, ``You have breast 
cancer.'' I underwent seven surgeries, but in some ways, I was one of 
the fortunate ones because I had health insurance coverage.
  I have spoken to women who have foregone mammograms and even cancer 
treatments because the cost was simply too great to bear. Now, the 
Affordable Care Act emphasizes prevention by making it possible for 
Americans to get screenings, like mammograms, without a copay.
  It also finally ends the egregious practice of denying coverage to 
patients with preexisting conditions, like my south Florida constituent 
Carolyn Newman, a survivor who will save $7,000 a year with an 
affordable plan, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. She can save even 
more by shopping on the exchange.
  With the Affordable Care Act making it possible for more women to 
access preventive services and not be denied coverage, we can work to 
eradicate breast cancer once and for all.

             REPEALING THE JOB-KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 19, 2011

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act that passed in 2010 is the law of the land. It extends historic 
protections to millions of Americans, ensuring access to quality health 
care. I voted for this law and I am grateful for the support I received 
from my constituents in Minnesota's fourth district for my work on 
reforming our nation's broken health care system.
  Access to quality health care is essential for all Americans. I 
firmly believe health care should be a right for our citizens, not a 
privilege or a luxury only for the most fortunate who can afford it. I 
am committed to working

[[Page E93]]

to ensure all Americans have the health protections they need and 
access to the quality health care they deserve. The health reform law 
we have in place does this.
  Today the U.S. House is debating the repeal of the Affordable Care 
Act. The Republican-Tea Party majority officially titled the bill 
before us, H.R. 2, the ``Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law 
Act.'' They use the word ``killing'' five times in a bill that isn't 
even two pages long. Not only is the bill's title offensive and 
disrespectful, it is untrue. The fact is the health reform law does not 
kill jobs, its patient protections save lives and create jobs. More 
than 200,000 health care related jobs have been created since the law 
passed in March of last year.
  This Tea Party Republican bill strips away patient protections for 
children, seniors, and adults with pre-existing medical conditions. It 
replaces tough legal protections for patients with a uniquely 
Republican solution--nothing. Republicans strip away protections for 
millions of Americans, add $230 billion to the federal budget deficit 
according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, and restore 
a broken health care system which empowers insurance companies, not 
patients.
  I want Minnesotans to know exactly what repealing the existing health 
reform law would do. If this Republican bill were to become law it 
would mean:
  Stripping 32 millions of Americans of health insurance and new 
consumer protections;
  Allowing insurers to deny coverage to children with pre-existing 
conditions, apply restrictive lifetime coverage limits, impose cost 
sharing on preventative care, and retroactively cancel a policy when an 
individual gets sick;
  Eliminating tax credits for as many as 99,000 Minnesota small 
businesses providing their employees health insurance;
  Refusing 11,400 young adults in Minnesota the option to remain on 
their parents' health insurance until they turn 26;
  Maintaining a perverse payment system that rewards providers for the 
volume of services delivered, rather than the quality of those 
services;
  Jeopardizing the early retiree health coverage provided by 210 
Minnesota employers and unions currently receiving financial assistance 
through the ``The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program''; and
  Risking the Medicare benefits and prescription drug coverage seniors 
and people with disabilities depend on to meet their health needs.
  H.R. 2 is more than political posturing. It is legislation that sends 
a clear message to the American people: Republicans care more about 
protecting insurance company profits than protecting the rights of 
patients. I will oppose this bill and I will oppose and battle against 
every effort made in the 112th Congress to defund, sidetrack, or stall 
the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
  I am not alone is opposing H.R. 2. Hundreds of national organizations 
and dozens of Minnesota groups oppose this blatantly partisan effort to 
repeal health reform. Here are a few excerpts from letters I received 
over the past few days.
  The Minnesota Medical Association: ``the MMA opposes efforts to 
repeal the ACA (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) and urges 
you to vote against it.''
  Catholic Hospital Association of Minnesota: ``I strongly urge you to 
maintain support for efforts to improve and strengthen our nation's 
health care system by opposing the legislation before the House to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA).''
  Epilepsy Foundation of Minnesota: ``We strongly encourage you to vote 
against repeal of the ACA and work toward ensuring that implementation 
includes the needs of people with epilepsy and other chronic health 
conditions.''
  Minnesota Hospital Association: ``On behalf of the 148 hospital and 
17 health system members of the Minnesota Hospital Association, I am 
writing to express our opposition to legislation that would repeal the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).''
  Today, as the debate on this ill conceived and mean-spirited bill is 
taking place, I received the following message from a consortium of 
small business leaders from across the country:
  The House of Representative's introduction of a bill to repeal the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is an affront to our 
nation's small business community.
  The country's 28 million small businesses stand to benefit greatly 
from many provisions of the new healthcare law, particularly the tax 
credits and health insurance exchanges. These two provisions will help 
drive down costs and offer small business owners more choices when 
purchasing insurance. These critical provisions and many others would 
be abolished if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.
  This would be a huge setback to entrepreneurs who need solutions to 
the broken healthcare system, not a continuation of it. America's 22 
million self-employed would also suffer, as a repeal of the ACA would 
deny them the opportunity to pool together and purchase insurance at an 
affordable price through state exchanges.
  It is important to remember that the Republican's dangerous and 
destructive health repeal agenda can only work if Americans are silent 
and passive, allowing live-saving rights and protections to be stripped 
away. Repeal will not happen today, even if this bill is passed, but 
over the course of the next two years Republicans and their corporate 
benefactors will use every legal and political channel available to 
deny citizens their health care rights. They will not stop.
  But I will not stop either. I will not stop fighting for the health 
care rights for all Americans.
  I urge all Minnesotans and all Americans to stand up and join me in 
the fight to protect the historic patient rights all citizens have 
gained through the Affordable Care Act and that starts with a vote 
against H.R. 2.

     THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER TO RESULT IN LOSS OF JOBS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. We are 6 months and 6 days away from the full weight of 
the President's takeover of American health care. It's like a train 
that's careening down the tracks on a collision course with the 
American economy. Last week, Gallup released a survey of small business 
owners, and it's even worse than it looks:
  Almost half of small business owners reported that they have frozen 
hiring because of the Affordable Care Act. Another 20 percent said that 
they have already had to lay off workers because of this law. So that's 
one out of every five small businesses laying off people because of 
legislation the administration has forced on hardworking Americans. 
That's a staggering number of people who are going to have to suffer 
because of the administration's shortsighted policy.
  The President and his allies are under the faulty impression that 
educating people about the Affordable Care Act will suddenly make it 
popular and make it work. The truth is that people are already finding 
out far too much about this law as it costs them and their family 
members jobs. We have to continue highlighting the destructive parts of 
this law before it destroys an already weak economy.

                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have come a long way in 1 year.
  On December 24, 2009--1 day before Christmas--this body passed a 
radical overhaul of our Nation's health care system. That is right. The 
majority passed ObamaCare on Christmas Eve.
  It was not this body's finest moment. It was not the administration's 
finest moment. And I expect that this debate will go down in history 
for its persistent lack of attention to the considered views of 
ordinary Americans--Americans who rejected ObamaCare's giant new 
entitlement expansions and the job-killing taxes haphazardly cobbled 
together to pay for them.
  It did not have to be this way. In the midst of the greatest fiscal 
collapse since the Great Depression, Americans wanted Democrats, who 
controlled all of the levers of power in Washington, to focus on job 
creation. Instead, like teenagers set loose when mom and dad leave 
town, they did what they wanted to, and focused on a government 
takeover of the Nation's health care system.
  Surprising only the most ideologically driven, support for ObamaCare 
cratered during the townhall meetings of August 2009. The message was 
loud and clear. Our health care system, and in particular the 
government policies that contribute to unsustainable inflation in the 
health care sector, might be in need of reform. But the solution to our 
problems is not additional government regulation and control of health 
care delivery by Washington bureaucrats. And the solution is most 
definitely not to be found in the billions of dollars in new taxes, 
most of which will be passed through to American families in the form 
of higher premiums.
  For those who did not deliberately put on blinders, the wishes of 
their constituents were obvious.
  Stop the push for ObamaCare and move onto fixing the economy.
  But the Senate did not listen.
  Instead, prodded ahead by an administration that saw the great 
liberal dream of government-run health care slipping, the long march 
continued.
  First, the Democratic majority cut short the Finance Committee's 
bipartisan negotiations.
  Then, heads down, the majority plowed forward on the floor, allowing 
virtually no meaningful amendments.
  And before going home for Christmas, it passed the most sweeping 
reform of the Nation's economy in over 70 years without a single 
Republican vote.
  Every Democratic senator supported the bill.
  Not one Republican did.
  When ObamaCare passed the Senate, its proponents assumed it was on 
the

[[Page S374]]

glidepath to enactment. But the American people had a different idea.
  Our national unemployment rate was 10.2 percent--the highest in 26 
years.
  The American people understood that at a moment of historic economic 
challenges, the last thing the country needed was another budget-
busting entitlement and sky-high taxes.
  And just about 1 month later, this message was delivered again. In a 
new shot heard across the world, our colleague, the junior Senator from 
Massachusetts, Scott Brown, was elected in a very clear referendum on 
the Democrats' health care bill.
  The verdict of the American people, if the previous summer's 
townhalls left any doubt, was now crystal clear.
  The push for ObamaCare must end.
  Yet, the administration refused to yield.
  They thought the people would eventually come to embrace the elegance 
of ObamaCare. If only the messaging was better, Americans would 
appreciate all of the good things that Washington politicians and 
bureaucrats had to offer them.
  So after taking time to regroup and weigh their options, Democrats 
decided to defy the American people yet again.
  A little over a year ago, the President hosted a summit at the White 
House and began his final push for his federalizing of American health 
care.
  The resulting display was ugly. Americans, already revolted by the 
deals cut in this Chamber to secure the bare number of votes needed to 
pass the bill, now witnessed historic arm twisting and desperate 
efforts in the House to deny the obvious--that ObamaCare represented an 
unprecedented intrusion of the Federal government into the lives of 
citizens and clearly was a massive burden on taxpayers.
  And so it passed.
  And ObamaCare became law.
  And the administration set about writing the thousands of pages of 
regulations that would govern how American businesses provide health 
benefits to their employees.
  Fast forward to November of 2010.
  The American people did not forget their snubbing by self-proclaimed 
progressive Democrats who in fact ignored the will of the people at 
every opportunity during the ObamaCare debate.
  At voting booths across the country, they made clear to those 
congressmen and Senators who provided the votes for this job-destroying 
health care bill that such high-handed, illiberal behavior was not 
acceptable in a democratic republic.
  Fast forward one more time.
  Yesterday, barely 13 months after ObamaCare passed the Senate, and 
less than one year since it became law, the entire scheme was struck 
down in Federal court.
  In a triumph for both personal liberty and the American Constitution, 
the individual mandate was found unconstitutional and ObamaCare was 
struck down.
  Not part of ObamaCare.
  All of ObamaCare.
  Not surprisingly, the administration and its special interest allies 
responded with the same derision toward ordinary American citizens that 
has been on display throughout this debate. Instead of acknowledging 
the obvious--that ObamaCare represents a massive departure from any 
traditional understanding of limited government--White House officials 
went on the attack, calling the decision outside of the mainstream and 
ridiculing its reasoning.
  Really?
  Millions and millions of Americans believe that provisions essential 
to the operation of ObamaCare are unconstitutional intrusions on 
personal liberty that vastly expand the power of the Federal 
government.
  They understand that the justification for the individual mandate by 
ObamaCare's proponents essentially removes any limits on the power of 
the Federal government to regulate personal and economic decisions.
  Twenty-six states participated in this challenge to ObamaCare.
  Thirty-two Members of this body, including myself, signed an amicus 
brief challenging the constitutionality of ObamaCare.
  But, according to the administration's narrative, we are the ones who 
are out of the mainstream.
  This administration came into office buoyed by the good will of the 
American people and carrying banners of bipartisanship.
  Two years later, after the politically disastrous decision to 
overhaul one-seventh of the Nation's economy with virtually no 
Republican support, they are blaming the victim.
  After a Federal judge looked at this tough issue and determined that 
key elements of ObamaCare represented an unprecedented and 
unconstitutional expansion of the national government, the problem 
remains--as it always is for liberals--the people.
  Their views are just not sophisticated enough to grasp ObamaCare's 
consistency with a government of limited and enumerated powers.
  The Democrats continue to think that if only they focus group 
ObamaCare better, they will get the messaging right.
  The American people will learn to love it.
  I don't think so.
  The American people get it. I know my constituents in Utah do.
  In an article yesterday in ``Politico'', Patrick Caddell and Douglas 
Schoen highlighted the reasons for the public's deepening disdain for 
ObamaCare. According to them, it is possible that no major piece of 
legislation ``has created the continued, vehement public opposition 
that health care has provoked since the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.''
  In their view, ``[t]here is one big underlying factor that continues 
to cause many Americans to oppose the health care bill: Its passage was 
anti-democratic. If the Republicans' campaign slogan of 1854 was the 
Crime Against Kansas, in 2010 it would be the Crime Against 
Democracy.''
  Americans know that the Senate bill was 2,074 pages long.
  They know it authorized 70 government programs.
  They know it delegated regulatory power to the Obama administration 
1,697 times.
  They know it cut $465 billion from Medicare at a time when it already 
faced a $38 trillion unfunded liability.
  They know the bill took from one already unsustainable entitlement to 
pay for a brand new entitlement.
  They know it raised taxes by over $550 billion, repeatedly violating 
the President's pledge not to raise taxes on middle class families.
  They know ObamaCare will destroy 695,000 American jobs at a time when 
millions of Americans are looking for work.
  They know the Medicaid expansions threaten to bankrupt the States, 
with CBO estimating that the Medicaid expansion will cost American 
taxpayers $435 billion over 10 years.
  They know the total cost of ObamaCare is $2.6 trillion.
  And they know we can not afford it.
  To borrow from Justice Scalia, the American people despise ObamaCare 
because the American people love democracy and the American people are 
not fools. They know that this law was enacted in a totally partisan 
manner, and over the loud opposition of a majority of Americans.
  And they know that the partisans promoting ObamaCare were not, and 
are not, forthright when they say it is budget neutral.
  ObamaCare cuts $155 billion from hospitals.
  It cuts $202 billion from 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage.
  It cuts nearly $15 billion from nursing homes.
  It cuts nearly $40 billion from home health agencies.
  It cuts nearly $7 billion from hospices.
  But these cuts don't go toward strengthening Medicare, a program with 
catastrophic unfunded liabilities. Rather, Democrats poured the savings 
from these cuts back into a brand new entitlement program.
  Furthermore, so-called comprehensive health care reform managed to 
neglect the pressing need for a permanent doc fix. Yet, CBO's most 
recent estimate is that a long-term doc fix freezing Medicare payment 
rates at 2011 levels would raise the deficit by $249 billion, not 
counting an additional $53 billion in debt service obligations.
  Not surprisingly, an Associated Press fact check of the President's 
State of the Union address concluded: ``the idea that Obama's health 
care law saves money for the government is based on some arguable 
assumptions.''

[[Page S375]]

  That might qualify for the understatement of the year so far.
  The likelihood that ObamaCare will not, as its advocates claimed, 
save the government money was confirmed again at a hearing last week by 
the CMS Chief Actuary Richard Foster. He testified that the law will 
not likely hold costs down, and that contrary to the President's 
mantra, everyone will not be able to keep their insurance coverage if 
they like it.
  In response, the White House political operation attacked the 
Administration's own nonpartisan professional expert, stating in a blog 
post: ``Once again, we disagree . . . History shows that it is possible 
to implement measures that will save money for Medicare and the Federal 
government.''
  Who are you going to believe?
  The chief actuary at CMS or a White House political operative?
  The average American citizen might not have a Ph.D. in economics. But 
Americans do understand that massive new entitlement programs do not 
save money. In their guts, they know that former CBO director Doug 
Holtz-Eakin is right when he concludes that repeal of this flawed law 
would actually reduce the deficit by $300 billion.
  Ultimately, all we want is a vote on repeal.
  Last week, some of my Democratic colleagues came to the floor to 
advocate for rules changes that would have substantially limited the 
rights of the minority to debate.
  The filibuster, they insisted, is an affront to democracy and 
majority rule.
  Well, let them put their money where their mouths are.
  All we are asking for is an up or down vote on repeal of ObamaCare.
  This is what the people want.
  Ultimately, you have to ask why the Democratic majority would deny us 
this vote.
  I think I know the answer. It has a great deal to do with members of 
the caucus who know their constituents hate this law. Yet, these 
Members are torn between two masters. On the one hand are their 
conservative constituents. And on the other are the liberal interest 
groups who supported the government takeover of the Nation's health 
care system.
  Unfortunately, the people again stand to lose in this calculus.
  I understand that the conventional wisdom is that my colleagues and I 
are pursuing a symbolic act.
  The guardians of the conventional wisdom opine that attempts to 
repeal ObamaCare might make for good theatre, but are senseless 
exercises.
  In my view, this attitude demonstrates a profound lack of respect for 
the citizens of a democratic republic.
  Over time, given the power of ideas and an engaged citizenry, 
initially symbolic acts have a way of becoming law. It might not happen 
overnight, but citizens--exercising their constitutional rights of 
petition and redress--have a way of reminding even the most hardened of 
partisan politicians that their job is to represent their constituents.
  I have no doubt that some scoff at our efforts to repeal this bill.
  But I rest easy knowing that I am standing with my fellow Utahans and 
the people of this country whose distrust of ObamaCare grows as they 
learn more about it.
  I look forward to the day when ObamaCare is finally repealed. It may 
not be next month. It may not be next year, but it will be repealed. If 
we are smart, we will make it next month or in the very near future. 
When it is, it will be a triumph for our Constitution, a triumph for 
personal liberty and, most importantly, it will be a triumph for the 
American people to persevere in their resistance to this law.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is interesting that we face one of 
the toughest economic recessions in modern history and a world in 
turmoil, as many countries are challenging their leadership and 
assessing the future, and the focal point of the Republican legislative 
effort appears to be the repeal of health care reform.
  If you look at what the American people think about this, they don't 
agree. They think that if there are ways to improve the bill, we should 
do it; that if there are changes we can make in the bill to make it 
more effective, we should. But the notion that we would repeal this law 
and walk away from the basic provisions in it is not acceptable by the 
majority of the people.
  The House Republicans, new to the majority this year, decided they 
needed to keep faith with their followers and repeal health care reform 
as their highest priority. As the whip in the Senate who counts votes 
on this side of the aisle, I sense that we are not going to repeal this 
law, nor do I think we should.
  It appears Republicans want us to spend some time debating whether 
health care reform is good for America. I welcome that debate because, 
as you know, when we reflect on what we have achieved so far, in a 
little over 1 year, with this health care reform and what is to follow, 
it strikes me as unusual that there are people who want to walk away 
from all that. The important starting point in this debate is 
government-administered health care. If you listen to the other side--
the Republicans--the issue they object to the most is the fact that the 
government has some hand in this health insurance industry. They call 
it government-run health care. Those who would take the time to read 
the bill--and I have--will realize that at the end of the day, the only 
entities offering health insurance in America are private companies, 
aside from Medicare and Medicaid. So what the Republicans are objecting 
to is a government effort to extend the availability of private health 
insurance to more and more Americans.
  I know every single Republican and Democratic Senator is protecting 
their own families with government-administered private health 
insurance. The very thing they are condemning in the health care reform 
bill is the source of their own personal health insurance for their 
families. You see, Members of Congress are part of the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Program, a program that covers 8 million 
Federal employees and their families. My wife and I, each year, have an 
open enrollment where we can choose from nine different private health 
insurance companies in Illinois. We pick the plan we like the best. At 
our point in life, we have more coverage than younger people might, and 
more money is taken out of my paycheck because of that decision, but it 
is our decision to pick this private insurance company in a plan 
administered by the Federal Government.
  As the Republicans stand and criticize the notion of extending this 
availability of options to more Americans, they are criticizing the 
same insurance plan they are using to protect their own families. If it 
is good enough for a Member of the Senate, should it not be good enough 
for most Americans? The insurance exchanges we are creating will offer 
the option for people to choose from private health insurance plans in 
the future. That, to me, is a good thing. It has certainly been good 
for my family, in terms of the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Program.
  There are other parts of the health care reform bill the Republicans 
want to repeal, which I know the American people think are very 
valuable. Right now, young adults up to the age of 26 would lose their 
insurance coverage through their parents' health plans if the 
Republicans prevail. This would affect 47,200 people in Illinois and 
1.2 million nationally. Who are these young people, age 25? They are 
graduates of college looking for jobs. They are finished with their 
education and maybe had student health insurance and they are looking 
for a job and maybe the first one they find doesn't offer benefits. So 
mom and dad say: Don't worry. We still have you under the family health 
insurance plan.
  That is part of the health care reform bill these people--the 
Republican side of the aisle--want to repeal. I remember going through 
this with our kids, as I am sure others do. You called them after 
college and said: Jennifer, how are you doing?
  I am fine.
  Do you have health insurance?
  Dad, I don't need that yet; I will get it later. At which point you 
say: Girl,

[[Page S376]]

you have to have it, even if we have to pay for it. We know we are just 
one diagnosis or accident away from needing health insurance. That 
worry is relieved for those through the age of 25 under health care 
reform and would be repealed by the Republicans.

  How about lifetime limits? People with private insurance coverage, if 
the Republicans have their way and repeal this measure, would find 
themselves suddenly vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed 
on how much insurance companies will spend on their health care. This 
affects 7\1/2\ million people in Illinois and 165 million nationally.
  I talked to a retired firefighter in Chicago. He happened to be a man 
who volunteered and went to New York on 9/11. He came down with 
leukemia. I said: How are you doing?
  He said: I'm feeling good. I'm getting a lot of treatment, and it's 
working, but I'm worried. I'm not old enough to qualify for Medicare 
yet, and I have a $1 million limit. I had no idea I would come down 
with cancer, and I have already spent $150,000. If I need additional 
medical care, it will be taken out of my savings if I go past this 
limit.
  We eliminate the limits on health insurance policies. Repeal of the 
law will reestablish those limits.
  How about rescissions? Insurance companies, if the Republicans have 
their way and repeal our Affordable Health Care Act, would once again 
be allowed to cut off someone's coverage unexpectedly when they are in 
an accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on their 
application. That would leave 612,000 people in Illinois and 15.9 
million nationally at the risk of losing their insurance at the moment 
they need it the most. One of the worst abuses of the insurance 
industry would become legal again if the Republicans have their way and 
repeal affordable health care.
  How does this work? Well, I can tell you what happens. We have seen 
it. People have contacted our office. The most notorious example was a 
woman who said when she needed coverage for a surgery, the health 
insurance company went through her application and said: You failed to 
disclose a preexisting condition. We rescind the policy.
  She asked: What preexisting condition?
  You had acne as a teenager.
  Think about it. Would you ever put that down as a preexisting 
condition when you are applying for health insurance? It was enough for 
the health insurance company to turn her loose and refuse to cover her.
  Also, nearly 7.5 million residents in Illinois and 165 million 
nationally would not know if they are receiving value for their health 
insurance premium dollars because the Republican repeal of health care 
would remove the requirement that insurers spend at least 80 to 85 
percent of premium dollars on actual health care--not on bonuses, not 
on salaries, not on advertising, and not on administrative expenses but 
actually on health care. It is an effort to have the States monitor 
these health insurance companies and make sure when the rates go up the 
money being collected is actually going to health care. That would be 
eliminated if the Republicans have their way in repealing the 
Affordable Health Care Act.
  How about preventive care? Nearly 1.8 million seniors in Illinois who 
have Medicare coverage and 44 million nationally would be forced to pay 
a copay to receive important preventive services such as mammograms and 
colonoscopies, and they wouldn't receive a free annual wellness visit. 
We know what happens when a person doesn't have a lot of money and is 
in their senior status and they are faced with the possibility of 
getting a test. They put it off. The longer you put it off, 
unfortunately, it is more likely something bad will occur. The 
Republican repeal of health care would mean that this preventive care 
currently offered under the bill for Medicare recipients would be 
eliminated.
  Then there is the doughnut hole, or the gap in coverage, for Medicare 
prescription drugs for which 109,421 seniors in Illinois and 2.7 
million nationally would see significantly higher prescription drug 
costs if the Republicans are successful in repealing health care. Last 
year, these beneficiaries received a one-time, tax-free $250 rebate to 
help fill the gap for prescription drugs in the doughnut hole coverage 
gap.
  Medicare beneficiaries who fall into the doughnut hole in 2011 will 
be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand-name prescription 
drugs. Without this law, the burden of high prescription drug costs 
will hurt millions of Medicare beneficiaries across the country. That 
is the reality.
  What the Republicans would do with the repeal of health care is to 
say to seniors on fixed incomes: Turn to your savings; pull more out of 
your savings for the prescription drugs your doctor tells you that you 
need to stay well. We are filling that gap, that hole. They want to go 
back to the old days when seniors were on their own.
  There is the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, where 279 employers 
in my State and 4,748 nationally wouldn't receive help from this 
program. It is a program that provides businesses, schools, unions, 
State and local governments and nonprofits much needed financial relief 
to help early retirees and their families continue to have quality 
affordable health care coverage.
  Who are these people? One was in my family. My brother retired from 
working for a major corporation before he reached the age of 65. He had 
a heart attack and needed surgery and couldn't get insured. He had to 
wait until he was qualified for Medicare. This plan allows early 
retirees to find insurance before they qualify for Medicare and 
provides an incentive for that to happen. The repeal of this law by the 
Republicans would basically eliminate that program.
  So when they stand before us and tell us they are just doing the 
right thing--what Americans really want--I am afraid that isn't the 
case. Most Americans want us to keep health care reform--change it, 
modify it, if necessary, but not repeal it--because when we repeal it, 
these basic things I have described will be in trouble.
  What about this court case yesterday in Florida? It is getting a lot 
of attention today. A judge in Florida issued a decision in a case 
filed by 25 Republican attorneys general and Governors striking down 
the Affordable Health Care Act. This ruling is out of the mainstream of 
judicial reasoning in its treatment of precedent and in the type of 
analysis employed. I don't think it is likely to be upheld.
  Twelve Federal judges have already dismissed challenges to the 
constitutionality of the health reform bill, and two judges in the 
Eastern District of Michigan and Western District of Virginia have 
upheld the law. In one other case, a Federal judge in the Eastern 
District of Virginia issued a very narrow ruling on the 
constitutionality of the health reform law's individual responsibility 
provision and upheld the rest of the law.
  The ruling yesterday in Florida issued by Judge Vinson in the 
Northern District is a plain case of judicial overreaching. The judge 
declared the entire law was null and void, even though the only 
provision he found unconstitutional related to the individual 
responsibility provision. This decision is at odds with decades of 
established Supreme Court law which has consistently found that courts 
have a constitutional obligation to preserve as much of a statute as 
can be preserved.
  Under this view of the law, the estimated 4 million seniors who fall 
into the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap I mentioned earlier 
will pay higher prices for prescription drugs. If the judge from 
Florida has his way, 44 million seniors on Medicare will be denied 
access to preventive care, up to 4 million small businesses will not be 
eligible for tax credits to make health care more affordable, and new 
provisions that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage and 
the like will not become part of the law.
  History is on our side when it comes to this measure, Madam 
President. Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary Committee, at my request, is 
going to hold a hearing on the constitutionality of the Health Care 
Reform Act. It is the first congressional hearing on this issue. As a 
person who is aspiring to be the chairman of the Constitution 
Subcommittee, I asked this be the first subject we take up. The reason 
I am still aspiring is we haven't closed all of the negotiations about 
funding of committees, so nothing has become formal yet, but it is 
likely to occur.

[[Page S377]]

  What we will look at tomorrow is article I, section 8 of the 
Constitution. That is the article that specifically cites the powers 
that Congress--the Senate and the House--have. It is spelled out. In 
the course of spelling it out, it cites, among other things, that we 
have the power to tax, and we have the power related to provisions 
relating to commerce. It came to be viewed in the courts as interstate 
commerce--commerce between the States or between the United States and 
other nations.
  Those who are arguing that the health care reform bill is 
unconstitutional first argue that the health care insurance industry is 
not commerce. If the health care insurance industry--which offers 
industry across State lines to millions of Americans--is not commerce, 
and it affects 18 percent of our economy, then I don't know what 
commerce might be. I think that position is particularly weak.
  When it comes to the individual responsibility, or individual mandate 
system that is in the bill, the question is being asked of the court: 
Why is this necessary? Well, here is why it is necessary. If we say to 
insurance companies they don't have to insure anyone with a preexisting 
condition, then of course they are going to exclude people. But if we 
tell them they have to insure everybody, even those with preexisting 
conditions, then the obvious question is, when will a person buy 
insurance?
  If we don't have a responsibility on individuals to buy insurance, 
two things will occur: They will wait until they are sick to buy 
insurance, which completely destroys the risk model that insurance 
companies use, or they will present themselves, as they do today, to 
many hospitals for coverage and care, the cost of which is passed on to 
other people. So the individual responsibility section says: If you 
don't have insurance coverage, then you have to pay a tax penalty. And 
that is what many are objecting to. You cannot eliminate exclusions for 
preexisting conditions and not move more and more people into the risk 
pool at an earlier stage. If people can wait until the last minute to 
get into the risk pool, then the insurance model is destroyed. That is 
why it is in there.
  I think we will find, ultimately--and I hope we do--from the Supreme 
Court that what we have passed is entirely consistent with the 
regulations or powers given to Congress under article I, section 8 of 
the Constitution to deal with issues of commerce. Secondly, I think we 
will find that the imposition of a tax in this health care reform bill 
is clearly enumerated in the powers given to Congress to levy taxes, 
and what we have done is necessary and proper to reach the goal where 
we eliminate discrimination because of preexisting conditions in health 
insurance plans.
  That debate is ahead of us, but it is a debate we need to take up. I 
am happy to talk about the health care reform bill because I think it 
is moving in the right direction. It is not perfect--it can be 
improved--but if the Republicans want to repeal it, they are in for a 
fight because the important provisions we have to protect families and 
businesses need to be protected.
  What we want to bring up as soon as we can--when we get beyond this 
debate on health care repeal--is the reauthorization of the Federal 
Aviation Administration. We have been struggling with this issue for a 
long time, and we believe this bill, which our majority leader Harry 
Reid has asked to bring to the floor, creates and protects more than 
280,000 jobs by modernizing the air travel infrastructure and reducing 
costly delays. I think this is an important step forward not just to 
create jobs--and we need them very badly--but also to make certain our 
airplanes and airliners and all those who are serving us at the 
airports have a safer environment, establishing new standards for 
safety when it comes to the operation of our airlines.
  I think this is a critical issue, and I hope we can move to it soon. 
I am sorry we are going to be diverted into a debate on health care 
reform. But as I said, I think it is a welcome debate. It is time we 
brought some of these facts before the American people so they 
understand health care reform has real value to families and businesses 
across the United States, making health care insurance more affordable 
and more accessible.

                      EQUAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my 
colleagues in speaking up about women's health. As we approach the 
anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, I want to remind 
all of us about some of the challenges that women have faced before 
health reform was signed into law.
  Before health reform was signed into law, insurance companies could 
deny coverage to women due to so-called preexisting conditions like 
cancer or even simply having been pregnant. Insurance companies could 
force women to pay more for their coverage simply because of their 
gender. And now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women will be able 
to see their OB/GYN without a referral. You've heard that repeatedly 
today because that's critical and important to women. Women will have 
access to critical preventive services like birth control with no out-
of-pocket costs. And that ultimately saves health care expenses.
  Already, hundreds of men and women from all across San Diego have 
shared with me how important affordable access to contraception is for 
them and for their families. They can't afford to have it stripped away 
by this Congress.
  I urge my colleagues to build on these reforms to ensure that all 
women have equal access to health care.

                          ____________________

                           HEALTH CARE REFORM

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for 
yielding time. I'm proud to stand with her and with other Democratic 
Members in support of women's access to comprehensive, affordable 
health care, access that was greatly expanded by the Affordable Care 
Act which passed 2 years ago this week and which my Republican 
colleagues want to repeal.
  Thanks to health care reform, over 13 million previously uninsured 
women will gain access to health insurance. Thanks to health reform, 
insurance companies will no longer be allowed to discriminate against 
women by charging them higher premiums than men for the same exact 
policy or by denying them coverage altogether simply because they are 
women. Thanks to health care reform, millions of women with private 
insurance will no longer have to pay for preventive services like 
mammograms, cervical cancer screening, contraception, and a host of 
other services.
  As a dad of three daughters, as a grandfather of two granddaughters, 
and as a great grandfather of one great granddaughter, I am glad we did 
that. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, preventive services are 
already free for Medicare beneficiaries.
  If I had the time, I'd say the other benefits of this bill that we 
ought to keep, and I will not join my friend from New Hampshire in 
trying to repeal a provision of this act.

                              OBAMA CARES

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, I read my local paper this morning and 
read a reference by Richard Borreca, a reporter who said that the 
Affordable Care Act is known as ObamaCare. At first I cringed because 
that's the way Republicans refer to it. But then I thought about it, 
and you know what? You're absolutely right; Obama cares. That's why we 
have that law.
  Think about what he looked at in 2008 and 2009. There were 50 million 
people who were uninsured at a cost of $116 billion a year. That could 
bankrupt any family. But with the Affordable Care Act, think about what 
you have: women no longer have to be worried about being discriminated 
against as a preexisting condition; seniors don't have to worry, they 
can have preventative care and the doughnut hole will close; youth can 
be covered under their parents' plan to the age of 26; and small 
business can avail themselves of a tax credit.
  Yes, Madam Speaker, Obama cares, as do the Democrats.

            CONTINUED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR OUR SENIORS

  (Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, in 2010, the Affordable Care Act 
delivered a $250 check to seniors in my district who were struggling to 
cover the gap between the cost of their prescription drugs and their 
Medicare coverage. In 2011, these same seniors benefited from an 
average savings of $648 on their medications.
  For my well-meaning Republican colleagues who say health reform is 
hurting Medicare beneficiaries, I ask them to imagine spending two and 
three times that amount on prescription drugs per month.
  For most seniors, $648 is a significant savings. And it is just the 
beginning. The Affordable Care Act will provide more efficient care by 
bundling Medicare services, investing in our health care workforce, and 
focusing on quality.
  Replacing Medicare with vouchers would erase the progress we have 
already made toward prescription drug coverage and lead to fewer 
choices for beneficiaries.
  I encourage my colleagues to work with me on solutions that guarantee 
continued access to health care for our seniors.

      SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF HEALTH CARE LAW

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, today the Supreme Court announced plans 
to take up a judicial review of the President's health care law, the 
so-called Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This was signed 
into law in March of 2010.
  Now the Justices will consider if the Federal Government--indeed, the 
United States Congress--exceeded its authority by requiring that every 
American purchase health insurance by 2014.
  The American people have made it very clear throughout this process: 
Give us the reforms that will address the problems, but don't tinker 
with what is already working well. What people wanted was not a 2,900-
page bill that shatters the system that was working well for the vast 
majority of Americans.
  What Congress should have done was to tackle the problems that 
Americans who need help were requesting. We could have addressed and 
accomplished reform in stand-alone bills at a much lower cost. We've 
seen that the new health care law is not what the American people 
wanted, and I am encouraged that this law will now be heard before the 
highest court in the land, and I am hopeful for their expeditious and 
judicial removal of the Affordable Care Act.

   GOVERNOR HALEY BARBOUR SPEAKS AT CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH CARE CAUCUS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today the Congressional Health Caucus was 
joined by Governor Haley Barbour from Mississippi as part of our 
``Thought Leaders Series.'' His leadership in health care in his home 
State is an example of how States can take a more prominent role and, 
in doing so, bend the cost curve in the correct direction.
  In the last fiscal year, Medicaid, which is a joint Federal and State 
program, cost our country more than $400 billion, and the price is only 
expected to increase in the years to come. Governor Barbour has been a 
leader in transforming Medicaid in his home State. He has made 
commonsense decisions to reduce rising drug costs to ensure that people 
who are enrolled in the program are, indeed, eligible for the program. 
Coordinated care and increased compliance all have led to improved 
outcomes.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will only compound the 
financial problems that States are facing. In 2014, States will see 
their Medicaid enrollments grow substantially when all people below 138 
percent of the Federal poverty level will be covered. It is essential 
that we examine this and other parts of the Affordable Care Act to 
ensure that our States are not pushed into an even deeper budgetary 
crisis.

               INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT (IHCIA)

                             HON. DON YOUNG

                               of alaska

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 17, 2012

  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to a 
provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that I believe should be 
exempted from the wholesale repeal of ACA, and that is section 10221--
which is the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) provisions of 
the bill. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives not to 
forget that with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, there would 
also be a repeal of the permanent reauthorization of the IHCIA, which 
ensures that American Indians and Alaska Natives will have access to 
improved health care.
  The IHCIA amendments enacted in 10221 of ACA were developed 
completely separate from ACA and had a distinct legislative history. 
The IHCIA amendments were developed in a more than decade long process 
involving tribes, tribal organizations of the federal government on how 
best to update the quite out of date IHICA--which had its last major 
reauthorization in 1992.
  While I was a proponent of considering the IHCIA independently, 
ultimately the IHCIA provisions were included in ACA. The ACA was a 
legislative vehicle that was moving so that the IHCIA provisions could 
finally be enacted.
  There are a number of key provisions within IHCIA that will greatly 
enhance the well being of tribal communities. Such provisions include: 
new and expanded authorities for behavioral health prevention and 
treatment services; authorities for demonstration projects including 
projects for innovative health care facility construction and health 
professional shortages; and authority for the provision of dialysis 
services.
  The health of American Indian and Alaska Native people, who already 
endure some of the largest negative health disparities, should not be 
negatively affected because the IHCIA provisions, through chance, were 
included in ACA.

[Pages S1959-S1960]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me first congratulate Chairman Harkin for his 
remarks today but more than that the work that has preceded today on 
the health care bill. He was an ardent advocate for the prevention 
programs that save lives and money. It was a real pleasure to work with 
him at that time.
  Today is the second anniversary of the passage of the affordable care 
act. I wish to describe how the law is already making a difference for 
families in Rhode Island and across the country by drastically 
improving access to higher quality care, by addressing rising health 
care costs, and by protecting consumers.
  Look at the changes. Children with preexisting conditions were denied 
coverage--no longer. Lifetime limits on insurance policies left many 
American families struggling to pay medial care bills on their own--no 
longer. Insurers could cancel coverage for individuals who became 
sick--no longer.
  In addition, the law helps kids just out of school who all too often 
cannot get that first job with health insurance. It helps them to stay 
on their parents' insurance policies until age 26. For seniors, 
prescription drug costs are down as the Medicare doughnut hole begins 
to close. This is real change, and it hits home in my home State of 
Rhode Island. I hear from Rhode Islanders and I listen.
  I heard from Greg, a father in Providence, who told me about his 16-
year-old son Will. Will spends 2 hours every day undergoing treatment 
to keep his cystic fibrosis in check. In addition to his daily 
treatment and prescriptions, Will sees a specialist four times a year 
to monitor the disease. Greg said he often thinks about his son Will's 
future and whether his son will be able to maintain health insurance 
coverage and receive the treatment he needs.
  Thanks to the affordable care act, Will does not have to worry about 
insurance companies denying him coverage because he has a preexisting 
condition or fear that he will have to go without treatment because his 
medical bills will have pushed him over some arbitrary lifetime limit.

  As many as 374,000 Rhode Islanders, including 89,000 children similar 
to Will, can now receive the treatments they need free from lifetime 
limits on coverage. People who want to repeal ObamaCare should be ready 
to look Greg in the eye and tell him why they want to take that away 
from him and his son.
  Olive, a senior from Woonsocket, shared with me that her husband 
takes several medicines to help treat his Alzheimer's disease. A 3-
month supply for two of his medications costs close to $1,000. As Olive 
said: Those months go by quickly. Last year, Olive and her husband fell 
into the prescription drug doughnut hole in July. Without the 
affordable care act, they would have been responsible for paying the 
full cost of his medications out of pocket, but because of health care 
reform, Olive and her husband received a discount on their prescription 
drugs and saved $2,400 last year.
  Olive and her husband are 2 of the over 14,800 Rhode Islanders who 
received a 50-percent discount on brand-name prescription drugs when 
they hit the doughnut hole. This discount resulted in an average 
savings of over $550 per person, for a total savings of more than $8.2 
million for seniors in Rhode Island alone.
  People who want to repeal ObamaCare should be ready to look Olive in 
the eye and tell her why that $8.2 million should go back into the drug 
companies' pockets, why she and her husband should have to cough up an 
extra $2,400 for the drug companies.
  Brianne, a 22-year-old graduate of the University of Rhode Island, 
currently works part time as a physical therapy aid in Providence. Her 
job does not offer health insurance. Brianne suffers from several 
seasonal and food allergies. She makes frequent trips to her allergist. 
Because of the affordable care act, Brianne can stay on her mother's 
health insurance so she can continue to get the treatment she needs. 
Without this coverage, Brianne said, she would be hard-pressed to 
afford the treatments necessary to address her allergies.
  As of June of last year, Brianne was 1 of over 7,500 young adults in 
Rhode Island who gained insurance coverage as a result of the reform 
law. People who want to repeal ObamaCare need to explain to Brianne why 
she and those other 7,500 Rhode Island kids should be kicked off their 
parents' policy.
  The affordable care act has also brought needed relief to employers 
that are still the leading source of health coverage in the United 
States. Geoff is a small business owner in Providence. He provides 
health care insurance for his employees because, as he said, ``It's the 
right thing to do.'' But the rising costs of his employees' health 
insurance have placed increased pressure on his business. Geoff's 
business qualified for the health care law's small business health care 
tax credit, which covers up to 35 percent of premiums paid by a small 
business owners for its employees' coverage. These credits are a 
lifeline for small businesses that are struggling in today's difficult 
economy and for the people those small businesses employ. People who 
want to repeal ObamaCare need to look Geoff in the eye and tell him why 
they want to take away that tax credit lifeline that lets him provide 
coverage for his employees.
  The affordable care act also provided support for community health 
centers. In Rhode Island, similar to elsewhere in the country, 
community health centers fill a critical gap in our health care system, 
delivering comprehensive, preventive, and primary care to patients, 
regardless of their ability to pay.
  Dennis Roy is the CEO of the East Bay Community Action Program in 
Rhode Island. He tells me the affordable care act has provided critical 
support for his community health center's mission. East Bay has 
received $3 million through this law to construct a new community 
health center in Newport which, despite its international reputation, 
is one of Rhode Island's poorer cities. The new community health center 
will triple the available patient care space for needy Newport County 
residents.
  To date, Rhode Island community health centers have received $14.8 
million to create new health center sites in medically underserved 
areas. This is important American infrastructure, and we should not 
tear it down to make a political point or to assuage a political 
ideology. These stories are just a few of many that show how the 
affordable care act is working for Rhode Island families, seniors, and 
small businesses.
  Although we have made great progress, the work continues. Over the 
last 2 years, a tremendous effort has been made by the health care 
industry, by State and local leaders, and by the Obama administration 
to develop a better model of health care delivery, to shift from a 
system that is disorganized and fragmented to one that is coordinated, 
is efficient, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve.
  Private health care providers, such as Geisinger, Intermountain, and 
the Marshfield Clinic, are already focusing on quality rather than 
quantity, efficiency rather than volume, to better serve their patients 
and their bottom line. Because of the affordable care act, the Federal 
Government now has the opportunity to support and encourage their focus 
and to deliver much needed savings in the most patient-centered way, by 
improving the quality of care and health outcomes.
  There is tremendous potential for improved care and cost savings in 
five key areas: payment reform, primary and preventive care, measuring 
and reporting quality, administrative simplification, and health 
information technology.
  Savings, from a range of responsible viewpoints, run from $700 
billion to $1 trillion a year, all without compromising the quality of 
care Americans have come to expect--indeed, likely improving the 
quality of care.
  I will shortly release a report to Chairman Harkin and the HELP 
Committee on the Obama administration's implementation of the delivery 
system reform provisions of the affordable care act. When I say 
``delivery system reform,'' I mean those provisions that

[[Page S1960]]

improve the quality of care, avoid medical errors, coordinate care 
better, reward prevention and primary care, reduce administrative 
overhead, and reward who gets the best health outcomes, not who orders 
the most treatment procedures.
  I worked with Senator Mikulski on this project. She authored the key 
delivery provisions of the law and has great expertise in this area.
  These changes will make a real difference for millions of Americans, 
and I look forward to sharing the report and its findings with my 
colleagues next week.
  Before I close, I would like to acknowledge Rhode Island's work on a 
State health insurance exchange provided for by the affordable care 
act. Rhode Island is leading the way as the first State to receive 
level two grant funding to set up the exchange. The exchanges are 
commonsense, local, competitive marketplaces where individuals and 
small businesses will be able to purchase health insurance, with the 
prices and benefits out there on display. When insurance companies 
compete for your business on a transparent, level playing field, it 
will drive down costs. Exchanges will let individuals and small 
businesses use their purchasing power to drive down costs, much like 
big businesses are able to do.
  Progress has been made by State leaders such as our Lieutenant 
Governor Elizabeth Roberts, who is leading this effort to get to this 
point. They are remarkable. I urge them to keep up the good work.
  Whether it is changing the lives of Gregg and Will or Olive or 
Brianne or Geoff and his employees or whether it is building our 
community health center infrastructure or supporting the private sector 
leaders who are pivoting to a new and better and more efficient 
delivery system or whether it is something as simple as a marketplace 
for health insurance that is open, fair, and on the level, the 
affordable care act has made a real difference for hard-working 
families in Rhode Island. I will continue to work hard alongside these 
leading health care providers, alongside the Obama administration, and 
alongside my colleagues in the Congress to see the full promise of the 
affordable care act realized for this great Nation's advantage.
  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 5, 2011, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, it's a great privilege to be here on 
the floor with you. Congratulations to you and the other new Members of 
the Republican Party.
  We have some extraordinarily important tasks ahead of us. This 
afternoon, I'm going to be joined by some of my colleagues. We've just 
heard a very useful discussion on the role of the Constitution and how 
it plays into it. And indeed, today we did spend about 3 hours reading 
through the Constitution, and I think it was to all of our benefit. We 
started off with the new Speaker actually reading the preamble. I think 
that's a good place for us to start, because we're going to discuss 
health care today and we're going to discuss an effort by the majority 
party, the Republicans, to repeal the Affordable Health Care Act that 
was passed last session. And this issue has become a constitutional 
issue, so reading the preamble to the Constitution and Article I, 
section 8 is useful.
  ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect 
Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the 
common defense, promote the general welfare''--promote the general 
welfare--``and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our 
posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States.'' And then later, in article I, section 8, ``Congress shall 
have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to 
pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of 
the United States.''
  It's about the general welfare of the United States that we'll be 
discussing in this next hour, and that's the welfare of the people of 
the United States. It speaks to us, the citizens--all of us--whether we 
are a newborn baby or a senior in the last of life--how do we provide 
for that general welfare?
  Last year, in a major step forward, the first time in more than 
nearly four decades, this Congress, together with the Senate and the 
President, passed the Affordable Health Care Act, a very, very 
important and extremely useful step in providing for the welfare--that 
is, the general welfare--of the American population. It's a law that 
makes life better from birth to retirement. Part of this law, a very, 
very important part of it, deals with what we call the Patient's Bill 
of Rights--the Patient's Bill of Rights, vis-a-vis, the insurance 
industry.
  I think all of us can go back to our districts, to our homes, and 
even to our own lives and find numerous episodes where the insurance 
industry has said, No, you cannot have this procedure; or, No, you 
cannot have coverage because you have a preexisting condition.

                              {time}  1540

  Today, we are going to talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights and 
the Republican effort that is now underway in the Rules Committee in 
this building, as we speak, to write a rule that they will bring to the 
floor next week, without one hearing, to completely wipe out this 
extraordinarily important effort to provide for the general welfare of 
the American people. We are going to discuss that in great detail.
  Now, for me, this is a very important part of my life. I spent 8 
years of my life as the insurance commissioner in California, taking on 
the insurance companies, trying to force them to honor their 
commitments, to force the insurance companies to pay the claim of a 
patient who had undergone chemotherapy, to provide insurance that was 
contracted for and not to rescind that health care policy. I cannot 
even begin to count the number of cases that came before me as 
insurance commissioner where the insurance companies would rescind a 
policy because the person suddenly became ill and had a very expensive 
episode.
  The Patients' Bill of Rights prohibits that. We are going to talk 
about that. I want to start here, and then I'm going to turn this over 
to my colleagues.
  I am going to give an example of a very dear friend who lived here in 
Washington. He was a Peace Corps volunteer, married. He was working 
here in Washington, DC, as the director of the National Peace Corps 
Association, the returned volunteers. He had a child. That child had a 
severe disability--kidneys didn't work. He was insured. His wife was 
insured. The pregnancy was insured. The delivery was insured. But that 
child, on the day the child was born with that preexisting condition of 
kidney failure, was uninsurable under the parents' policy.
  That kind of action is prohibited by the Patients' Bill of Rights. No 
more would that happen to men and women, families, pregnant women 
across this country who deliver babies that have some problem. Those 
babies will be insured whatever the condition might be.
  Our colleagues on the Republican side will bring to this floor next 
Wednesday, without one hearing in any relevant policy committee, a 
repeal of the Patients' Bill of Rights. What of the babies that are 
born in the future that have some issue? How will they be provided for?
  The rest of the story is this family has spent 20 years now 
struggling to provide the health care services that their child needed. 
They have been close to bankruptcy many, many times. They have 
struggled through it. The child is no longer a child--a young adult--
and under the law today, he has health insurance.
  Is that what the American public wants from the Republican Party--the

[[Page H83]]

repeal of that Bill of Rights that guarantees coverage for that young 
man? I think not.
  Let me now turn to our colleague from the great State of Virginia.
  Bobby Scott, would you please share with us your own views and how 
this is going to affect the general welfare of the American people.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Thank you, and I appreciate your hard work. 
Thank you for organizing this Special Order so we can discuss the 
problems with repealing health care.
  You have gone all through the need for health care during your life 
and how the bill provides assistance for those with preexisting 
conditions. It limits insurance company abuses, like what's called a 
``recision,'' when you have paid your premiums all these years and then 
finally get sick, and they want to cancel your policy right when you 
need it. There are lifetime and annual limits on benefits where they 
pay a certain amount, and once they get to that, you can be in the 
middle of a treatment, and they're not going to pay another dime for 
the rest of your life or at least for the rest of that year. There are 
many people with chronic diseases who hit up upon these limits very 
frequently.
  You have talked about young people on their parents' policies, who 
are working, who finally get jobs. They don't cover benefits. Up to 26 
years old, they can stay on their parents' policies.
  We have talked about prevention, the importance of prevention. A lot 
of people, because of copayments and deductibles, can't afford their 
annual checkups. This bill provides for annual checkups without 
copayments and deductibles.
  For those senior citizens in the doughnut hole, where they get no 
benefits, adding insult to injury, they have to continue paying their 
premiums, and get no benefit. We have assistance for them.
  It is outrageous that they would elect to try to repeal this. No 
hearings. No nothing. Just put a label on it and call it ``ObamaCare'' 
and then expect people to go along with the repeal. You just can't 
label things and expect people, by virtue of the label, to take action. 
They call it ``government-run health care.'' No. Government-run health 
care was the single-payer plan. That was defeated.

  The option of a public option would have been nice. People talk about 
choice. Well, in the plan that's on the books today, they have the 
choice of all the plans of anybody who wants to sell insurance in their 
States. They have a choice of all of them. It would be nice to have an 
additional choice--a choice of a public option where you have the 
choice of a policy that is not run by a for-profit corporation with a 
financial interest in denying you coverage or canceling your policy. It 
would be nice to have that option. You don't have to pick it, but it's 
just nice to have that option.
  One of the things that we want to make sure is that we have as many 
options as possible, including a public option if we can ever get 
there; but when we talk about repeal and replace, there is no replace 
tomorrow in the rule that they are suggesting. They just want it 
repealed. We want to know what they're going to replace it with and 
what they're going to leave out.
  Are they going to leave out the part where people with preexisting 
conditions can get covered? Are they going to say, ``No, you can't get 
covered''? Does the insurance company get to decide who has the 
privilege? Are health insurance companies going to tell young people 
under 26 to get off their parents' policies? Are they going to tell 
those in the doughnut hole to get back in the doughnut hole where they 
belong? Are they going to talk about those who can't afford prevention 
to get prevention? Are they going to tell those who are going to run 
out of coverage because of the limits, ``No, that's enough. You've had 
enough, and you can't get any more coverage''?
  What are they going to tell all of these people?
  We need to make sure that we keep this policy, all of these 
provisions, intact. I have no idea what they want to replace it with, 
but I think, if they went step by step and if the people looked at the 
provisions of the bill, they would elect to keep everything that's in 
the bill today.
  Now, there are some things that people don't like. When you have a 
good plan, you have to pay for it. Unfortunately, they're not paying 
for it. We were fiscally responsible. When we passed it, we were under 
PAYGO. They've repealed a lot of that so that they can go trillions of 
dollars in the ditch without paying for it. We paid for it. In fact, 
the CBO originally said that the first 10 years of the program would 
reduce the deficit by $140 billion. Now the estimate is $200-some 
billion in the next 10 years. So it is fiscally responsible.
  There are things we can do better together than everybody out for 
their own. We need to oppose the repeal of this health care to make 
sure that people have the protections and the Patients' Bill of Rights 
that they have under this legislation.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you very much.
  You've raised about seven of the major issues that are involved in 
this repeal that the Republicans will bring to this floor next 
Wednesday without one hearing in any relevant policy committee, a 
repeal that will affect every single American--that will affect their 
well-being, their health, their ability to get health insurance, and 
their ability to stay healthy.

                              {time}  1550

  So we have an enormous issue before us and we want the American 
public to be aware of what's going on here. It is the repeal of the 
Patient's Bill of Rights.
  Let me move on to one of our other colleagues from Tennessee. Mr. 
Steven Cohen, if you will join us, please.
  Mr. COHEN. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to share with you, 
and I want to first start because this day has been a day that started 
with the reading of the Constitution which is a document that we all 
revere. I have a little pocket copy of it right here, and we revere it. 
We pledge when we take our oath of office to protect and defend and 
support the Constitution, but we all know that it's interpreted by our 
Supreme Court, and it's Supreme Court history would have been better 
today for people to understand.
  And you mention that the foundation of the particular health care 
bill is in the preamble: We, the people of the United States, to form a 
more perfect union, establish justice, et cetera, promote the general 
welfare.
  Also, in article I, which is the legislative article, section 8, it 
says that the Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce among 
the several States; and further, it says in article I that the Congress 
shall have the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and 
proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other 
powers vested by this Constitution of the Government of the United 
States, in either Department or office thereof. So, in my opinion--I'm 
a lawyer, but there's lawyers on both sides--there's plenty of 
justification for this health care bill.
  Do you know next week when the Republicans will try to repeal this 
opportunity for Americans to get health care and wipe out these pre-
existing conditions clauses, et cetera, will they be coming under the 
idea that health care is not part of the general welfare? Will they be 
coming basically on a constitutional argument that they may make that 
this wasn't allowed to require a person to buy insurance even though we 
can, of course, require a person to sign up for the draft and lose 
their liberty for a while and serve in the Army--and we can do that, we 
can conscript soldiers, but we can't make them buy insurance. Is that 
what they're going to say, or are they going to come and talk about 
these things that Mr. Scott talked about and say that we don't think 
it's good policy for parents to have their children on their insurance 
until they're 26 or it's not good policy for women with breast cancer 
to get treatment at a certain amount? What are their tactics?
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, I would assume that they will try to go into 
their interpretation of the Constitution and avoid the very difficult 
argument of forcing or eliminating the Patient's Bill of Rights and 
allowing the insurance companies to engage in gross discrimination 
based upon sex. Clearly, women are discriminated against by the health 
insurance companies unless the Patient's Bill of Rights is there to 
protect them. Similarly, the two examples that you gave, pre-existing 
conditions, I cannot imagine that they

[[Page H84]]

would even attempt to successfully or even would be unsuccessful to 
argue that somehow these protections for the individual are not worth 
having.
  I think they will go into some obscure interpretation of the 
Constitution. We'll see. There's going to be a debate on the floor. 
Unfortunately, there will be no hearings to precede that, and there 
will not be a discussion of the details.
  Mr. COHEN. And they will control the amendments that will be 
permitted to be discussed on this floor. I know Speaker Boehner said we 
were going to be able to have amendments and be able to have good 
discourse.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. As you know--I saw you in Rules Committee earlier 
today--it is my impression that the Rules Committee is going to 
prohibit any amendments on the floor. We'll see. I mean, that has yet 
to be decided by the Rules Committee. We don't know, but surely the one 
amendment I would propose is: don't do it, maintain the Patient's Bill 
of Rights, maintain these protections that we all need.
  There's not a person in this Nation that is not subject to the 
possibility of an incident that would become a reason for rescission. 
That's my experience. Eight years hammering the insurance industry, you 
have got to honor your contract. Yet because of the laws, they were 
able to wiggle out of an expensive incident.
  Mr. COHEN. When I was a child, I had polio when I was 5 years old in 
1954. I was fortunate. My father was a doctor, and so sometimes 
professional courtesy, but I'm sure he had insurance that covered my 
hospitalization. But there were years later, I think it was 11 years 
later I had a tendon-lengthening operation that was immediately related 
to my polio and necessary on my Achilles tendon. That wouldn't have 
been permitted necessarily if they could use the pre-existing condition 
such as polio to have denied coverage; and whether or not how my father 
dealt with the expense and whether it's because he was a physician, I 
don't know; but I'd hate to see children in the same situation and 
parents in the same situation not be permitted to get that type of 
coverage later on.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. I don't know if you were a Member of Congress at the 
time, but we all under this law would have the same policy that every 
American would have. We wouldn't have any different policy than the 
American public would have, and the question about rescission, and 
you're a prime candidate should you lose office, which you shouldn't, 
to be uninsurable if the Patient's Bill of Rights were repealed.
  Under the Patient's Bill of Rights, if you were to leave Congress, 
you could get an insurance policy because the pre-existing condition 
that you have, polio, and an operation resulting from the polio would 
go into play as a pre-existing condition, and you would not be able to 
get an insurance policy.
  Mr. COHEN. Let me, if I can, read something that I've had prepared 
for today that came from a constituent's story, John Hopkins; and I 
know John Hopkins. He's a very important and active member in 
my community and contemporary. He sent me an email, and Mr. Hopkins 
requests I share this story with the House as we consider repeal of the 
Affordable Care Act. I want to share it with everybody here on C-SPAN.

  John was diagnosed with two unrelated cancers during his life. If you 
know anything about cancer, getting it twice for unrelated reasons is 
almost unheard of, but it happened to John Hopkins. Midway through his 
first bout with cancer, he was, of course, dropped from his health 
insurance plan. He was left with a medical bill that wiped out his and 
his wife's entire retirement savings, as well as the value of their 
house. They were never able to repay the debt in their lifetime. When 
he was diagnosed with a second bout of cancer 2 years later, he had no 
health insurance because there was no insurer anywhere in the market 
who would offer him a policy because of the pre-existing condition.
  He got some coverage in Tennessee because of a plan called Access 
Tennessee for uninsurables, but it was limited to $250,000 a year. As 
we all know, annual limits are set to be phased out by 2014 because of 
this law, and lifetime limits are already a thing of the past. A 
quarter of a million dollars may seem like a lot of coverage; but when 
somebody needs something like a bone marrow transplant to cure their 
leukemia, that single treatment would exceed the annual cap.
  My Republican colleagues have decided their first priority as the new 
majority will be repealing the Affordable Care Act; and when they vote 
to do this, they will be voting for the following: denying Mr. Hopkins 
the ability to enroll in a health insurance plan that doesn't 
discriminate against him for daring to be diagnosed with cancer again. 
They will deny John Hopkins the ability to enroll in a health plan that 
will actually continue to cover his treatment after he exhausts the 
current annual cap of $250,000, an amount that many cancer patients 
meet in a matter of weeks upon diagnosis, let alone those who are 
fighting two cancers over a number of years.
  And it will send a message to John Hopkins and every other single 
American who has ever been diagnosed or will ever be diagnosed with a 
disease like cancer that they're on their own when it comes to 
coverage, that sure they're free to get treatments and meet with their 
doctors, undergo laborious and life-saving surgeries year after year, 
just so long as they can foot the bill or try to keep it under the 
annual cap, because when it comes to cancer, budgeting your treatment 
should surely take precedence over anything else. Right?
  Mr. Garamendi, I am ashamed that we are considering repeal of this 
affordable health care bill; and when I see these numbers about 
$250,000 and I think of the fact that the Republicans were against any 
caps on taxes, they realize $250,000 annual income in many places is a 
middle-income salary, but for limitations on health care, they think 
the insurance company should determine that and that's enough; and if 
you have got cancer, it's not enough.
  Another friend of mine Facebooked me, Jimmy Barrasso. Jimmy worked 
for a long time for a company in Memphis. He's always been successful. 
He lost his job with that corporation. Because he had high cholesterol, 
he had difficulties getting insurance, and it took him a long time to 
find private insurance because of that pre-existing condition. He just 
sent me this on Facebook. He was friending me and he mentioned it, and 
I wanted to relate it.
  There are so many people in this country who are getting benefits and 
will get benefits and many of the benefits don't go into effect until 
2014, and the idea that this Congress, the 112th, as its first act 
would do such harm to the general welfare of the American public is 
hard to fathom.

                              {time}  1600

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Cohen, thank you so very much. Your closing 
sentence needs to be repeated. That the very first piece of legislation 
taken up by the new Republican majority in the 112th Congress is to 
repeal the Patients Bill of Rights. It's unfathomable.
  Let me now call on Frank Pallone, our colleague from the great State 
of--yes, it is--New Jersey.
  Mr. PALLONE. Well, first of all, let me thank you, my colleague from 
California, and each of the other speakers here for the contribution 
they have made tonight, and particularly when I listened to my 
colleague from Tennessee talk about those particular cases of 
individuals that were impacted, because that's really what this is all 
about.
  Again, it is amazing to me that the first act of this new Republican 
majority is to try to repeal a bill, health care reform, that really is 
making a difference for people on a personal level, particularly with 
the patient protections.
  You know, I thought to myself when I was coming down here: Who 
benefits from repeal? Who could possibly benefit from repeal? Because, 
as many of you talked about, all the people who are going to be harmed 
by it, who would benefit from it? And the only group I could think of 
that would benefit from the repeal are the big insurance companies 
because, if you think about it, what do they want to do? They want to 
keep increasing premiums. I read that in your State--I don't know, you 
may have already mentioned it--Blue Cross/Blue Shield, whatever, is 
talking about a 50-something percent increase. I cannot fathom these 
double-digit increases.
  And, of course, as this health care reform kicks in, it's going to be 
more and

[[Page H85]]

more difficult for the types of increases that we've seen in premiums 
that these big health insurance companies have put forward. And the 
reason the insurance companies want to get rid of the Patients' Bill of 
Rights and reinstitute all of these discriminatory practices, whether 
it be denying care because of preexisting conditions or reinstituting 
lifetime caps or, you know, the different protections that we've seen 
kick in, the reason they want to do that is also money-oriented. In 
other words, they have to pay out money. You talked about the cancer 
person.
  I was up at the Rules Committee earlier, and Ms. Slaughter was 
talking about someone who had cancer and was treated and ran into the 
lifetime cap, and then the cancer reoccurred and she didn't have any 
more coverage because she had hit the lifetime cap. And that's a 
perfect example. They want to have lifetime caps. They want to have 
annual caps. They don't want preexisting conditions. They don't want 
your kids on your policy because it saves them money. The way that they 
make profits and pay dividends to their shareholders is by raising 
premiums and having discriminatory practices that eliminate the people 
that cost money because they need health care. I mean, it's that 
simple.
  And already, and just in the last few weeks, provisions have kicked 
in that go against that. The President announced--or the White House 
announced, I think around Christmastime, new regulations that say that 
any premium increase that's over 10 percent will be scrutinized. And 
under the provisions of this bill and the new regulations, these 
increases are not allowed to go above 10 percent. On January 1, the 
provisions kicked in that said that 80 percent of your premium costs 
had to be used for benefits, couldn't be used for insurance company 
profits, couldn't be used to pay back dividends to the shareholders. So 
all of these initiatives that are already kicking in, they basically 
make it more difficult for the insurance companies to make a big 
profit, and the consequence of that is that health insurance becomes 
more affordable.
  I was up at the Rules Committee earlier. It was interesting because, 
I think you mentioned, my colleague from California, or one of you 
mentioned that we, under this bill, under the health care reform that's 
in place now that they want to repeal, we get the same health 
insurance, as Congressmen, as any other American.
  You know, I still have people write to me and say, well, you know, 
You have your own policy, but you want to give me this lousy coverage 
that I'm going to get under the health care reform. And I have to write 
back and say, No, that's not true. You may hear that on some TV station 
or something, but it's simply not true.
  We specifically wrote into the bill that we have to go into the 
exchanges just like everybody else. We are going to be different from 
other Federal employees, as Congressmen, because we go into the 
exchanges.
  So, at the Rules Committee today, one of the Republican Members who 
is very supportive of repeal said that he specifically wasn't going to 
take health insurance as a Congressman, and he wanted me to know that 
because he was voting for repeal. And I said, Well, that's very nice 
and that's commendable for you, but I, frankly, think that every Member 
of Congress who votes for repeal should say, I don't want health 
insurance from the Federal Government, because if you are going to deny 
it to everyone else, you should deny it to yourself. Just the way we're 
saying that we are going to get the same coverage as everyone else, 
well, if you don't want anyone else to have the coverage, then you 
shouldn't get it yourself.
  And I know that some Members have already taken issue. There was one 
Member from Maryland who came to the orientation, a Republican Member 
from Maryland who apparently was a big advocate for repeal. And he said 
that he was inquiring because his Federal health insurance didn't take 
effect, as a Congressman, until February 1. We were sworn in yesterday, 
but I guess it takes 30 days before the insurance actually kicks in. He 
was complaining about the fact that had he to wait until February 1 to 
get his health insurance, as a Congressman. Well, you know, again, if 
you're going to vote for repeal next week, you shouldn't be worried 
about when it's going to kick in. You shouldn't be taking it at all, in 
my opinion.
  So there is a lot of--I don't know what the phrase is--smoke and 
mirrors or whatever the word is that is going on around here on the 
other side of the aisle in how they are viewing this. And my point is, 
you know, there is a lot of protection here for people. Don't deny them 
that unless you're going to deny it to yourself. But more than that, 
think about who is helped by this repeal--only the big insurance 
companies. They are the only ones that are going to benefit.

  I know you were the insurance commissioner, and so you know exactly 
what I'm talking about.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. I do have some experience on that. I wanted to deal 
with that. It's called the medical loss ratio, and the insurance 
companies have cut a fat check for themselves over the years by taking 
a big premium and then paying a very small amount of it out for the 
medical coverages.
  In this legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights, and in the 
Affordable Health Care Act, they can't do that. They've got to pay, for 
the individual policies, 80 percent and, for the group policies, 85 
percent for medical services.
  So what was the very first thing they did after this bill was signed 
into law? We passed it last year, and the President signed it. The very 
first thing they did was to run down to the Health and Human Services 
Department and say, Oh, but our advertising ought to be included as a 
medical expense, and, Oh, these expenses for these kinds of employees, 
mostly statisticians and the like, that's a medical expense. 
Fortunately, the administration said, No, we think not.
  So what we're trying to do with this legislation is make sure that 
when we pay a dollar, at least we get 80 cents back in medical 
services. Our friends on the other side would repeal that and allow the 
insurance companies to take that money--or at least a larger portion of 
that money--put it in their pockets, give it to their CEOs, whatever, 
but not use it for medical services. Medical loss ratio is really 
important.
  And the other thing you mentioned needs to be understood also, and 
that is the ability of the governments to review, not to say ``no,'' 
but to shine that big, bright spotlight onto the insurance company 
premium increases. Is it justified? Yes? No? What are your costs and so 
forth? What ratios are you using in medical losses and the like? So 
that spotlight of information is required under the law. Many, many 
things in the law.
  Mr. Cohen, I see you stood up, anxious to make a comment here, so 
please do. And then I notice behind you our colleague from Maryland has 
joined us. And eventually, I want to start talking about seniors. So 
please, Mr. Cohen, go forth.
  Mr. COHEN. I wanted to ask you a question. Because I had said, and I 
was, I think, incorrect, when I suggested that the first thing the 
Republicans wanted to do was repeal the affordable health care bill. 
It's one of their first major priorities. But the first thing they did 
was today, and we joined with them. It was bipartisan. It was to cut 5 
percent from our Members' representational allowances, a small amount 
of money in the big picture, of course. But the deficit was the issue 
that they were highlighting.
  What would the repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act do to the 
deficit? That's the big issue, because that's one of our big issues.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, Mr. Cohen, it just happens that we prepared this 
little blue chart here. Actually, it probably ought to be in the red. 
The repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act obviously deals with the 
Patients' Bill of Rights, but it also deals with the deficit.

                              {time}  1610

  This week, the Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, not 
Democrat, not Republican, they answer to neither party. They answer to 
the general public. They said that the repeal of the Affordable Health 
Care Act will increase the deficit by $230 billion, $230 billion in the 
next 9 years, and in the out years, the next 10 years, well over 1 
trillion, $200 billion increase in the deficit.

[[Page H86]]

  Mr. COHEN. And that's money we owe China; is that right? So it's okay 
to issue these securities and pay the Chinese the interest to be able 
to finance it, and our children and their grandchildren will be paying 
this if they don't have preexisting conditions where they can get 
insurance to cover the illnesses they may have to stay alive to pay 
these taxes.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Our children, grandchildren, and indeed those of us 
that are living for another 10 .."

                         AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, 435 Members of the House of 
Representatives spent the last 10 days back in their districts. I 
suspect, like me, they had a chance to meet with their constituents to 
talk about the issues of the day and to see America's real progress, 
the progress that is taking place in our communities.
  I would like to share some of those experiences that I had over the 
last 10 days with the Members of this House because they are 
instructive about what we ought to be doing here in the House of 
Representatives.
  Every person I talk to, probably more than 30 meetings, many of them 
public in nature, townhall meetings, meetings at manufacturing plants 
with the workers, meetings at the universities, all of those people had 
the same agenda. Frankly, it ought to be our agenda because it is 
America's agenda.
  They want this economy to grow. They want this economy to provide the 
job opportunities that Americans must have. Those good hardworking 
American families, they want to go to work, they want to have a decent 
wage, and they want to be certain that when they are sick they have an 
affordable health care policy.
  We hear a lot of rhetoric here about the Affordable Care Act and 
ObamaCare, but back home people are trying to figure out their 
insurance programs, just like they do every time at this time of year. 
Every year it is time to renew your insurance policy and people look at 
new policies. They put aside the old policy. They get a notice that 
their old policy, the cost has gone up or the coverage has changed.
  Now they are in the same situation, but we have a name for it now. We 
call it ObamaCare. Americans always in the fall have a high level of 
confusion as they try to figure out what to do with their health care 
for the coming year.
  At one meeting I attended this last week with a group of doctors and 
administrators, they said: This will work it out, this is no different 
than we have seen every year. We know that at the end of this process 
the health care insurance will go on and people will have coverage. 
Then they added: But this year, there will be far more people with 
health care coverage, and in our hospital there will not be as much 
uncompensated care, that is, people that don't have insurance. So they 
said: Just keep working at it, let this thing settle down, let it go 
forward because we know that in California millions of our citizens and 
our neighbors will finally have health care insurance.
  But hey, this is a place of rhetoric, this is a place where we create 
problems like the new crisis that is going to come up in just 2\1/2\ 
months. Oh yeah,

[[Page H6981]]

we have manufactured yet another crisis. On January 15, we are going to 
have to go through our quarterly funding of the strongest government in 
the entire world. Hello, you said. You mean you are actually funding 
the United States Government once every 3 months? You don't have a full 
year funding? That's right, we don't. So we have yet one more 
manufactured crisis.
  Be aware, January 15 is coming. Is there another government shutdown? 
The American people, my constituents in my district, said: Don't let it 
happen again, don't let it happen again. It hurt us, it hurt us. In our 
businesses, we had to lay off people. But Mr. Congressman, what we want 
is a steady, steady policy out of Washington. We want to know what the 
long-term looks like. We want to know what the long-term tax policy is. 
We want to know what the funding programs are going to be for the 
military, for the social welfare programs. We don't want to have to--as 
one constituent told me as I visited their Head Start program--we don't 
want to have to lay people off, we don't want to have to tell the 
children, the 600 in my district that are no longer in the Head Start 
program: Oh, I am sorry, you can't come to school next week because 
funding from Washington was cut.

                              {time}  1930

  It is time for us in the House of Representatives to settle down. It 
is time for us to put aside all of our rhetoric. We know we have to 
work together. It is time for us to come up with some long-term 
solutions for America's problems. Tonight I would like to talk about 
how we can build jobs here in the United States, how we can rebuild the 
manufacturing sector of the United States economy, a sector of the 
economy that just 15 years ago employed just under 20 million Americans 
with solid jobs, where the wife or the husband could go to work each 
day knowing that they would bring home a paycheck sufficient to pay the 
mortgage on the house, to buy a car, and they had a health insurance 
policy provided by their employer. Now, we are somewhere near 11 
million Americans in manufacturing, and many of those health insurance 
programs have disappeared.
  What we need to do is go back to the basics. We need to go back to 
those critical investments, both public and private, that have created 
this incredible economy. Even though manufacturing is smaller, 
nonetheless the economy of the United States remains the biggest in the 
world. But if we continue with this 3-month funding of the Federal 
Government, if we continue to withdraw the critical public investments 
and the critical inducements to the private sector to make their 
investments, we will see our economy slip away. We will see the 
strength of this Nation ebb, and we will wonder down the line what 
happened.
  Well, there are several things that allow America to build these 
kinds of things. That's a modern locomotive, an electric locomotive 
destined to be on the Amtrak lines here on the east coast. It was the 
first modern locomotive made in America, 100 percent American made in 
probably the last 60-70 years. How did it come to pass that this 
locomotive and about 77 other locomotives just like it will be on the 
tracks here on the east coast, 100 percent American made? How did that 
happen?
  Well, it happened with government policy. And so the men and women 
and children who ride the trains here on the eastern corridor are going 
to have a new system available to them. Critical investments were made 
over the years, critical investments in each one of these issues, and 
these are the ways in each of these areas, in international trade, in 
tax policy, in energy policy, labor relations issues, education, 
research, and infrastructure. Oh, by the way, none of this is new. 
These are not new things. These have been in place in America since 
George Washington's time. Indeed, George Washington reached out to 
Alexander Hamilton shortly after he was inaugurated as the first 
President of the United States, and said, Hey, Alex, I need some help 
here. I want to build the American economy, Alex, so what can we do?
  Well, Alexander Hamilton said, Let me work on it.
  He came back about 2 months later with a report. Our reports are 
usually 2,000 or 3,000 pages. His was maybe less than 50. He said there 
are things that we can do at the Federal level to grow the American 
economy, to build the manufacturing sector of America. He called it 
manufacturers, and he said trade policy. We need a trade policy that 
protects American manufacturers against cheap imports coming into the 
United States, against those who would subsidize their businesses to 
the detriment of American businesses. He said trade policy. We need a 
trade policy that protects American manufacturing.
  That was Alexander Hamilton in his report to George Washington in the 
first months of the first administration of the United States 
Government.
  Tax policy was also there. He said that in tax policy we shouldn't be 
taxing ours, our manufacturing products. We should be taxing those 
products that are coming from overseas. Those are called duties, and so 
tax policy was part of it.
  Actually, energy policy wasn't on the list at the time so we can kind 
of put that aside, although that is an extremely important discussion 
for today; but for the purposes of today, we will let that go.
  Labor at the time was not such a good thing. There were no laws 
protecting the men and women who worked, and certainly there was 
slavery and all the horrible things that went with that; but labor 
policy was also not part of what he talked about.
  But he did talk about education. This was probably a conversation 
that I'm not sure Hamilton and Jefferson had, but education was very 
much a part of the early effort in the American Government to stimulate 
economic growth, manufacturing and the like.
  Interestingly, research wasn't specifically called out; but while 
they didn't use the term ``research,'' they used the word ``patent,'' 
``patents,'' and ``patent policy'' which was also part of this report. 
While they didn't say ``research'' formally, what they did say was out 
of the innovative and inventive mind of Americans would come new ideas 
and there needed to be a patent policy to allow those new ideas to 
mature and inure to the benefit of the inventor and the entrepreneur.
  So way back at the very beginning of this Nation's economic future, 
certain policies were laid in place that actually led to the 
extraordinary growth in infrastructure. Hamilton specifically said, and 
George Washington agreed, that there needed to be a transportation 
policy for the United States. We are calling that infrastructure today. 
Then they called it canals, ports, roads. Today we call it canals, 
ports, roads, airports, we call it Internet, we call it 
telecommunication systems. It is the infrastructure upon which the 
economy then grows.
  Way back in the 1780s, these ideas were presented to the Congress of 
the United States, some of them enacted by the Congress, some of them 
enacted by the various State governments. And over the years, as 
generations have gone by, as new men and women have come to sit here in 
the Halls of this great Congress and in the Senate, and new Presidents, 
there has been a constant drumbeat of critical investment by the United 
States Government in the foundation of economic growth.
  And today, in the debates that are occurring here on the floor of 
this House and across this Nation, there is a debate about the role of 
the Federal Government in the future economy of the United States. You 
just heard part of that debate from some of my colleagues who preceded 
me here on the floor saying that the United States Government really 
ought not be involved in health care too much. Okay, they didn't like 
the Affordable Care Act. They want it to disappear, repealed, defunded 
or otherwise gone. Well, okay. But there is this thing called Medicare. 
I don't hear anybody on the floor saying--well, they actually did call 
for the repeal of Medicare, but that hasn't gone very far.

  But the Federal Government is involved in many, many aspects of 
American life; and in those things that create economic growth, you 
will find us now involved soon in a debate about trade policy. Should 
we have unlimited free trade in which the American businesses are open 
to unfair competition from around the world, from workers that are paid 
virtually nothing in some of the less developed countries of the world 
where there are no laws about working conditions, where factories

[[Page H6982]]

collapse? Should American businesses have to compete with that kind of 
competition? I think not. So I would use the words ``fair trade,'' not 
free trade, but fair trade--trade policies that are fair to the 
American worker, that give the American worker a chance to compete in 
the world markets rather than having our business simply run away 
chasing the cheapest wage rate in the world.
  So trade policy is going to be discussed here with the Trans-Pacific 
partnership program and perhaps a similar one for Europe. We must be 
very careful, very, very careful as we analyze this that the American 
worker is not put in a disadvantageous position and situation where 
they will lose their job to competition, unfair competition from around 
the world. So it has to be fair trade.
  Let me move down here to the infrastructure issue. My district is 200 
miles of the Sacramento River Valley. I probably have 1,000 miles of 
levees that protect farms and ranches and cities from floods. We have 
had disastrous floods in California over the years and over the 
centuries. Those levees are critical, a critical infrastructure to 
protect not only human life and property, but to allow businesses to 
grow. Right now without proper levees, farmers who want to put in a 
feed mill, farmers in my district who grow rice who want to put in a 
rice drying facility and a silo in which to store that rice, or even a 
cow barn for their dairy, find it difficult and in many cases 
impossible because the levee that holds back the floodwaters from their 
farm does not meet the 100-year flood standard set by the Corps of 
Engineers and FEMA. Therefore, they can't build unless they get 
insurance, and the insurance program is unaffordable.
  So we see right here that the growth in the agricultural sector in my 
district is retarded from lack of investment in the levees, upgrading 
and maintaining those levees so they meet the minimum standards. This 
is something the Federal Government has played a role in forever, it 
seems. Certainly for the last century and a half, the Federal 
Government has been involved through the Army Corps of Engineers in 
building levees to protect cities, whether it is on the Ohio River, the 
Mississippi, the Missouri, or in California, the Sacramento and the San 
Joaquin Rivers in that central valley and beyond.
  So what are we doing today? Well, we passed a Water Resources 
Development Act a couple of weeks ago. Good for us. The Senate has 
passed their bill. We need a conference committee. I understand the 
Senate has named conferees. The House of Representatives has yet to do 
so. All of that is good. We will set out a good policy, I hope, one 
that sets proper controls, provides for prioritization, a policy that 
would make sure that there is no waste, fraud and abuse, and that 
efficient and effective policies are the ones that would be funded by 
the American taxpayer. All good. But there is a problem. The problem 
is, where is the money to pay for this? It is not there. Why? 
Sequestration and severe budget cuts.
  We are actually seeing a very rapid decline in the amount of money 
that is available for infrastructure investment and for other programs 
that the Federal Government has carried out over many, many decades.
  So we can put the best policies in place; but unless we have the 
money to build these structures, then those farmers that want to 
improve their operation are not going to be able to do so. So we ought 
to think seriously about infrastructure investment, in this case 
protection for floods. The same thing goes for the cities in my 
district and across this Nation. We know there is a big brouhaha going 
on around here about the increasing cost of flood insurance. Yes, it is 
a real problem: like quadruple, in some cases there is a ten-fold, 
increase in the cost of flood insurance in certain communities around 
the Nation. Everybody goes, We didn't mean to do that. Indeed, we 
didn't mean to do that; but it did happen. Now we have to back that 
off. As we back that off, we need to consider the fact that it is not 
just flood insurance; it is the protection from floods.
  And so when Superstorm Sandy comes again, will the east coast be 
prepared with the necessary flood walls and facilities to repel the 
flood? Only if we adequately finance the infrastructure investment in 
this case for flood protection.
  Highways and bridges, well, I don't know, there is probably several 
thousand bridges in the United States that you want to cross very 
quickly, or you don't want to be on that bridge with a very heavy 
truck. We have deficient bridges in every part of the United States. We 
have seen those bridges collapse with catastrophic results, people 
losing their lives, cars into the rivers, trucks into the rivers. These 
bridges have to be repaired. And drive on any highway in the United 
States, you will see some new asphalt, some new concrete, but you are 
going to see a whole lot more new potholes. You are going to see the 
deterioration of the highway system in the United States. There is 
insufficient money even to maintain the repair and good state of those 
highways. It goes on and on.

                              {time}  1945

  Where will we find the revenue? We are continuing to see a decline in 
the willingness of the Federal Government, us, Members of Congress, to 
fund these programs.
  Infrastructure, critically important in many ways, and I have only 
dealt with two of those issues here tonight.
  I want to pick up the one that is really the genesis of economic 
growth, and it is research. I mentioned earlier that George Washington, 
while he didn't use the word ``research,'' used the word ``patent,'' 
which comes from research being done by some individual or group that 
created a new product. They got their patent on it so that they could 
then use that in the commercial marketplace and hopefully make a 
profit.
  Research has been around a long time. Most of the research in the 
early days was probably mostly in the area of the military, done in 
part by the military, dating way back, in trying to upgrade their 
weapons. But beginning in the 1860s, Abraham Lincoln signed a law 
called the land-grant college program and established, across the 
United States, a series of colleges and universities who had a specific 
function of researching for agriculture.
  Over the years, that has grown into an extraordinary research 
capability within the United States. And now, not only do we have the 
agricultural research--and I must say, with some pride, that I 
represent the University of California, Davis, which is the largest, 
most successful, most advanced in total--I am not putting down anybody 
else--agricultural research program in the world. There are a lot of 
other great programs out there, but in terms of size and reach, the 
University of California, Davis is way out front.
  What other kinds of research are there funded by the United States 
Government? The National Institutes of Health. How do we keep people 
healthy? What about disease? What about heart conditions, cancer? The 
National Institutes of Health; the National Science Foundation; NOAA, 
dealing with oceans and atmosphere; NASA, dealing with space. All of 
these research projects are fundamental to economic growth, and all of 
them have Federal funding. Some of them have partnerships with State, 
some with private funding, but these partnerships have created the 
foundation for economic growth.
  I had the pleasure of being at the University of California, Davis 
earlier this last week, meeting with the heads of four departments, 
each of them engaged in a different kind of research--earth science 
research in some cases, water research in others. Everybody knows that 
California has its water issues, and right now we are in the early 
stages of what I hope and pray is not a drought.
  We have these researchers out there and other research on health 
issues. All of them are saying that the sequestration and the budget 
cuts of the Federal Government are severely impacting critical research 
that was about to mature into a solution for a health problem, into a 
new way of conserving water or a new energy system using hydrogen or 
solar. But those projects that they were working on have been stalled 
and, in some cases, set aside, so the opportunity for economic growth 
coming from that research is slowed or stopped. We can't allow that to 
happen. Not only is it immediate jobs, but that is the research that 
will create future jobs.

[[Page H6983]]

  I want to give one example of the way in which research actually 
works out together with regulations, regulations to protect our air, 
regulations to protect our water--the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water 
Act, and other regulations. Some of them are now dealing with the issue 
of climate change.
  I am a member of the Safe Climate Caucus, and there are many of us 
that belong to this caucus. We are trying to say we have got global 
warming. Whether the tragic typhoon in the Philippines was directly 
caused by global warming--I think it is no accident that we are seeing 
stronger storms just as predicted. Anyway, our Safe Climate Caucus is 
concerned that many here in Congress are trying to shut down 
commonsense Environmental Protection Agency guidelines that are 
designed to keep our air and our water clean and healthy and to reduce 
the disastrous consequences of climate change.
  These regulations can actually drive technological development and 
they can strengthen our economy. When those policies are paired with 
the entrepreneurship, the inventiveness of the individuals and 
businesses out there, some really interesting things happen and jobs 
are created.
  Last week I visited one such program in California. It is a program 
put together by Recology, which is a company that operates in my 
district and in San Francisco. They are a recycling, a composting, and 
a landfill company, and they have a landfill. They are involved in some 
very interesting and innovative ways to separate the waste, to recycle, 
all to the good.
  But they have another project. They have teamed up with a company 
called G2 Energy. It has put in place a facility to take the methane 
gas that comes off of the landfill that at one point went up in the 
atmosphere--do keep in mind that methane gas is around a 20 times more 
potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. They put in a project to 
capture that methane gas, take it out of the landfill, put it in a pipe 
with a vacuum, run it over to a Caterpillar engine manufactured in 
America--actually, it is a big marine engine that probably was driving 
some very large ship, but it now is sitting there next to the landfill, 
attached to a generator, and producing an extraordinary amount of 
electricity.
  That is innovation, and that is the kind of things that can be done. 
That methane coming off the landfill into the Caterpillar engine and 
into the generator will replace more than a million gallons of diesel 
fuel that was once used to run that very same kind of an engine. That 
is the kind of innovation that can occur when coupled with research and 
wise public policy.
  There are so many other pieces to all of this, and we will talk about 
it in the days ahead.
  One of the things that I want to just kind wind up with is why it is 
important. So, do keep in mind trade policy, tax policy, energy, labor 
policy, education, research, and infrastructure. These are the 
foundational investments that any economy must make if they want to see 
sustained economic growth. Unfortunately, we are falling off the power 
curve on many of these policies.

  Here is why it is important. Here is why this discussion is 
important. Here is why manufacturing and growth in the American economy 
is important. These are words that Franklin Delano Roosevelt put 
forward. He said:

       The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the 
     abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide 
     enough for those who have too little.

  We know that after the great meltdown in 2008 and 2009 that millions 
of Americans lost their jobs. We also know that, in the last 5 years, 
the economy has come back, that additional wealth has been created. We 
do know that the gross national product of the United States, which is 
its wealth, has grown. What most people don't know is where that wealth 
went. That wealth went to the top 10 percent. About 95 percent of the 
wealth generated over the last 5 years has wound up in the hands of the 
top 10 percent, the most wealthy people in America.
  So the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt come directly back to a 
manufacturing and jobs policy for the United States. If we make the 
critical investments to grow the economy, to provide the 
infrastructure, to do the research, to deal with the international 
trade, to think back to what George Washington had in mind as a 
Founding Father, then we can begin to establish policies that grow the 
American economy, that reestablish America as the mightiest 
manufacturing country in the world, and, in so doing, create those jobs 
for hardworking Americans that go to work every day, want to pay their 
bills, want to pay their house mortgage, buy the car, see that their 
kids get an education, see that they have an adequate health insurance 
program. If we do those things, then these words of Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt will begin to ring true, and we will begin to add enough for 
those who, today, have too little. That should be our challenge.
  It is not our place to make sure that the superwealthy and the 
billionaires and others get even more. It is our place that those who 
struggle every day, many in poverty--and the poverty rate in California 
is 25 percent or more--that those who struggle every day to provide for 
their family, that they have a chance of a good education, an 
opportunity to get that job, that middle class job. If they have that, 
then this country will prosper and the kinds of divisions that 
sometimes rake us over the coals and cause us great consternation and 
trouble will be abated. They will never disappear--I have no 
illusions--but they will be abated, and they will be less. That should 
be our goal.
  As we approach the next fiscal crisis, just 2 months away, we should 
think about those men and women out there that I saw--and I suspect 
many of my colleagues saw as they returned home and went to their 
districts and went to all their meetings--who said: Can you just give 
us certainty? Can you stop the interminable fighting and the chaos that 
is causing us such concern, that is causing me not to invest in my 
business? Just give us certainty. Give us a program that builds a 
foundation so that my business can grow and prosper. Give us the tax 
policy that has the proper incentives, not just for those who have 
great wealth, but for those who are trying to grow their business. Give 
us a trade policy that is fairer to the American worker, fairer to the 
American business, that doesn't just give away this great country's 
wealth to some other company around the world, that doesn't encourage 
our businesses, our American corporations to go offshore. Put those 
policies in place so that we can grow the American economy, so that 
Americans can have a decent job and fulfill their own personal vision 
of the American Dream. They can get on that ladder, leading wherever 
they want it to lead, climb as high as they can, that the impairments 
and the impediments are not there. That should be our goal.
  We have about 2 months to avoid yet one other crisis. As we avoid it, 
I hope we keep in mind those things that create real wealth and real 
opportunity for all Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 15, 2013

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
H.R. 3350, the so called ``Keep Your Health Plan Act''.
  This bill is nothing more than the latest Republican effort to delay, 
defund, dismantle, or derail the Affordable Care Act.
  I remain committed to ensuring that my constituents in California and 
millions across the country have access to quality, affordable health 
care.
  Yet, the Republicans want nothing more than to capitalize on any 
opportunity to undermine the fundamental human right to healthcare. And 
that is what this latest attack is.
  While we must certainly address any challenges that arise in the roll 
out and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we cannot undermine 
its effectiveness by passing this cynical bill.
  In fact, just today, I received an email from a constituent who said 
that his plan had been cancelled, but once he had a chance to view the 
options on Covered California--California's healthcare exchange--he 
found a better plan at a better price.
  Stories like this one are happening all over the country and are 
further proof that we must not do anything to undermine the 
implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
  My constituents depend on it, as do millions of Americans.
  I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on this bill.

                     HELPING SICK AMERICANS NOW ACT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, despite blocked attempts 
to fully repeal the so-called Affordable Care Act, this law is doomed 
to collapse under the weight of its own flawed design. Just last week, 
Democratic Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a key architect of the 
Affordable Care Act, referred to the administration's signature health 
care law as a looming ``train wreck.'' Another promise that was used to 
force passage of the President's health law was broken in February, 
when the administration's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
announced that it would stop enrolling people with preexisting 
conditions due to funding constraints.
  This week, the House will vote on the Helping Sick Americans Now Act, 
which would extend access to those with preexisting conditions. The 
coverage would be funded by eliminating the Prevention and Public 
Health Fund, a program under ObamaCare identified as rife with 
mismanagement and taxpayer abuse.
  While full repeal would have been less costly and painful, the 
gradual failure of the Affordable Care Act is inflicting significant 
pain on families, businesses, and our economy. Don't take my word. Just 
listen to the Senator from Montana. His recent remarks aren't far off 
the mark.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, businesses across the

country have stopped hiring, and millions of Americans are beginning to 
see less take-home pay as a result of the Affordable Care Act's 30-hour 
workweek requirement.
  That is the crux of the problem with the Affordable Care Act, Madam 
Speaker. The law's burdensome employer requirements dissuade businesses 
from expanding and encourage shifting current workers from full to 
part-time work.
  Congress should be advancing policies to expand employment 
opportunities, especially during tough economic times, rather than 
undercutting the ability of Americans to earn more.
  This is the reason that the House today passed H.R. 2575, the Save 
American Workers Act, legislation that will allow businesses the 
opportunity to expand workers' hours by redefining full-time employees 
under the Affordable Care Act and reverting back to the traditional 40-
hour workweek definition.
  The Save American Workers Act will lessen the burden being imposed on 
employers and help to increase wages so that Americans, especially 
those with limited means, can better provide for their families.

                          HON. GARY C. PETERS

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 17, 2013

  Mr. PETERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize 
that this is the first time Republicans have embraced that the 
Affordable Health Care Act is law and supported its implementation 
starting in 2014. By offering and supporting H.R. 2667, House 
Republicans are finally voting for the health care law mandates to be 
implemented a year from now.
  For too long, Congress has been brought to a level of inaction that 
is unprecedented. The gridlock has frustrated me as well as the hard 
working men, women, small business owners and middle class families in 
my district in Michigan.
  Instead of working toward solutions and fixing a broken health care 
system, House Republicans wasted time and resources voting 37 votes to 
repeal The Affordable Care Act wholesale. Without the health care law, 
families would continue to fear illness because getting sick could mean 
bankruptcy. Michigan's middle class can't afford to continue without 
changes to our health care system, and the Affordable Care Act goes a 
long way to solve these problems.
  Today, every Republican who casts a vote to delay the employer and 
individual mandates is voting to get the implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act right and implement the law in full starting in 
December 2014.
  The President has already granted businesses one more year to 
implement the health care law. Without offering Michigan families the 
same temporary, one-year extension without penalty, businesses lose the 
incentive to offer coverage one year from now because their employees 
have already purchased insurance in the interim. These mandates work 
best in tandem as they will in the coming years.
  I look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans to improve 
the transition to more affordable health care coverage for Michigan 
families and businesses when the law is fully implemented.
  The Affordable Care Act will help lower health care costs for women, 
ensure coverage for children with pre-existing conditions, and curb the 
overall cost of health care.
  That is why I voted for the Affordable Care Act, and that's why I am 
voting today to get this law implemented fairly and in a way that

[[Page E1109]]

supports businesses and middle class families.

                   FAIRNESS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                         HON. YVETTE D. CLARKE

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 17, 2013

  Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 2668 the Fairness for American 
Families Act; which would seek to delay until 2015 the requirement that 
individuals maintain minimal essential health care coverage.
  Once again, for the 38th time, Republicans are voting to repeal parts 
of the Affordable Care Act.
  The individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care 
Act, which calls for purchasing coverage or paying a penalty, covers 
only those who have access to affordable coverage. If an individual 
does not have access to coverage with premiums that are 8 percent or 
less of their income, the individual is exempt.
  Individuals are also exempt if their income is so low they do not 
have to file a federal tax return; or if they qualify for an exemption

[[Page E1088]]

based on hardship, religious beliefs, and certain other factors; or 
they spend less than three consecutive months without coverage.
  Therefore, the Republicans' disingenuous concern that Americans will 
be punished if they are unable to afford coverage is simply not true!
  The Affordable Care Act's individual responsibility provision is a 
critical component of the additional patient protections and reforms 
that go into effect in 2014. Health experts have determined that if, 
beginning in 2014, insurers can no longer deny coverage to people with 
pre-existing conditions and can no longer charge them higher premiums, 
premiums in health insurance marketplaces would rise sharply unless all 
Americans with access to affordable insurance either purchase it or pay 
a penalty.
  This is yet another attempt to obstruct and undermine the successful 
implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
  The result of this bill's delay of the individual responsibility 
provision would be to limit access to affordable coverage for millions 
of Americans and thereby, weaken one of the primary premises of the 
Affordable Care Act.
  Don't fall for this trick! I ask my colleagues to stand in with me in 
solidarity and vote no on this bill.

                GIVE HEALTH CARE REFORM A CHANCE TO WORK

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, President Obama signed the 
historic Affordable Care Act into law. Since that time, we have seen an 
all-out assault by the special interests and health insurance 
companies.
  Americans are tired of this debate. They are tired of the 
misinformation. Congress must stand up for the middle class. We must 
protect families. We must stop companies from arbitrarily canceling 
coverage after patients become sick, prevent children from being denied 
coverage due to preexisting conditions, and never again let insurance 
companies place lifetime limits on health coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, let's give the reform a chance to work. Reject the 
special interests and extreme rhetoric. Make sure every American family 
is protected when it comes to health care.

                               speech of

                         HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, January 20, 2011

  Mr. CONYERS. Dear Madam Speaker, I inadvertently voted ``no'' on the 
Matheson amendment to H. Res. 9, which would instruct the committee of 
jurisdiction to include a permanent fix to the Medicare physician 
payment formula in legislation to replace the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act. I intended to vote ``yes'' on the Matheson 
amendment.
  I have always been a strong supporter of having the most optimal 
Medicare reimbursement rate for our nation's physicians. This is 
because the level of Medicare reimbursement rates to physicians does 
have a significant impact on the quality and level of health care 
physicians will provide to our nation's senior citizens and disabled.

                    NATIONAL LATINO ENROLLMENT WEEK

  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, the administration has declared this week to 
be National Latino Enrollment Week in the hopes of mounting a special 
push--a big rush--of Latinos rushing to sign up for the Affordable Care 
Act because it is supposedly going to help their lives in so many ways. 
Yet Latinos nationwide, like millions of other Americans, are 
discovering that they just can't afford the Affordable Care Act. Not 
only is it causing them to lose coverage, but they also see their 
premiums rise and have their health care plans canceled.
  The Spanish site that the administration promised would help people 
enroll reads as if it were written by a first-year Spanish student, and 
it has proven to have more problems than the actual English version of 
healthcare.gov.
  Where we live in the Central Valley, Latinos already struggle to 
access doctors. We have got a huge shortage of doctors, doctors that 
are willing to take Medicare and Medicaid, because of the reimbursement 
rates. So now, with the Affordable Care Act, we are going to have even 
fewer doctors and less access. Health care reform that doesn't increase 
their access is meaningless. The Affordable Care Act has also 
heightened their struggles.
  Mr. Speaker, we must repeal and replace this damaging law with one 
that benefits the Latino community and millions of others across the 
country.

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 30, 2013

  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, for the past 
48 years, Medicare has provided seniors and the disabled with the 
quality health care, economic security and peace of mind they deserve. 
Because of Medicare, millions of Americans have been able to grow old 
with respect and dignity instead of mounting medical debt and 
uncertainty.
  Let's not forget: Medicare is a family benefit. As a caregiver for my 
mother, I know firsthand just how important this benefit is to families 
all over New Mexico and America. Without Medicare, my mother would not 
be able to get the health care she needs, and there is absolutely no 
way I would be able to take care of her. Medicare has always been 
personal to me. It's personal to this day.
  This week, House Republicans will vote for the 40th time to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act. Every vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act 
is a vote to undermine Medicare. The Affordable Care Act has already 
strengthened Medicare and saved seniors money by eliminating co-pays 
for preventive care services, closing the prescription drug `donut 
hole' and extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by nearly a 
decade.
  Mr. Speaker, on this day and every day, we must remain committed to 
protecting and strengthening Medicare for today's seniors and for 
future generations.

                     BREAST CANCER MORBIDITY RATES

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday in Memphis at 10 o'clock, I will 
be holding the first of a series of health forums on issues of 
importance to the people of the Ninth District. The one on Thursday 
will be on the racial difference in breast cancer morbidity. A New York 
Times story told of a study which showed that African American women 
have a greater likelihood than Caucasian women of dying from breast 
cancer in Memphis than any other city. We will have a panel to discuss 
it and try to find ways to have people get mammograms, change their 
diets, and see their physicians.
  Under the Affordable Care Act, you don't have to pay a copay or a 
deductible to get preventative care. The Affordable Care Act could 
reverse that morbidity difference in Memphis. People need to get their 
mammograms.
  People can go to community health centers that have been funded 
through the Affordable Care Act to get mammograms, watch their diet, 
and reverse this horrible trend. I encourage people to come to the 
Church Health Center on Union at 10 o'clock Thursday morning in Memphis 
to learn about this problem.

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, many of my Republican colleagues are still 
obsessed with ending health care for the American citizen.
  I come here today to tell you the administration, experts, and my 
colleagues in Congress are working on making sure that all Americans 
have insurance.
  I say to you while they talk about ``glitch, glitch, glitches,'' yes, 
we are all disappointed with that. When they talk about the face of the 
stories, let me tell you that last week during our week at home, I held 
a tele-townhall conference, and many of my constituents called in and 
asked questions about the Affordable Care Act. Do you know why? Because 
they had a college student who can stay on their insurance. Do you know 
why? Because there were women who had pre-existing conditions now that 
can be covered. Do you know why? They were seniors. They were mothers. 
They were parents. That is what the Affordable Care Act is about.
  So I say to you to listen closely, America, because the Affordable 
Care Act will make a difference, and that is what we should have in 
this wonderful America that we live in.

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today, the White House's permanent campaign 
machine released a television ad promoting the Affordable Care Act and, 
unfortunately, it aims to completely mislead the public. The ad claims 
that Americans are seeing better coverage and lower costs because of 
the Affordable Care Act. That is pure fantasy.
  The fact is that premiums have been ratcheting upward across the 
country. On average, rates in Ohio will go up to almost $200 a month 
because of this law. It's the same story state by state. These rising 
costs clearly have the administration worried that people are going to 
understand how bad the Affordable Care Act is.
  Enroll America is set to spend tens of millions of dollars in 
promoting this law. This is money that they raised by using current and 
former administration officials to unethically, if not illegally, 
strong-arm donations from health care companies that are regulated by 
the Department of Health and Human Services.
  The administration put together a law that hurts families and now 
they have to spend tens of millions of dollars telling people that 
``hey, it ain't so bad.''
  Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty. It should be stopped.

                               ACA REPEAL

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today, for the 37th time, the Republicans 
set a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Yet again, this is a 
waste of time and taxpayer resources on pure political posturing, 
rather than working hard on behalf of hardworking American taxpayers.
  As a freshman Member, I can tell you where I stand, and that is in 
100 percent pure full support of the Affordable Care Act.
  Republicans have ignored real problems affecting our country and 
instead have chosen to attack the poor and most vulnerable. Millions of 
Americans are already enjoying protections and benefits under the law. 
In my State of Texas, over 300,000 young adults are able to stay under 
their parents' plan. Over 3 million women and 1.8 million senior 
citizens have access to preventive care. Many more will have insurance 
coverage once the insurance exchanges are in place for 2014.
  Republicans constantly talk about requiring more efficiency and 
reducing redundancy in Federal Government. How about we start reducing 
redundancy right here in Congress? Let's move beyond messaging bills 
and into actual substantive legislation. Let's focus on jobs and grow 
the economy rather than wasting money on repealing the Affordable Care 
Act.

                     OBAMACARE FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, many of us were surprised on July 2 when 
the administration unilaterally suspended the employer mandate in the 
Affordable Care Act. Since there were going to be no reporting 
requirements under the employer mandate, how were people going to be 
judged as eligible for benefits under the Affordable Care Act? Well, we 
would simply take their word for it. ``Self-attestation'' became the 
watchword and buzzword in the administration.
  Last Thursday, again, people were surprised that the Department of 
Health and Human Services' Inspector General's Office is going to lose 
20 percent of its staff between now and 2015.
  Well, wait a minute. We are going to a system of self-reporting, 
self-attestation, but we are cutting the staff of the office who is 
going to see that the funds are properly spent. Oh, by the way, all the 
while, we are going to be increasing the funding for the so-called 
navigators, people who are going to sign people up for the Affordable 
Care Act under their own self-attestation.
  It seems like we are going in the wrong direction here. We do need to 
keep an eye on these funds. They could go out the door inappropriately. 
We owe it to the taxpayer to be more vigilant.

                         WAR ON WOMEN'S HEALTH

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, over the past several months, we have 
seen Republicans wage war on women's health. Nowhere can the Republican 
zeal for limiting women's access to affordable quality health care be 
seen more clearly than in their attempt to dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act.
  Improving health care has long been a priority for women, reflecting 
their experiences as patients, mothers, and caregivers. For decades 
insurance companies have been able to deny coverage and charge higher 
rates for women simply because of their gender. Thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act--the greatest advancement for women's health in a 
generation--this will no longer be legal. This law moves us closer to 
the day when essential women's health services are covered, prevention 
is a priority, and care is coordinated.
  On the eve of the 2-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, I 
join my colleagues in protecting health care reform for women, and I 
rebuke all attempts to continue discriminatory health insurance 
policies that result in women paying more than men.

     clause 9 of rule XXI, shall be considered as read, shall be

     controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be 
     subject to a demand for division of the question; (3) the 
     further amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in 
     part D of the report of the Committee on Rules, if offered by

     one hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and 
     an opponent; and (4) one motion to recommit, with or without 
     instructions, which shall be considered as read.
       Sec. 2.  During consideration of an amendment printed in

     as though under clause 8 of rule XX.

     in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3961) to 
     amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to reform the 
     Medicare SGR payment system for physicians. All points of 
     order against consideration of the bill are waived except 
     those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The bill 
     shall be considered as read. All points of order against 
     provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question 
     shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage 
     without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate

     (2) one motion to recommit.
       Sec. 4.  In the engrossment of H.R. 3961, the Clerk shall--
        (a) add the text of H.R. 2920, as passed by the House, as 
     new matter at the end of H.R. 3961;
       (b) conform the title of H.R. 3961 to reflect the addition 
     to the engrossment of the text of H.R. 2920;
       (c) assign appropriate designations to provisions within 
     the engrossment; and
       (d) conform provisions for short titles within the 
     engrossment.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York is recognized 
for 1 hour.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield 
the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). 
All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only.


                             General Leave

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks 
and to insert extraneous materials into the Record.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from New York?
  There was no objection.

                              {time}  1045

  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 903 provides for consideration of H.R. 3962, the 
Affordable Health Care for America Act, under a structured rule. The 
rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill 
except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI and provides 4 
hours of debate controlled by the Committees on Energy and Commerce and 
on Education and Labor.
  The rule makes in order the amendment in part C of the report if 
offered by Representative Stupak or a designee. The rules makes in 
order the substitute amendment in part D of the report if offered by 
Mr. Boehner or his designee.
  H. Res. 903 also provides for consideration of H.R. 3961, the 
Medicare Physician Reform Act, under a closed rule. The rule waives all 
points of order against consideration of the bill except those arising 
under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI, and upon passage of the bill, the 
Clerk is directed to add at the end the text of H.R. 2920 as passed by 
the House.
  I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
Schakowsky) for a unanimous consent request.
  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend 
her remarks.)

[[Page H12599]]

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of reform that will 
allow millions of American women to get the health care they need.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield for a unanimous consent request to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).
  (Mrs. LOWEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her 
remarks.)
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I support health care that helps senior 
women afford their medications through Medicare.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield for a unanimous 
consent request to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney).
  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her 
remarks.)
  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I support ending gender discrimination in 
premium prices.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).
  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support the 
Democratic health care bill because it eliminates disparities that harm 
a woman's health.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee) for a unanimous consent request.
  (Ms. LEE of California asked and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I support affordable health care 
and this Democratic bill so that domestic violence may never be used 
ever again as a preexisting condition.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Ms. Kilpatrick) for a unanimous consent request.
  (Ms. KILPATRICK of Michigan asked and was given permission to revise 
and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KILPATRICK of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I support our House bill 
which will let women and doctors control their health decisions.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield for a unanimous consent request 
to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren).
  (Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California asked and was given permission to 
revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I support the Democratic 
bill to let our kids in their 20s get insurance and keep healthy.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield for a unanimous consent request 
to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton).
  (Ms. SUTTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend her 
remarks.)
  Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I support health care reform that improves 
the nursing workforce and is endorsed by the American Nursing 
Association.

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to revise 
and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I support the Democratic bill 
because it will keep women and their families healthy, not just take 
care of them when they are sick.


                        Parliamentary Inquiries

  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I was just wondering if this was a 
stalling tactic by the majority party on delaying the vote on this 
important bill which will kill 5.5 million jobs today?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will observe that is not a correct 
parliamentary inquiry. The Chair will observe, on this side of the 
aisle, I don't think anybody wants to stall the bill.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, continuing to reserve the right to 
object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on his 
reservation.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I understand that this may be a train that is 
rolling, but it appears that the majority side is interested in 
stalling this bill. Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent 
that all extension and revision of remarks could be done en bloc.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would observe that such unanimous 
consent has already been granted. The Chair would note that there are a 
lot of Members around here that want to ask unanimous consent. The 
Chair intends to recognize them and let their unanimous consents be 
judged by the Chair and the House as suitable.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, continuing to observe the right to 
object, how about increasing the debate time? It appears that the 
majority party is attempting to expand their debate time.
  I would ask unanimous consent that each side be added 1 hour of 
debate time.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the right to 
object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would be delighted to hear the 
gentleman on his reservation.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Again, Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that 
the majority party appears to be continuing to delay the process here. 
It would be appropriate, if the majority party is interested in 
fairness in this process, to provide for increasing debate time on both 
sides of the aisle.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair observes that regular order has 
been demanded. As such, the gentleman must either object, or withdraw 
his reservation.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair hears objection. The Chair would 
hope the gentleman would not object, but if he does, it will be in the 
Record.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, continuing to reserve then, if you 
are not interested in obtaining my objection, continuing to reserve, 
again it appears that this is a process by which the majority party is 
interested once again in trying to subvert the rules and expand the 
debate time on the majority side.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection was heard. The gentleman from 
Texas will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SESSIONS. The question is, could the Speaker please advise us of 
the time that is being consumed. Does it come off the time that would 
be allowed in the rule for debate by the gentlewoman from New York?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A Member asking to insert remarks into the 
Record may include a simple declaration of sentiment toward the 
question under debate but should not embellish the request with 
extended oratory.
  The gentlewoman from New York is recognized.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Woolsey) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and 
extend my remarks in support of this bill because it will make health 
care affordable for women who still earn 77 percent less than men.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas on his reservation.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I believe that what is occurring is that 
the facts of the case are that this has gone beyond the rules of the 
House in the presentation, and I object and would ask for regular 
order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has objected.
  The gentlewoman from New York continues to be recognized.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii 
(Ms. Hirono) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend 
my remarks because the women in my district cannot wait any longer for 
meaningful health care reform.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized on 
his reservation.

[[Page H12600]]

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I believe what is occurring now is not 
only opposed to the House rules but is containing further comment, 
which was not allowed in the rule nor in the general provisions of the 
House.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will restate the ruling that the 
Chair made earlier.
  A Member asking to insert remarks may include a simple declaration of 
sentiment towards the question under debate but should not embellish 
the request with extended oratory.
  The Chair has heard nothing which contravenes that, and the Chair 
makes the statement to my good friend that we will continue as we have 
in allowing each Member----
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is out of order. The Chair is 
busy ruling.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Could the Speaker please advise me about the time that 
is presently being consumed?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend.
  The Chair recognizes the distinguished gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield for a unanimous 
consent request to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard).
  (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD asked and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.)

                              {time}  1100

  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Democratic 
bill because it will help women with breast cancer pay for 
chemotherapy.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unanimous consent request has been 
entered. That is the business of the House.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, regular order, please.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has ruled.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Is it not appropriate for a Member of the House 
to be able to reserve a right to object on a unanimous consent request?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is going to inform the gentleman 
that he has the right to make a timely reservation. The Chair is going 
to observe that such was not made.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Further inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his inquiry.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. An objection is no longer timely.
  The gentlewoman from New York continues to be recognized.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlelady from California 
(Mrs. Capps) for a unanimous consent request.
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend 
my remarks in support of reforms that ensure that no mother will ever 
have her child's care denied because of a preexisting condition.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  The Chair wants to remind my colleagues, we are going to try and have 
a fair and orderly debate.
  The Chair is going to remind my colleagues that every Member has a 
right to place a unanimous consent before the House. The Chair is going 
to protect that right for the majority and the Chair is going to 
protect that right for the minority. And if delay occurs, at this 
moment it appears to the Chair that the delay occurs less on the 
Chair's right than it does on the Chair's left.
  The Chair will observe if the gentleman is concerned about speeding 
the business of the House, the business of the House can best be 
speeded by allowing the unanimous consent requests to be made.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his inquiry.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. At the time that a unanimous consent request is 
made, the Speaker has apparently determined that the statement, as soon 
as it is completed, does not allow for a reservation. Is it not, under 
the rules of the House, appropriate for a Member of the House to 
reserve a right to object based upon a unanimous consent request?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is going to instruct the gentleman 
lightly upon the rules of the House by observing that reservations must 
be made in a timely fashion.
  The Chair will protect the rights of the gentleman to assert timely 
objections or to proceed in an appropriate manner under the rules.
  The Chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlelady from California 
(Mrs. Napolitano) for a unanimous consent request.
  (Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of health care reform 
that eliminates out-of-pocket costs for osteoporosis screenings.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. 
Kilroy) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. KILROY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent----
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on his 
reservation.
  Mr. DREIER. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Regular order, please.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Regular order is demanded.
  The Chair is going to make this observation for the benefit of my 
colleagues. After a demand for regular order, a reservation of 
objection may no longer be entertained. A Member must either object or 
withdraw the reservation.
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I have reserved the right to object. Am I 
allowed to be heard under that reservation at this juncture?
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Regular order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. That, the Chair regrets, cannot be done 
because the Chair has heard a demand for regular order, which precludes 
that.
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I cannot reserve the right to object to the 
unanimous consent request?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Not after a demand for the regular order has 
been heard.
  What is happening, the Chair will inform my dear friends, is we are 
getting ourselves into an unnecessarily deep parliamentary morass. If 
my colleagues on the Chair's left would withhold these objections, we 
would not be in this snarl at this time.
  Now, does the gentleman object?
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to object and wish to be 
heard on my reservation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair rules that out of order.
  The Chair makes the observation that since a demand for the regular 
order has been made, reservations may no longer be raised. Perceiving 
that the gentleman from California has withdrawn his reservation, the 
Chair recognizes now, again, the gentlewoman from New York, who 
controls the time at this moment.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I have already yielded to the gentlelady 
from Ohio (Ms. Kilroy).
  Ms. KILROY. I thank the gentlelady from New York.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks 
in support of the Democratic bill because----
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I object.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Ms. KILROY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.
  Do I not have the right to be able to continue my sentence without 
objections that are trying to censure my remarks here on the floor that 
I have a right to make as a Member of Congress?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard. The gentlewoman will 
suspend.
  The gentlewoman from New York again is recognized.

[[Page H12601]]

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire of Ms. Kilroy, have you 
had time to raise your objection?
  Ms. KILROY. I ask unanimous consent again to revise and extend my 
remarks because this----
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  Ms. KILROY. I rise in support of this Democratic bill because it 
won't force women into a bare bones policy, high deductible, and high-
cost plan.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection has been heard.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would ask to be heard.
  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans are asking for an extension of 1 hour on 
both sides under the rule that will equally allow both sides 30 
additional minutes to be heard, because it's obvious that Members of 
Congress need to be heard and this rule does not provide the amount of 
time necessary, and the people who are here is an example of why this 
is wrong.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has not yet been 
recognized for debate. The gentleman will resume his seat and we will 
proceed with the business of the House.
  The Chair continues to recognize the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlelady from the Virgin 
Islands for a unanimous consent request.
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and 
extend my remarks in support of providing affordable coverage for the 
39 percent of Latinos, 23 percent of African Americans, and 34 percent 
of Native Americans who are not insured.
  Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  The gentlewoman from New York is recognized.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
Harman) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, because it eliminates cost sharing and makes 
access to health care more affordable, as a mother of four and a 
grandmother of three, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my 
remarks in support of the Democratic bill.
  Ms. FALLIN. Mr. Speaker, I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The objection is heard.
  The Chair requests the gentlemen and gentlewomen of the House to heed 
the gavel. The Chair will try to protect the rights of all and will see 
that the proceedings are conducted in accordance with the rules. And 
the Chair asks the Members not to make that any more difficult than 
they must.
  The Chair continues to recognize the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. Castor) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, because the Democratic bill gives women more 
opportunities and offers to modernize health care, I ask unanimous 
consent to revise and extend my remarks in support of the Democratic 
bill.
  Ms. FALLIN. I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  The Chair continues to recognize the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin 
(Ms. Baldwin) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, because it is time to protect older women 
by closing the doughnut hole, I ask unanimous consent to revise and 
extend my remarks in support of this bill.
  Mrs. BACHMANN. I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  The Chair has a comment to make here. The Chair is going to request 
the Members on both sides of the aisle to respect the rights of other 
Members. Members have the right, under the rules, to ask unanimous 
consent. If Members on one side of the aisle want their right 
protected, the Chair observes that they should then respect the rights 
of Members on the other side of the aisle. It will be the purpose of 
the Chair to try and see that all Members are heard at the proper time 
and fashion and to see that the rules are carried out. The Chair will 
also try to see that the debate is conducted with a measure of comity 
and grace and decency, and the Chair would request my friends on both 
sides of the aisle to respect that.


                        Parliamentary Inquiries

  Mr. CULBERSON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state it.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, to fulfill your proper admonition of the 
House that we proceed with comity and respect and allow the voices on 
both sides to be heard, my parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker, is to 
ask that we would--and we are prepared to do so with a unanimous 
consent--agree to expand the debate by 1 hour to allow other Members of 
the House on both sides--could we have a unanimous consent request, Mr. 
Speaker, to expand the debate?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will observe that my friend has 
not stated a proper parliamentary inquiry.
  The Chair simply wants to make this observation. We can spend a long 
time here on this particular wrangle or we can allow the proceedings to 
go forward. Everybody will have a chance to be heard as long as the 
House is presided over by this particular Member.
  The Chair just requests my friends on the minority side, let's let 
the discussion go forward. It isn't hurting anything, and there is no 
advantage to be achieved by making all of this fuss.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, is it in order, I would like to make a 
unanimous consent to expand the debate by 1 hour.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair observes that that can only be 
done at this time by the gentlewoman from New York yielding for the 
purpose of that kind of unanimous consent request.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentlelady from New York yield to expand the 
debate by 1 hour? I would like to make that unanimous consent request 
to expand the debate by 1 hour so that everyone can speak.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I am calling for regular order. I would like to really 
get on with this bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair observes that the gentlewoman from 
New York has not yielded for that purpose and that, therefore, the 
request is not in order.
  The gentlewoman from New York continues to be recognized.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlelady from California 
(Ms. Eshoo) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend 
my remarks on this bill which will limit age ratings that make coverage 
unaffordable for older women.
  Mrs. BACHMANN. I object, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  The gentlewoman from New York continues to be recognized.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlelady from 
Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. TSONGAS. Because women shouldn't have to buy a separate policy 
for maternity care, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and 
extend my remarks in support of the Democratic bill.
  Mrs. BACHMANN. I object, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.


                        Parliamentary Inquiries

  Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state the parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, is it not correct procedure in 
the House of Representatives for the purpose, when a Member offers a 
unanimous consent request, that the objection be heard after the 
conclusion of the unanimous consent request?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is correct in that the Chair 
has been trying to see to it, amidst a somewhat disorderly House, that 
the request for unanimous consent is uttered before the objection is 
heard.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state the parliamentary 
inquiry.

[[Page H12602]]

  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Does the rule not provide on a unanimous 
consent request that there be no significant embellishment of remarks, 
and in fact the majority party has continued to embellish their remarks 
upon their UC request?

                              {time}  1115

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is kind of wearing out this 
ruling, but the Chair will respond again for the benefit of my good 
friend by observing this:
  A Member asking to insert remarks may include a simple declaration of 
sentiment toward the question under debate, but should not embellish 
the requests with extended oratory. The Chair is going to try and 
enforce that, and the Chair would suggest to all Members that we 
respect each other's rights and, on this side, that Members observe the 
rule and on that side that the Members permit the Members on this side 
to observe the rule and to make their necessary points. The Chair will 
try and enforce these rules in a fair and proper way.
  The Chair observes that the proceedings will proceed more speedily if 
the Members will assist the Chair in this particular way.
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from Nevada 
(Ms. Titus) for a unanimous consent request.
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, because the Democratic bill covers the 
preventative services that women need to stay healthy, I ask unanimous 
consent to revise and extend my remarks in support of such bill.
  Mrs. BACHMANN. I object.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.
  Now the Chair would like to make an observation for the benefit of 
everybody.
  The whole process will proceed more speedily if we, first of all, 
observe the rules and, second of all, if we afford reasonable courtesy 
to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The Chair calls on 
the Democrats to do that and the Republicans.
  Now, the Chair simply wants to make this statement for the benefit of 
Members on the minority side who may not have understood the Chair's 
motives, but the Chair will hear each unanimous-consent request 
individually and will hear each objection individually, and the Chair 
will ask the Members to cooperate in that. The House should have an 
orderly process that will reflect well on it in historical perspective.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state it.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, is there any other motion that the 
minority can make other than a unanimous consent to expand the debate 
and allow more Members of the House to be heard in an amicable way?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair just will adhere to the 
traditional practices of the House and not respond to.."

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, all over this country many 
thousands are not being hired because of the so-called Affordable Care 
Act, which is really unaffordable. Many thousands more are seeing their 
hours cut so they do not go over the 30-hour-per-week threshold. 
Someone said the new normal is now two 20-hour-a-week jobs.
  Now the State of Tennessee has had to notify 16,000 Tennesseans they 
can no longer have coverage under CoverTN, a low-cost health care plan 
for small businesses and the self-employed. The plan is being abolished 
because it does not meet all the bureaucratic requirements of 
ObamaCare.
  Senator Lamar Alexander said:

       The new health care law has destroyed an innovative State 
     health insurance plan that is helping 16,000 Tennesseans 
     afford health care coverage.

  When the President was selling ObamaCare to Americans, he said again 
and again that people who had insurance they liked could keep it. 
Despite the President's promises, Tennesseeans enrolled with CoverTN 
are among the thousands of Americans who are being forced to buy new, 
more expensive plans with much higher premiums because of the 
``Unaffordable Care Act.''

  (Mr. BARBER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BARBER. Mr. Speaker, I believe we have a solemn duty to protect 
the privacy of all Americans. I think all of us here believe that, too.
  I am committed to helping southern Arizonans have access to the 
Affordable Care Act through the healthcare.gov Web site, and we must 
ensure that their personal and medical information is protected.
  That is why I will be introducing the CARE Act, which will require 
that the Department of Homeland Security develop the highest 
cybersecurity standards for healthcare.gov, and for Department of 
Health and Human Services to implement these standards within 90 days.
  In a recent hearing in the Committee on Homeland Security, we learned 
that too little has been done to protect the privacy of Americans 
accessing the Web site. My constituents and the people across this 
country deserve to know that when they interact with this Web site, 
their personal information will be safe and secure. That is what my 
bill ensures.
  I urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans alike, to join 
me in support of this critical legislation.

                   HEALTH CARE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS ACT

  (Mr. DAINES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAINES. Mr. Speaker, our Founders believed that conscience and 
religious rights occupied the highest rung on the civil liberty 
protection ladder. The Obama administration has fallen short of these 
expectations.
  As a fifth-generation Montanan and a person of faith, I know that my 
faith does not begin and end at the doors of our church. Living the 
principles of what I believe is a key part of my faith.
  But under the Affordable Care Act, religious institutions and 
employers, as well as health care providers who hold religious and 
moral convictions, are stripped of their religious freedoms. Religious 
institutions and employers are forced to pay for coverage of 
contraceptive methods. Health care providers do not have the protection 
to refuse to perform abortion services that they are morally opposed 
to. That is a violation of the First Amendment.
  That is why I am proud to help introduce the Health Care Conscience 
Rights Act, which will uphold our constitutional rights of religious 
freedom and uphold our moral calling to practice life-affirming health 
care.

                              HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Tipton) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, there are probably very few issues that 
touch Americans, families, our States, and small businesses more 
personally than health care.
  This House has dealt numerous times with addressing the Affordable 
Care Act. But when we talk about it on that very personal level--of a 
mom taking a sick child down to visit the doctor, to a senior citizen 
who's counting on that hospital being able to be there, to be able to 
deliver the care that they need--we need to recognize that the 
overarching view that Washington typically performs when passing a bill 
and delivering it to the American people, that it has very real 
consequences, very real impacts.
  In my district in rural Colorado--and in fact throughout rural 
America--there is a looming health care crisis that is just on the 
horizon. That ability to be able to go to the doctor, to be able to 
have a hospital that's going to be there to be able to provide the 
service that's necessary--they're feeling that real impact right now at 
home.
  We've had a lot of discussion about that big, overarching bill: the 
IPAB boards that are going to be making the medical choices for our 
senior citizens--indeed for all Americans--rather than that choice 
being made between the doctor and the patient; about the State mandates 
that are coming through; the Medicare payment cuts; higher health 
costs; the budget that is now going to be estimated at $1.76 trillion 
in costs over a 10-year period, and rising, on a struggling American 
economy, on struggling families and small businesses; the 150 new 
boards that are being established; the better than 12,000 pages of new 
regulations that our hospitals, our doctors, and our families are going 
to have to be dealing with; and the short form, to simply be able to 
fill out and be able to apply for the Affordable Care Act, 21 pages 
just to be able to get insurance.
  We need, Mr. Speaker, to be talking about those real impacts, not 
from the 30,000-foot view, but on the ground at home.
  I recently went to Delta Memorial Hospital in my district, a small 
community hospital that's proud of their service. In fact, they've had 
multiple surveys that went through and rated their service among the 
best. They are now being challenged by the Affordable Care Act in terms 
of that health care delivery.
  They have a program called the Recovery Audit Contracts conducted by 
individual companies that don't even have to have health care 
background, but they're going back in and reassessing costs. And 
they're having to pay back money now, money that they simply do not 
have.
  We're seeing reimbursements to doctors drop at Delta Memorial 
Hospital, making it harder for the physicians to be able to deliver 
that service.
  These are small hospitals. They don't have big HR departments; 
they're there for the health of the community. But they are seeing real 
challenges in being able to continue. In fact, in many of our rural 
hospitals, they're beginning to wonder if they're going to be able to 
continue to deliver that service.

                              {time}  1040

  I've talked to doctors in Delta, Montrose, Grand Junction, Pueblo, 
throughout my entire district, who are frustrated that they are now 
seeing their reimbursements--money that they need to have to be able to 
conduct their business--being cut by the Federal Government, the 
Federal Government determining what the value of that service is going 
to be and saying you can afford it. That's not real life.
  What we are seeing now are senior citizens who just became senior 
citizens by the virtue of a birthday over the last few months, they 
cannot find a doctor who is willing to take Medicare, simply because 
they can no longer afford it.
  We have a system, Mr. Speaker, that completely forgot the original 
premise that every American, I believe, can agree on. We need to have 
real reform, but we need to go back to that initial premise of 
affordability and accessibility. The Affordable Care Act fails on both 
levels.
  We are seeing right now, in my home State of Colorado, estimates for 
individual insurance policies this year are going to go up an estimated 
23 percent or more. Small businesses, who are trying to provide group 
insurance, are seeing their costs going up this year estimated better 
than 17 percent.
  Have we achieved more affordability, as was promised? We have not.
  When we are talking about that accessibility issue, when that senior 
citizen in Delta, Colorado, walks into a doctor's office and is told 
that they aren't accepting any new patients, are we achieving that 
accessibility? We are not.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to go back to that original premise, because so 
many small businesses right now that would like to be able to deliver 
that service are feeling the impact. I have a friend who owns several 
small Pizza Huts throughout the West, and she is dealing with those 
additional costs that are hurting her business and her ability to be 
able to deliver that real service for her employees.
  We have a challenge in this country, Mr. Speaker, and it can and will 
be addressed if we will go back to that original premise of 
affordability and accessibility. The Affordable Care Act fails on both 
points.
  Let's roll up our sleeves and get the job done for the American 
people.

[Pages S8670-S8671]
                           HEALTH CARE REFORM

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the past 3 weeks I think I have come 
to the floor three times to discuss the case on the President's health 
care reform bill: one time to discuss the constitutionality of the 
individual mandate and another time to deal with the severability 
clause. I come now to speak about the unconstitutionality of the 
massive expansion of Medicaid. Those are three of four issues that the 
Court is going to deal with. My colleagues probably remember the Court 
has extended the period of time they normally deal with arguments 
before them from 1 hour to 5\1/2\ hours because this is such a very 
important case.
  Today I wish to talk about the far-reaching implications of this 
mandate, but also about the constitutionality of the Medicaid 
expansion. If the Supreme Court rules the individual mandate 
unconstitutional, it will have the effect of striking down this new law 
that has not been fully implemented. If the Supreme Court rules that 
the Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, 
it has the potential to cause significant changes in a program that has 
been in operation for the last 46 years.
  Just to remind everybody about Medicaid, it was created in 1965 at 
exactly the same time Medicare was created. Where Medicare was created 
to provide health care coverage for our senior citizens, Medicaid was 
created as a safety net for low-income individuals. Medicare is run 
exclusively by the Federal Government. Medicaid is a Federal-State 
partnership. The Federal Government sets the parameters of the Medicaid 
Program. It pays at least half of the program in every State but then 
turns the functional operation of the Medicaid Program over to the 
States.
  In the 46 years since both programs were created, eligibility for the 
Medicare Program has been essentially unchanged. On the other hand, 
eligibility for the Medicaid Program has expanded significantly through 
the years and, with that, the program has grown dramatically as well.
  Medicaid, when it was created, covered fewer than 5 million. Today, 
the Medicaid Program currently covers nearly 57 million. The program 
spends more than $300 billion each year.
  Medicaid has expanded so dramatically for two reasons. First, at 
various points in the last 46 years Congress has mandated that the 
States increase eligibility and services for the program. Second, 
Congress has also given the States the option to expand their 
eligibility. When Congress gives States the option of expanding their 
eligibility, States can expand and the Federal Government will still 
provide its proportionate share of Federal dollars.
  For instance, one of the programs I helped get passed with Senator 
Kennedy from Massachusetts when he was a Member of the Senate was a 
program that allowed some help for families who had particularly high 
health care costs for kids--something that was just catastrophically 
high. That is just one example.
  The decision to expand is up to the States. When Congress mandates 
the States expand eligibility, States can either expand their programs 
or forfeit all Federal funds for the program.
  Now, this is what we call an all-or-nothing requirement. It has been 
used in every expansion of the program. The all-or-nothing requirement 
on States has not only been used to expand eligibility within the 
Medicaid Program, but it has been used to expand services and require 
changes in the administration of the program.

  If the Federal Government wants States to cover podiatrists in 
Medicaid, the Federal Government can mandate States to do so. If a 
State doesn't do it? Withhold all Federal dollars to that State. If the 
Federal Government wants States to implement a secondary payer program 
to ensure that services are being properly paid by private dollars, the 
Federal Government can mandate States to do so and withhold every 
Federal dollar if that State refuses to go along.
  It has been a staple of the program for 46 years that the Federal 
Government can require States to do certain things in Medicaid. Now 
comes along the Affordable Care Act. That act requires States to expand 
their Medicaid Program to cover all individuals up to 133 percent of 
the poverty level. It is the first expansion of Medicaid's mandatory 
eligibility groups since the all-or-nothing expansion in the bills of 
1989 and 1990. Those were both reconciliation acts.
  It is this all-or-nothing requirement that States are challenging and 
that the Supreme Court will consider next year and has given a certain 
portion of the 5\1/2\ hours just to debate this issue. So I think that 
means the Supreme Court thinks this is a very significant issue they 
are being asked to consider.
  So I would like to describe the arguments being made by the States 
that this is an unconstitutional use of congressional power. The States 
argue that the 10th amendment limits the power of Congress to coerce 
States to accept Federal funds as opposed to providing inducements. The 
States argue that a restriction on Federal funds compels rather than 
induces if its burdens and losses as they affect vital ordinary State 
functions are too burdensome and costly. So I quote from their 
position:

       By conditioning all of the States Federal Medicaid 
     funding--for most States, more than a billion dollars each 
     year--upon agreement to substantially expand their Medicaid 
     programs, the Affordable Care Act passes the point at which 
     pressure turns into compulsion and achieves forbidden direct 
     regulation of the States.

  The part of the quote which says it is at the point where pressure 
turns into compulsion makes the act unconstitutional because it has 
always been a principle that the Federal Government can put certain 
conditions on States, but if it reaches a point where the State has to 
do it, in this case the States say: You have really gone too far.
  The Affordable Care Act withholds all Federal dollars, then, from 
States that refuse to submit to the policy dictates of the Congress. 
Medicaid accounts for more than 40 percent of all Federal funds that 
States receive. States spend on average 20 percent of their State 
budget on Medicaid. Federal funds cover, on average, 57 cents of each 
dollar spent on the program because previously I said the Federal 
Government gives every State at least 50 percent, but the average of 
all 50 States is 57 percent of the Medicaid dollars coming from Federal 
dollars.
  In my State of Iowa, for instance, I think it is 63 percent from the 
Federal Government and 37 percent of State funds. So the loss of all 
Federal Medicaid funding would obviously be devastating to the States.
  The States maintain that the law's expansion of Medicaid was 
deliberately designed to force the States to agree to expand the 
program because of the threat that a State's entire Federal funding 
stream would be cut off if they decided not to go along with decisions 
made in Congress. In the harshest terms, they were made an offer they 
could not refuse. Further quoting from the States' argument:

       The Affordable Care Act essentially holds the States 
     hostage based on their earlier decision to establish a 
     Medicaid infrastructure and accept federal funds subject to 
     different conditions.
       The Affordable Care Act uses the States' decision to accept 
     earlier federal inducements against them, and, in doing so, 
     presents states with no real choice: they must abandon 
     completely the existing Medicaid system and funding or accept 
     the radical new conditions. This amounts to a massive bait-
     and-switch.

  The States are arguing to the Supreme Court that there is no way the 
States can turn down a Federal inducement as massive as all Medicaid 
funding.
  This is especially true because the effect of declining is that the 
State's own taxpayers have to pay the full cost of providing health 
care for the neediest citizens of the State and, at the same time, 
provide the Federal Government taxes for Medicaid funds that would be 
distributed to pay for the program, including expansion in the other 49 
States.
  Since no State could make taxpayers fund the State and Federal 
portions of Medicaid, while also taxing their citizens to pay for 
Medicaid in the other 49 States, it is a phony choice, not a real 
choice, for the States to turn down the money to expand their Medicaid 
Programs. In other words, the States are being compelled to do so.
  The States argue that giving notice of the coercion they face does 
not make the choice any less coercive, and they argue that when States 
originally accepted Medicaid, they were not

[[Page S8671]]

warned that their participation would put them at the mercy of any 
future unpredictable congressional demands.
  The States are arguing Congress can change Medicaid, and Congress can 
condition the funding for those changes on State agreement to them.
  But it cannot force changes on the States by threatening them with 
the loss of the entirety of Federal funds.
  Although the Federal Government will pay the vast majority of the 
cost of expansion, the States also point out that coercion turns on the 
financial inducement that Congress offers, not the amount a State is 
coerced to spend.
  The critical issue is what is referred to as the ``coercion 
doctrine.'' The coercion doctrine protects the States' decision whether 
the inducement is worth the cost.
  Among the controlling cases is South Dakota v. Dole in 1987. The 
Supreme Court there upheld a Federal law that threatened States with 
the loss of 5 percent of Federal highway funds if they did not raise 
their drinking age to 21.
  Remember, that was only 5 percent of their road funds, not 100 
percent of their road funds, as in the case of the all-or-nothing in 
the case of Medicaid, where if you do not go along, you are going to 
lose everything.
  So in that Dole case, writing for the majority, Chief Justice 
Rehnquist noted:

       Our decisions have recognized that, in some circumstances, 
     the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so 
     coercive as to pass the point at which ``pressure turns into 
     compulsion.''

  In the years since the Dole decision, Federal courts have yet to 
establish a clear test for coercion. I assume that is what could happen 
if they would overturn Congress's decision; that there would be a 
clearer test of coercion in this Affordable Care Act.
  The Supreme Court will be challenged in this affordable care act case 
to determine where the limits of Federal coercion, if any, lie.
  It is difficult to overstate the potential implications of this 
particular aspect of the affordable care act in the case that is being 
appealed.
  There are three specific ways this decision could have a profound 
impact on Federal policy if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the 
States.
  A ruling for the States could affect future Medicaid policy, current 
Medicaid policy, and broader Federal-State partnerships.
  The expansion of Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act was written to 
minimize the cost to the States. The Federal Government pays for 100 
percent of the cost of the Medicaid expansion in the first few years, 
before transitioning to an approximately 92-percent share of the cost 
of the expansion.
  If the Federal Government cannot require expansion of the Medicaid 
Program and pick up 92 percent of the tab, what can the Federal 
Government require? Would a mandatory expansion be constitutional if 
the Federal Government permanently paid for 100 percent of the cost? 
Could the Federal Government mandate future expansions if they were 
much smaller in scope, such as in the 1989 and 1990 mandatory 
expansions under those reconciliation bills?
  If the Federal Government wanted to require States to cover 
podiatrists or implement a secondary payer program, could it do so 
using Federal funds as leverage to require it?
  A ruling in favor of the States would raise those questions.
  Further, if the current mandatory expansion of Medicaid is 
unconstitutional, what does that imply for previous expansions and 
policies?
  In the 1989 and 1990 acts, when Congress required States to expand 
eligibility for women and children, Congress did so without providing 
any additional funding to the States beyond their normal share, which 
in the case of Iowa today would be 63 percent Federal, 37 percent 
State.
  If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the States, will previous 
mandatory expansions to Medicaid be subject to challenge? Will a State 
be able to challenge the existing enforcement mechanism of withholding 
Federal dollars if a State wants to ignore a service requirement or an 
antifraud provision? These questions will then have to be answered.
  Finally, a Supreme Court ruling on a coercion test necessarily has 
broader implications for all Federal-State partnerships. The original 
Dole case was about transportation funding.
  A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the States will necessarily bring 
into question every agreement between the Federal Government and the 
States where the Federal Government conditions 100 percent of the 
Federal funds on States meeting requirements that are determined in 
Washington, DC.
  It is certainly possible that such a Supreme Court ruling could 
require future Congresses to carefully consider a coercion test in 
designing legislation.
  A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the States in this case could not 
only jeopardize the mandated Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care 
Act but could challenge the fundamental structure of Medicaid and have 
broader implications outside health care.
  One may ask: Does the Supreme Court have this case before it--and why 
does it have it before it?--a case with such broad and far-reaching 
implications? It is because of a massive restructuring of our health 
care system in a partisan fashion, using nearly every procedural tool 
at the majority party's disposal in accomplishing the goal of passage.
  The constitutionality of this law has been challenged in numerous 
courts throughout the country. These challenges will soon be heard 
before the Supreme Court. While most people want to focus on the 
individual mandate, it is important we do not forget the potential 
consequence of the Medicaid question before the Court.
  It could, obviously, strike the expansion in the Affordable Care Act. 
It could hamstring future Congresses as they consider potential 
policies for the Medicaid Program in the future. It could threaten the 
fundamental structure of the Medicaid Program by bringing into question 
all the requirements on the States in the program today. It could 
require future Congresses to consider the structure of every Federal-
State partnership.
  We are here discussing this because the White House and the 
Democratic majority put their partisan goals ahead of collaboration 
with Republicans and States to build legitimate public policy--contrary 
to how most social policy in this country has been devised: Social 
Security, bipartisan; Medicare, Medicaid, bipartisan; civil rights 
laws, bipartisan--but not this Affordable Care Act, a partisan 
document.
  Now we see that far more than this one specific policy is threatened. 
If the Supreme Court accepts the States' argument, a host of 
constitutional questions will surround the operation of many Federal 
funding streams to the States. It would be difficult to overstate the 
significance of such a ruling. I have outlined it was not necessary for 
the Congress to have taken action that might produce that result.
  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet.) Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

             REPEALING THE JOB-KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. JOHN B. LARSON

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 19, 2011

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to add one more 
story to this debate to help illustrate why the Affordable Care Act is 
so important. One of my constituents recently wrote to tell me that his 
19 year old son has a rare liver disease and that his only hope is a 
transplant. Under the new healthcare reform law, he is now able to keep 
his son on his insurance plan to age 26. His household would be out of 
luck without healthcare reform as last year his son's health care costs 
exceeded $120,000.
  It is stories like these that are the essence of why passing health 
reform was so important. It provides protections to ensure that someone 
like my constituent can access health care and not face exorbitant 
personal costs when an illness strikes.
  I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this repeal legislation and 
hope we can all work together to find ways to move our country forward.

                          ____________________

  TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO ALLOW AGENCIES TO FIGHT FRAUD, WASTE, AND 
                     ABUSE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JIM McDERMOTT

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, January 9, 2014

  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce two technical 
corrections to the Affordable Care Act. These two bills provide minor 
technical corrections to avoid confusion and to ensure that regulators 
can effectively do their work in combatting fraud, waste, and abuse in 
the Medicare program. We need to extend the solvency of the Medicare 
program and to do so, we must ensure that the regulatory agencies are 
empowered to fully enforce provision to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse 
in the Medicare program.
  The first bill would allow certain physician extenders, including 
physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and clinical nurse 
specialists, to document that the face-to-face encounter required by 
the Affordable Care Act has occurred. The Affordable Care Act currently 
requires that a physician document that a face-to-face encounter has 
occurred, even though the law allows the face-to-face encounter to be 
performed by a physician extender. The face-to-face encounter is an 
important tool to combat fraud and abuse in the durable medical 
equipment context, and it is important to recognize the role that 
physician extenders play in many instances.
  The second bill would correct an error in the ACA that was carried 
over from an underlying law, which prevents regulators from stopping 
waste, fraud, and abuse. A provision in the Affordable Care Act 
intended to allow regulators additional discretion to impose a surety 
bond on home health agencies based on the volume of payments they 
received from the Medicare program. However, due to a drafting error in 
the underlying law that was inadvertently perpetuated in the Affordable 
Care Act, the bond that regulators can require from home health 
agencies is essentially capped at $50,000. For large providers, this 
amount is too low a sum to have a meaningful impact and directly 
contradicts Congress' intention to require a higher bond from home 
health agencies that receive substantial Medicare payments.
  We must continue our efforts to extend the solvency of the Medicare 
program. Fighting fraud is a nonpartisan issue. I urge my colleagues to 
support these technical correction provisions.

              INTRODUCTION OF CHILD CARE AFFORDABILITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 18, 2012

  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, throughout the country, affordable and 
safe child care is essential for working families. According to the 
U.S. Census Bureau, more than 70 percent of children have one or more 
parents in the labor force. A survey commissioned by the National 
Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies revealed that 57 
percent of parents reported in 2010 that child care was a necessity, 
compared with 49 percent in 2006.
  Despite the great need for affordable child care, there is a wide gap 
between what today's families are earning and the cost of child care 
and household expenses. In 2010, the average cost of full-time care for 
an infant in a child care center varied from $4,650 in Mississippi to 
over $18,000 in the District of Columbia. In my own state of New York, 
the average yearly cost of part time care for a school-age child is an 
exorbitant $10,400. The amount of assistance offered by the current 
federal credit for child care costs is a minimum of only $600 for one 
child and $1,200 for two children. Unfortunately, this amount does 
little to offset our country's extraordinarily high child care costs. 
To ease the burden on our working families, today I am introducing the 
Child Care Affordability Act. This legislation would create a new tax 
deduction for child care and dependent care expenses and expand the 
current credit for child and dependent care expenses, so families 
receive a truly impactful level of assistance. Parents would be given 
the choice of utilizing the tax deduction or the tax credit to select 
the option that provides them with the greatest amount of relief.
  During tax season, it is important to offer working families who are 
struggling to afford child care.

  REPUBLICANS CONTINUE ASSAULT ON THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT ON 1-
                            YEAR ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the 1-year anniversary of the 
passage of the Affordable Health Care Act to voice my disappointment 
with my Republican colleagues' continued assault on the historic law 
that has already begun to provide aid and relief for countless 
Americans.
  One year ago, my colleagues and I came together to enact a law 
because of the call to action from our constituents. We heard from 
seniors who could not afford their prescriptions and were in the 
Medicaid doughnut hole, parents whose children were being denied 
coverage due to preexisting conditions, individuals who were being 
denied treatment due to lifetime limits, and taxpayers who are bearing 
the costs of uncompensated health care.
  We answered the clarion call from our constituents who asked us to 
protect them. Yet the Republican colleagues continue to assault the 
law. Siding the special interests, particularly the health care 
insurance companies that stand to lose from health care reform, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to assault our 
program.
  With that, I say let's keep the law in force and let's move forward 
with progress.

      HONORING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO PROVIDE HOSPICE CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today on Capitol Hill there are hundreds 
of nurses, chaplains and social workers, the people who deliver hospice 
care at the bedside, here to promote an honest discussion and careful 
analysis of how to help individuals and their families grapple with the 
final chapter of life. It may be the hardest issue in health care, and 
the fear that it invokes can be a powerful weapon.
  For most of us, the majority of health care we receive in our 
lifetime will be administered in those last few months. It's when we 
need the most doctors and nursing care, medical procedures and 
oftentimes in hospitals.
  But we know from scientific studies that when patients are educated 
about their treatment options, they make decisions that are not only 
aligned with their personal preferences, but shared decision-making 
relieves stress and anxiety. Ironically, sometimes getting less 
intensive help, like in a hospice, not only improves the quality of 
life, these patients, many of them actually live longer.
  From a public policy perspective, it's perverse that Medicare will 
pay for almost any medical procedure, yet not reimburse doctors to have 
a thoughtful conversation to prepare patients and their families for 
the delicate, complex, and emotionally demanding decisions surrounding 
the end of life.
  That's why I sought to direct Medicare, in the Affordable Care Act, 
to cover a voluntary discussion with the doctor about living wills, 
power of attorney, and end-of-life preferences. Helping patients and 
their families clarify what they want and need should be an element of 
any rational, comprehensive health care system.
  Despite our recent history, it's also a rare common denominator in 
health care politics because it's something that most people actually 
agree on. In fact, the majority of my Republican colleagues supported a 
similar provision for terminally ill elderly patients that was part of 
the 2003 prescription drug bill.
  I had a friend of mine, a Republican cardiovascular surgeon here in 
the House, who told me he had many end-of-life conversations; but, 
unfortunately, they were often too late. He wished he could have spoken 
to patients and their families when they could have properly reflected, 
not just when the surgery was merely hours away.
  During the early debates on the Affordable Care Act, I was confident 
that this was an area where we were making a contribution to improve 
the quality of health care, but it actually might be something that 
would bring us together because of the shared agreement. But, 
unfortunately, battle lines were drawn; and you know how the rest of 
that story went: death panels, rationing, forced consultation with 
government-appointed physicians.
  In war, truth is the first casualty. The same goes for politics. As a 
country, we have a difficult time talking rationally and thoughtfully 
about end-of-life issues. That's why it's so important that we have 
these dedicated people on Capitol Hill today--the nurses, the hospice 
workers, the social workers--to have this thoughtful conversation from 
people who do it every day. Their work to help patients and families 
can help Congress understand that the work is not finished.
  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the Personalize Your Health 
Care Act, H.R. 1589. Join me in making sure that the Federal Government 
is a better partner in helping families prepare for this difficult 
chapter.

                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, 2 years ago President Obama signed into 
law what I believe was the most forward-thinking and humane reform of 
our health care system since Medicare. Just like the Republicans 
opposed Medicare when it came in, they still want to get rid of it. If 
we look at the Ryan budget that came out, what do they want to do? They 
want to privatize Medicare. They have been at it ever since. They do 
not want this humane reform we passed 2 years ago.
  When the affordable care act became law, I said we have made America 
a more compassionate and a more just society. I believe this with even 
greater conviction now. In listening to my colleagues, my friends on 
the other side of the aisle, one would think this is all just about 
little nuts and bolts and this and that, but it is about humaneness. It 
is about compassion and about justice and, yes, it is about making the 
system work better for patients, not just for insurance companies and 
the insurance industry.
  Now that we have moved ahead to implement the law, the results have 
been striking. Every American now is protected against the abusive 
insurance company practices of the past. Let me put it another way. 
Because of the health care reform law, Americans now have protections 
that every Senator in this Chamber has enjoyed for years under the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. We now have extended that to 
all Americans. Listening to my friends on the other side of the aisle, 
they want to take it away from Americans but keep it for themselves. 
Oh, no; they do not want to give it up. I think what is good for 
Senators ought to be good for the American people.
  The young lady shown on this chart is Emily Schlichting. She 
testified before my committee last year, and this is what she said:

       Young people are the future of this country and we are the 
     most affected by reform--we're the generation that is most 
     uninsured. We need the Affordable Care Act because it is 
     literally an investment in the future of this country.

  Why does she say that? Because she suffers from a rare autoimmune 
condition which insurance companies would not even cover. But because 
we have said they cannot now discriminate if someone has a preexisting 
condition, Emily gets insurance coverage. Plus, she can stay on her 
parents' health insurance program.
  So far, the law has extended coverage to more than 2\1/2\ million 
young people such as Emily. Yet the Republicans want to take it away. 
They want to take away Emily Schlichting's insurance coverage. That is 
what this is all about. They want to repeal the affordable care act--
ObamaCare. What that will mean is that 2\1/2\ million people similar to 
Emily will lose their insurance. But they do not talk about that. They 
do not talk about that.
  Here is the coverage Americans have right now. We have banned 
lifetime limits. Let me tell everyone about Ross Daniels and Amy Ward 
from West Des Moines, IA. After developing a rare lung infection on a 
summer trip, Amy needed intensive treatment, including a course of 
medication costing--get this--$1,600 a dose--$1,600 a dose. Her 
insurance policy had a $1 million lifetime limit. Without our health 
care reform's ban on lifetime limits, this couple would have had to 
declare bankruptcy. After this experience, Ross said he can't 
understand why opponents of the law want to repeal it. He said:

       It is hard for us to believe that so many of the GOP 
     candidates would have us go back in time where an illness 
     like this would have forced us, or any other family for that 
     matter, into bankruptcy.

  Listen to what Republicans are saying. They want to take this 
protection away from Amy Ward and Ross Daniels and millions of other 
Americans. There are 100 million people being helped by the ban on 
lifetime limits.
  We have also covered vital preventive services free of charge. That 
has benefited more than 80 million people who

[[Page S1883]]

now get free preventive care. It allows young people to remain on their 
parents' insurance plans until they are age 26. I can't tell you how 
many families I have talked to in my State of Iowa who have said this 
has been a godsend to them and to their kids.
  Here is the preventive portion. We all know prevention is the best 
thing we can do to change our sick care system into a health care 
system. Here is what we did. Here is what the affordable care act does 
on prevention. Before health care reform, colorectal cancer screening 
was covered only 68 percent by insurance companies, cholesterol 
screening was only covered by 57 percent, tobacco cessation only 4 
percent. Under the affordable care act, colorectal cancer screening, 
cholesterol, and tobacco cessation all are covered at 100 percent by 
every insurance company. Madam President, 100 hundred percent, not 57 
percent or 68 percent but 100 percent. We all know that early screening 
means people live longer and it cuts down on health care costs.
  So millions now receive free preventive care, and 86 million 
Americans had at least one free preventive service in 2011. Almost 1 
million Iowans, in my State, received at least one free preventive 
service in 2011. Yet Republicans want to take this away. That is what 
this is about.
  But Americans now have preventive care. They now are able to keep 
their kids on their policies until they are age 26. They now have a ban 
on lifetime limits. We now have a ban for children up to age 19 on 
preexisting conditions. That is all they want to do; they want to take 
this away. I say, don't let them take this away from the American 
people.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 50 seconds 
remaining.
  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from 
Michigan.

 INTRODUCING H.R. 5126, ``HELPING SAVE AMERICANS' HEALTH CARE CHOICES 
                                 ACT''

  (Mr. FLEMING asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced H.R. 5126, the 
Helping Save Americans' Health Care Choices Act.
  This important legislation restores the popular Health Savings 
Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts, which are diminished through 
taxation and restrictions under ObamaCare.
  Millions of Americans rely on HSAs to cover deductibles, insurance 
copayments, over-the-counter medications, and a plethora of other 
medical expenses. Furthermore, it is an excellent tool to cut health 
care costs while ObamaCare, itself, provides no such tools. I find it 
extremely ironic that the name of the current law, the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, betrays the fact that it drives up 
costs for patients and for their employers.
  If you truly support health care affordability, I ask all of you to 
support H.R. 5126, which restores this valuable tool that saves costs.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 24, 2010

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Preservation 
of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act.
  This important legislation will ensure that Medicare and TRICARE 
beneficiaries will be able to keep their doctors by retroactively 
reversing a 21 percent decrease in physician reimbursement that 
occurred on June 1, 2010. Additionally, this measure would provide 
physicians a 2.2 percent increase in physician reimbursements through 
November 30, 2010.
  While I am pleased that the House is considering a 6 month fix, I 
continue to support a permanent solution. It is not fair to medical 
providers to face the continued uncertainty of temporary fixes. I am 
proud that I supported and the House passed a permanent fix last 
November, and would urge my colleagues in both the House and Senate to 
recommit themselves to passing legislation to permanently fix this 
problem.

                        Thursday, June 24, 2010

  Mrs. MALONEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3962, which 
will protect patient access to their doctors and prevent a 21 percent 
cut in Medicare payments to doctors, and also boost physician payments 
by 2.2 percent through November 30.
  Congress has spent the last decade--under both Republican and 
Democratic leadership--overriding the Sustainable Growth Rate, SGR, 
formula to prevent America's doctors from facing pay cuts in Medicare 
and to ensure seniors can keep their doctor.
  Last November, the House passed H.R. 3961, the Medicare Physician 
Payment Reform Act, permanently fixing the SGR. Democrats have long 
recognized that this formula is fundamentally flawed and have been 
working to fix it only to be stymied by Republicans in the Senate. This 
bill, though necessary, will require Congress to review the formula 
again in December when the current fix expires.
  Temporary fixes are not the answer. We must have a permanent solution 
to this problem to protect our Medicare patients and retired military 
veterans.
  I urge my colleagues to work toward a permanent fix of the 
Sustainable Growth Rate.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the majority 
leader, this is a good example of bipartisanship. I think we have come 
up with a proposal and achieved a goal that both sides wanted to 
achieve, which is to get a doctor fix for at least a 6-month period of 
time. Also, it is paid for. So we have done it without adding to the 
deficit, and I think that is something both sides can feel good about.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.
  Mr. REID. Mr. President, sometimes the Senate can be terribly 
disconcerting and aggravating, but that is the way the Senate is. Those 
are the rules we work under. I love the Senate. Every day that goes by, 
I understand there are times I am aggravated and disconcerted, but the 
vast majority of the time I am amazed how we are able to get work done.
  I say through the Presiding Officer to my friend, the Republican 
leader, I am glad we were able to work out this legislation. This is 
extremely important for everybody, and we are going to move on with the 
rest of the bill and try to finish that as early as possible.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.
  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate this development. 
This is very important. Now doctors will be paid. More important, 
seniors will get the benefits they deserve. Payments under TRICARE will 
now go out. Military who participate in TRICARE, the retired military 
program, will get their benefits because that is all tied together. It 
is important because this provision expired June 1, this month, and it 
is about the last day for the payments to be paid; otherwise, there 
would be a 21-percent reduction in payments to physicians, and many 
providers would not provide the services to seniors, or even Medicaid, 
for that matter. So it is very important that we are taking this action 
this day; otherwise, there would be near chaos in the absence of 
medical care and procedures.
  I appreciate the cooperation on both sides of the aisle in working 
this out. This is all paid for. This is not deficit

[[Page S5151]]

spending, which I think is critical to many. Third, it is a good omen. 
I hope we can take this cooperation and work out the rest of the so-
called extenders bill together on both sides of the aisle. I am very 
pleased with this development. I thank the majority leader and the 
minority leader for working this out. Now we can put this issue aside 
and doctors will be paid, seniors will get the benefits they deserve, 
and we can go on to work cooperatively to finalize the rest of the 
bill.
  I thank my friend.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.
  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this year has been an extremely difficult 
year. No one has been more involved in everything we have done here 
than my friend from Montana. In true times of crisis--and we have had 
plenty of crises in the last 18 months, and he and I had a relationship 
before that. In the last 18 months, we were in the trenches together to 
work through some big problems we have here legislatively. Because of 
his responsibility as chairman of the Finance Committee, much of the 
burden of what goes on in the Senate is on his shoulders. He has broad 
shoulders and a wonderful staff. I enjoy working with him, and I enjoy 
his friendship.

          STATEMENT ON: AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JAY INSLEE

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 01, 2009

  Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the 
Affordable Health Care for America Act. Today marks an historic day for 
the health of all Americans. Today, this Congress joins with the 
American people to say that health care is not only a policy issue, but 
an issue of morality; and no longer will the conscience of this country 
allow Americans to go without access to affordable, comprehensive 
health care coverage. I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and the House 
leadership for their steadfast determination; and Chairmen Rangel, 
Miller, and particularly Chairman Waxman of the Energy and Commerce 
committee on which I am proud to sit, for their thoughtful leadership 
on this issue.
  Access to affordable health care has the power to break the shackles 
imposed on Americans today who are fearful of leaving their job, 
starting a new business, or going to the doctor due to their lack of 
coverage. In my district alone, this bill has the power to provide 
coverage for 30,000 uninsured residents; improve employer-coverage for 
524,000 residents; provide credits to help pay for coverage for up to 
120,000 households; improve Medicare for 84,000 beneficiaries, 
including closing the prescription drug donut hole for 7,400 seniors; 
allow 20,000 small businesses to obtain affordable health care coverage 
and provide tax credits to help reduce health insurance costs for up to 
18,600 small businesses. Additionally, this legislation will protect up 
to 1,100 families from bankruptcy due to unaffordable health care 
costs; and reduce the cost of uncompensated care for hospitals and 
health care providers by $28 million.
  As a member of the Energy and Commerce committee I was able to fight 
to include several provisions that will improve access to affordable 
health care in Washington state, the most important of which is 
President Obama's public health insurance option. Like our President, I 
believe that it is important to protect the interest of the consumer by 
providing choices so that people may decide which health insurance 
solution works best for them and their family. That is one reason I am 
a strong advocate of a public health insurance option. The President's 
public health insurance option will be offered in a health insurance 
exchange, created in this bill, alongside coverage sold by private 
insurers; thereby using natural market competition to control the 
rising cost of health coverage while protecting consumer choice. The 
implementation of this exchange will make insurance affordable for an 
additional 36 million Americans, raising the share of legal, nonelderly 
residents with health insurance coverage from 83 percent to 96 percent. 
The public insurance option will bring competition to the marketplace 
and consumer interests will be protected by addressing affordability 
and access issues that plague our current system.
  Washington state is a leader in high-quality, efficient health care. 
Our doctors and hospitals produce some of the country's best health 
care outcomes. We have a culture of medicine that places emphasis on 
patient safety, outcomes, and care. And yet for decades we have been 
penalized for our efficiency by receiving lower reimbursement rates per 
service under the Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement model. On 
average our providers are reimbursed fifteen to fifty percent less per 
service than their counterparts in other parts of the country. The 
reason for this discrepancy is that our statewide efficiency gives the 
appearance that it merely costs less to deliver care in the state 
because our overall patient costs are lower.
  Opponents have argued that practice expenses vary by geography. But, 
on November 5, 2009, the American Medical Association (AMA) released 
the results of its 2007-2008 study that included physician practice 
expense information from over seventy medical specialty societies and 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician Practice 
Information (PPI) survey. The results of the study showed that expenses 
did not differ significantly by either metro location or census region 
and reconfirmed what providers in Washington state have know for 
decades--that the Medicare physician payment formula is flawed.
  To this end, I was honored to be one of eight Members chosen by 
Speaker Pelosi to negotiate a resolution to this geographic disparity 
issue that has plagued our country for decades. The result, after four 
months of negotiations, is an agreement that will move the nation to a 
system that rewards high quality, cost-effective care; reimbursing for 
the value rather than the volume of services. It will fix existing 
Medicare geographic payment inequities and will cover both physician 
and hospital payments. This will provide an historic transformation of 
the Medicare payment system to ensure better care for patients and 
reduce health care costs over the long term.
  The first part of the agreement addresses the geographic variation in 
the rates doctors are paid per service. The bill instructs the 
Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct a study to evaluate and make 
recommendations to improve the geographic adjustment factors in the 
Medicare reimbursement formulas which will be completed one year after 
enactment. The Secretary of HHS will then implement a new Medicare 
payment rate that takes into account the IOM recommendations. An 
initial investment of $4 billion per year in 2012 and 2013 is allocated 
to make payment rate adjustments. After 2013 reimbursement adjustments 
will become budget neutral.
  Geographic variation in the utilization of services is addressed in 
the second IOM study on high value care. The IOM will make 
recommendations on how to transform the Medicare payment system to 
reward value and quality of care. Value is defined as the efficient 
delivery of high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered care. The 
study will be completed by April 15, 2011. No later than ninety days 
after the report is completed, the Secretary of HHS will submit to 
Congress a preliminary implementation plan based on the IOM study, 
which MedPac and GAO will evaluate within forty-five days. The IOM's 
quality and value-based payment recommendations will automatically go 
into effect unless the House and Senate pass joint resolutions of 
disapproval by May 31, 2012. The goal was to finish all studies and 
changes before the public option goes into effect in 2013 so the 
recommendations would be incorporated.

[[Page E2859]]

  This deal is a real victory for Washington state. Correcting the 
fundamental inequalities in Medicare reimbursement rates that underpay 
Washington state physicians will ensure access to Medicare physicians 
for Washington state seniors and Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, 
this provision sets in motion a fundamental shift in the way we will 
reimburse for medical care going forward; moving away from a fee-for-
service model and towards an outcome-based model. This shift will 
provide real cost containment by incentivizing and reimbursing for the 
quality, not the quantity, of medical care across the United States; 
saving the country billions of dollars.
  A compounded issue resulting from Medicare reimbursement disparity is 
the reliance on Medicare Advantage plans by Medicare beneficiaries in 
low cost areas. Medicare Advantage plans in Washington state have 
played a critical role in providing seniors with access to care because 
they have been able to reimburse providers at a higher rate than 
traditional Medicare, thereby attracting providers into the network who 
would otherwise be unable to treat Medicare beneficiaries due to cost. 
It is for this reason that I fought tirelessly to ensure a quality 
bonus for high-quality, efficient Medicare Advantage plans. Under the 
language I negotiated in the House bill, four-star rated plans and 
above, in the bottom thirty percent of costs to the system, would be 
eligible for a 1.5 percent bonus in 2011; a 3.0 percent bonus in 2012; 
and a 5.0 percent bonus for each subsequent year. These bonus payments 
will ensure the continuation of high quality health care for Medicare 
Advantage recipients in Washington state.
  Washington state is not only a leader in patient care, but also in 
medical innovation. The biotech industry is an important health care 
partner in Washington state. Across the state roughly 1,060 biotech 
companies employ 23,047 Washingtonians. The state ranks eighth in 
National Institute of Health grants and in the past two years academic 
bioscience research expenditures totaled $685 million. The innovation 
occurring in the state has lead to some of the leading biologic 
therapies for life-threatening illnesses such as cancer, multiple 
sclerosis, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and many serious rare diseases.
  Biologics are living organisms, different and more complex than small 
molecule drugs. Biotech medicines can be determined to be the ``same'' 
as the original drug, but science is not yet at a point where they can 
be determined to be ``identical.'' And even small differences between a 
copy and an original biologic can cause differences in effectiveness, 
and, in some cases, serious side effects. Therefore it is necessary 
that policy reflect the uniqueness of these therapies, and ensure drug 
efficacy and patient safety. I believe a pathway for the approval of 
biosimilar biologics is the critical next step to providing patients 
with increased access to lifesaving therapies. I also believe that we 
can create a pathway that provides patients with lower-cost medicine 
without sacrificing safety or eliminating incentives to create 
breakthrough medicines.
  This is why I, joined by my fellow committee members Anna Eshoo and 
Joe Barton, introduced H.R. 1548, the Pathway for Biosimilars Act. The 
legislation protects patients by ensuring patient safety, recognizing 
the scientific differences between small-molecule drugs and biologics, 
maintaining the physician-patient relationship, and preserving 
incentives for innovation. I was proud to co-sponsor an amendment in 
the Energy and Commerce Committee markup of H.R. 3200 that incorporated 
key pieces of our legislation. The amendment includes twelve years of 
data exclusivity for innovator biologics, ensuring not only that these 
life-changing and life-saving biologic treatments are more accessible 
and affordable, but that we also foster continued research and 
development investment needed to search for new cures and treatments. 
The strong bipartisan votes in both the House and Senate on this issue 
demonstrate that Congress is committed to a fair and safe pathway for 
biosimilars. I commend the House for adopting my legislation as part of 
HR 3962, and it is my sincere hope that it will be included in the 
final conference agreement.
  A few other provisions that I want to highlight are great examples of 
how Washington state's health care leadership has helped shape federal 
health care legislation. Earlier this year the state passed a common 
sense law that will save billions of dollars in administrative health 
care costs by standardizing insurance claims and forms processes, and I 
was proud to fight for the inclusion of similar language in the 
Affordable Health Care for America Act. Washington state has also been 
innovative in health care plan structures allowing for the emergence of 
direct primary care medical home plans that provide low cost coverage 
of primary care services. This model has granted access to care for a 
population that has been shut out from traditional health care coverage 
due to high costs. I was grateful to see the inclusion of this coverage 
model in the health care reform legislation. I am proud to represent a 
district and state that is leading the way on health care policy.
  Once again I would like thank Speaker Pelosi and the House leadership 
for their continued determination that brought all facets of the 
Democratic Caucus to the table and ensured that each member had a voice 
in the debate. As a result the House of Representatives has produced a 
health care reform bill that will provide access to affordable health 
care and bend the cost curve; and I am once again proud to offer my 
support.

                               speech of

                         HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN

                            of rhode island

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3962, the 
Affordable Health Care for America Act. Congress has made unprecedented 
strides this year in the fight to reform our nation's health insurance 
system and provide coverage to all Americans, and today's vote 
represents a historic culmination of these vast, collaborative efforts. 
This transformative bill offers real solutions for Rhode Islanders by 
providing better access to affordable, quality health care coverage and 
finally puts America back on the path to an efficient and sustainable 
health care system.
  This summer, I traveled across the district to meet with Rhode 
Islanders and discuss health reform. I met with constituents who had 
health insurance all their lives, but then lost it when they were 
diagnosed with cancer. I met with small business owners who provided 
coverage for their employees for decades, but were forced to 
discontinue it when they could no longer keep up with skyrocketing 
costs. And I met with parents who were desperate to protect their 
childrens' health, but feared they would soon run up against lifetime 
insurance caps.
  All of these stories conveyed the same message--health care costs in 
the United States are rising at an unsustainable rate, and they are 
placing a huge burden on Rhode Island families, employers and health 
care providers. This year alone, over 13,000 Rhode Islanders lost their 
insurance coverage due to rising unemployment. And those who still have 
coverage are struggling with rising premiums, co-pays and crushing 
medical debt. Meanwhile, yearly double-digit premium increases are 
forcing businesses to choose between keeping their employees' health 
coverage and keeping their employees.
  As a longtime advocate of universal health care, I made a promise to 
my constituents to change the status quo of health care in America. The 
time for inaction is over--we must join together to pass this bill.
  H.R. 3962 will institute the changes we need to provide more security 
and stability to Americans who have health insurance, guarantee 
insurance to the millions who don't, and lower health care costs for 
our families, businesses and the government.
  This legislation builds on the strengths of our current employer-
based system by encouraging businesses who offer their own coverage to 
continue doing so. Americans who don't have coverage through their 
employer will be able to shop for their choice of a health plan through 
a new ``health insurance exchange,'' modeled after the tried and 
true Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which successfully 
provides coverage for over 9 million federal employees, retirees and 
their dependents.

  Unlike the limited options that are available to most consumers 
today, the exchange will

[[Page E2831]]

provide a more convenient, transparent and affordable way to choose 
among a variety of health plans that meets individual needs. Americans 
who cannot afford to purchase coverage within the exchange will receive 
financial assistance to ensure that they can obtain comprehensive 
coverage. Additionally, small businesses will receive tax credits that 
will make it more affordable to offer insurance to their employees.
  I am also pleased that this bill encourages competition by ensuring 
that Americans will have the ability to choose a public plan 
alternative. Unlike private insurance carriers, the public option will 
not be obligated by big profits for shareholders or large salaries for 
CEOs. And while it represents just one option for the consumer and one 
component of health care reform, it will serve as an important tool to 
increase choice and competition and lower overall insurance costs.
  Included in this proposal are a number of important health consumer 
protections. It will finally end insurance discrimination against 
people with pre-existing conditions and prevent insurance companies 
from imposing lifetime limits or dropping coverage when people are sick 
and need it most. It will cap out-of-pocket expenses so people don't go 
broke when they get sick; eliminate extra charges for preventive care 
like mammograms and diabetes tests; and protect Medicare for seniors 
while working to eliminate the ``donut-hole'' gap in coverage for 
prescription drugs. It will also require that insurers reinvest at 
least 85 percent of their premiums back into health coverage. This will 
limit the amount of money spent on advertising, underwriting, overhead 
and profits that do nothing but reduce health benefits for patients.
  Improving access to coverage will also require investments in our 
health care workforce. Our system is strained by a lack of nurses and 
primary care physicians, particularly in underserved areas. That is why 
our bill contains important workforce development initiatives like new 
scholarships and loan repayment programs, grant programs for primary 
care training and immediate financial support for community health 
centers. This will strengthen the number of nurses, doctors and other 
health care professionals necessary to meet the increased demand for 
services.
  This bill also makes historic changes to our antitrust laws by 
removing exemption enjoyed by insurance companies so that they are no 
longer shielded from liability for price fixing or dominating their 
market--all of which reduce competition and increase prices for 
consumers. It establishes new grant programs designed to encourage 
states to implement alternatives to traditional medical malpractice 
litigation with the goal of reducing frivolous lawsuits while allowing 
legitimate cases to be heard. This bill also has my strong support 
because every portion will be completely paid for, and it will reduce 
the deficit by $109 billion over the next ten years.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe it is incumbent on us as policymakers to offer 
a new vision for health care in America--one that contains costs, 
improves quality, increases efficiency, promotes wellness, puts health 
care decisions back in the hands of patients and doctors, and 
guarantees coverage as a right to our citizens.
  Every American deserves the promise of quality, affordable health 
care. I urge my colleagues to join me in fulfilling that promise today, 
and support the Affordable Health Care for America Act.

                               speech of

                           HON. MARCY KAPTUR

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Stupak-Ellsworth-
Pitts-Smith-Kaptur-Dahlkemper Amendment that maintains existing Federal 
law on the compelling issue of abortion. For 34 years, citizens of 
conscience on all sides have weighed in on this important moral and 
legal question. Lawmakers have attempted to accommodate very divergent 
views, even on the meaning of life itself. Many lives must be 
considered--the life of the mother, the life of the child, including 
the unborn but conceived, and in my opinion the rarely mentioned 
responsibilities of the father as well.
  Our legislative struggle to do what is proper is rooted in 
interrelated moral, scientific, legal, and yes, theological 
dissonances. What is right? What should be legal? And what will lead to 
a just and responsible society for all? I continue to approach this 
deeply moving issue as a representative from a widely diverse 
Congressional district in northwestern Ohio, an area of our Nation 
comprised of people from many different ethnicities, races, faiths, 
denominations and belief systems. My representation of these varying 
views embodies the deepest respect for all our people, and for the 
integrity with which they have arrived at their values.
  This amendment reaffirms longstanding, existing law, and nothing 
more. It represents the broad consensus of the American people after 
decades of consideration on the issue. Recent Gallup polls show that 51 
percent of Americans consider themselves ``pro-life'' on the issue of 
abortion. But, this amendment does not resolve all moral questions that 
face pro choice, prolife, and non-aligned Americans on this issue. All 
it does is restate existing law.
  It states that no Federal funds ``authorized under this Act may be 
used to pay for any abortion, or to cover any part of the costs of any 
health plan that includes coverage of abortion,'' except in the cases 
of the life of the mother, rape or incest.
  Effectively, the precedent setting Hyde amendment--which has been in 
effect for 34 years in our Nation--will apply to the public option, and 
to any Federal plans which include elective abortion. The amendment 
does no more, and no less. Further, with the added coverage for all 
Americans that this bill provides, perhaps the abortion choice will 
become less attractive for those faced with such a life wrenching 
choice.
  This amendment will not bar any one from purchasing their own private 
supplemental rider. Our language is the same that applies in current 
law on Medicaid, Medicare, the Children's Health Insurance Plan, and 
the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, FEHBP, itself which offers 
many private insurance plans. The FEHBP is a model for how this 
language will be applied. It has been tried, tested, and proven.
  The inclusion of this amendment clarifies the bill's language on the 
potential fungibility of premium dollars deposited in Federal accounts 
that could result in federally sanctioned insurance paid for by taxes, 
premiums, or Federal subsidies diverted to pay for abortions by those 
who do not agree with the procedure.
  Importantly, for the first time, the base measure itself will help 
vast scores of women to obtain health coverage and, by so doing limit 
abortion by enhancing broad coverage options for women's and children's 
health. The rate of infant mortality, which is fueled by shamefully 
high rates of premature birth in the United States, shows us that we 
are not addressing the needs of mother's and their babies. Providing 
the necessary support for women is the answer. This bill will vastly 
improve preventive care, double funds available to community health 
centers including obstetric and gynecological care, and move America 
fully into this 21st century. No woman, no woman--including poor women, 
pregnant women, unemployed women, working women, single women, and 
nursing women--will be left out of health insurance coverage.
  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

                          ____________________

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Health Care for America Act 
will strengthen America and offer greater security to our workers, 
families, seniors and businesses. It will enhance our Nation's health 
care system, placing American healthcare consumers where they belong: 
at the heart of it. H.R. 3962 will improve quality, choice and 
competition, while cutting down fraud, waste and abuse, and lowering 
costs over the long term. It will strengthen Medicare, eliminate the 
Part D ``donut hole,'' improve access for lower income citizens so that 
Medicare is affordable for ALL seniors, and create new consumer 
protections for Medicare Advantage Plans. Discrimination for pre-
existing conditions, dropped coverage, and yearly or lifetime caps will 
no longer be tolerated. Co-pays and other cost-sharing for preventative 
services will be eliminated and annual caps on what an individual or a 
family pays out-of-pocket will be established.
  Since 1987, the cost of the average family health insurance policy 
has risen from 7 percent of median family income to 17 percent. Family 
premiums are projected to increase an average of $1,800 each year and 
in 2007, 60 percent of bankruptcies were reported to be related to 
medical costs. With this bill, no American family will go bankrupt 
because they get sick.
  Sixty percent of our Nation's entire uninsured population are small 
business owners and their employees and families. This equals at least 
28 million uninsured Americans. Small business premiums have risen 129 
percent since 2000. In 2008, 38 percent of small companies offered 
health coverage, compared with 41 percent in 2007 and 61 percent in 
1993.
  For too long, the health of our Nation has dwindled while the pockets 
of the insurance giants have thickened. Our seniors have compromised 
prescription drugs for necessary groceries, while the pharmaceutical 
industry has made record profits. Hard working families have watched 
their savings plummet and their homes foreclosed after unexpected 
illnesses. Women with breast cancer, men with heart disease and 
children with leukemia or childhood diabetes have been flat-out denied 
health insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions or reaching 
insurance policy caps.
  Under the House Plan, the Ninth Congressional District of Ohio, the 
region I represent, will benefit immensely and in very specific ways:
  386,000 residents will see improved employer-based coverage
  167,000 households would be eligible for credits to help pay for 
coverage
  38,000 uninsured citizens just in our region would be eligible for 
insurance under a reformed system
  14,500 small businesses will be allowed to obtain affordable health 
care coverage and 12,400 among them will receive tax credits to help 
reduce the costs of health insurance
  102,000 beneficiaries will benefit from an improved Medicare program
  7,600 seniors will benefit from closing the prescription drug donut 
hole, starting with $500 of cost forgiveness in 2010
  1,700 families will be protected from bankruptcy due to unaffordable 
health care costs
  $120 million in savings will be seen by hospitals and health care 
providers as a result of reductions in uncompensated care.
  Under this bill, immediately, the uninsured and seniors will receive 
relief through a temporary insurance program. Individuals receiving 
COBRA will be allowed to keep their coverage until a more customer 
friendly, one-stop marketplace for health insurance, known as the 
Exchange, is created. The Exchange will offer affordability credits and 
tax credits for individuals and businesses that need them. Health plans 
will be required to allow young people until their 27th birthday to 
remain on their parents' health insurance policy. Moreover, insurance 
companies will be subject to public review and disclosure of insurance 
excessive rate increases.
  Much needed investments will be made right away in training programs 
designed to increase the number of primary care doctors, nurses, and 
public health professionals. Not-for-Profit purchasing collaboratives, 
such as the FrontPath Health Coalition from Northwest Ohio, will be 
strengthened to achieve careful plan management and cost-savings, and 
encouraged as a central provision of Title I. Community Health Centers 
will see an increase in funding to allow for a doubling of patients 
over the next 5 years. A $10 billion fund will be created to finance a 
temporary reinsurance program to help offset the costs of expensive 
health claims for employers that provide health benefits for retirees 
age 55-64.
  The well being of individuals and our nation will benefit from these 
reforms. From an economic standpoint, healthcare costs have stifled the 
vitality of American businesses and their ability to compete in the 
global marketplace. The 129 percent increase since 2000 in small 
business premiums alone have smothered their potential and destroyed 
their ability to cover employees, resulting in an astounding 60 percent 
of our Nation's entire uninsured population.
  Affordable health insurance reform is necessary to cut the costs of 
doing business, reduce the share of government expenditures spent on 
health care, help our companies to be more competitive in the world 
market, unleash the entrepreneurial talents of the American people, and 
give peace of mind to the middle class and our seniors and others that 
everything they have worked for will not be taken away if they get 
sick.
  As someone who grew up in a small business family, I watched our 
father forced to sell our small family grocery when he became ill. He 
needed health insurance for our family and took a job at a local auto 
assembly plant to obtain it for his wife and children. I promised 
myself when I was elected to Congress that passing legislation to cover 
small business would be one of my top priorities. Finally, it has 
become possible to vote on a bill that will do this for millions of our 
fellow citizens.
  With the mounting economic strain on American families and the rising 
costs of health insurance to workers, businesses and federal budget, 
the status quo has proven itself unsustainable, fiscally irresponsible 
and morally unacceptable. The time has come for this historical change. 
I stand in support of its promise to the American people.

                         HON. DONNA F. EDWARDS

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3962, 
the Affordable Health Care for America Act because it eliminates the 
discriminatory insurance industry practice of charging women higher 
premium rates than male customers for the same insurance benefits. This 
practice, known as ``gender rating,'' leaves women burdened by higher 
insurance costs. In fact, women are charged 25-50 percent more than men 
for comparable insurance benefits. For decades, insurance underwriters 
have tried to justify this disparity by asserting that women use more 
health care, especially during child-bearing years. This claim is 
contradicted by the reality that many women are denied insurance 
coverage for maternity care and even denied coverage based on a history 
of prior pregnancies. Further, female nonsmokers pay more for health 
insurance than men who smoke. In a recent study, more than half of 
women (compared to 39 percent of men) reported delaying needed medical 
care due to cost. Gender rating is prohibited in the individual market 
in 10 States (Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, 
New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington). Two States 
have ``rate bands'' that allow 20 percent variation in charges (Vermont 
and New Mexico). Twelve States ban gender rating in the small group 
market, including my home State of Maryland (as well as California, 
Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, and Washington). H.R. 3962 ends the 
discriminatory practice of gender rating in all States and ensures that 
women and men are charged equitable prices for premiums.
  As a life-long advocate of women's rights and a domestic violence 
prevention advocate, I support this ban on gender rating and support 
equal access to the insurance market for women.

                       Tuesday, November 17, 2009

  Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I object to the anti-choice 
amendment brought forward by Reps. Bart Stupak and Joseph Pitts. The 
Stupak-Pitts amendment goes beyond the scope of current law and 
effectively prohibits private insurers in the health insurance Exchange 
from offering insurance plans with abortion provisions. This amendment 
prohibits the use of federal funds from covering any part of the costs 
of any health care plan that includes coverage of abortion coverage, 
even if federal dollars do not go towards an abortion procedure. This 
amendment truly undermines the spirit of health care reform by 
rationing women's care and taking away current benefits plans that 
include abortion coverage.
  This amendment strips women's legal right to abortion procedures and 
turns back the clock on decades of legal precedent and legislation.
  This is a procedure that some women must consider in the interest of 
their health. This is a choice that no one, not a Member of Congress, 
or government official should make for a woman. This is a woman's 
choice that must be preserved. A woman's reproductive choice has been 
recognized by the Supreme Court of this country, and honored by the 
citizens and lawmakers of this country.
  Please oppose this amendment and protect women's health.

         SUPPORT FOR THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. I rise today to commend those who have 
endeavored to improve the provision of quality, affordable health care 
for all Americans and to refute those who use scare tactics to derail 
essential health insurance reform.
  During the more than 12 hours of debate on the House floor on 
November 7, we heard a number of speeches from some forecasting various 
doom and gloom scenarios. Some of the material focused more on scaring 
the American public than on presenting actual facts. We heard 
preposterous stories of death panels and prisons, denial of care and 
dramatic cuts in services, but the purveyors of fear ignored the 
hundreds of groups across the Nation that saw through the scare tactics 
and who support responsible health insurance reform. Those groups 
aren't driven by partisan ideology. They're focused on the well-being 
of their members. I would like to highlight just a few.
  The scare tactic said this bill will harm seniors. In actuality, the 
Affordable Health Care for America Act will help seniors by closing the 
Medicare

[[Page H13008]]

part D prescription drug loophole that currently causes many seniors to 
pay thousands of dollars out of pocket, and it will help keep Medicare 
solvent and able to continue paying benefits well into the future. 
Without reform, Medicare part A will be insolvent by 2017. If we do 
nothing, Medicare hospital reimbursements will be cut by 2017. Without 
reform, premiums for Medicare part D doctor reimbursements are 
projected to increase an average of 8.5 percent every year through 
2013. That's why the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and 
Medicare supports this bill. The Alliance for Retired Americans and the 
Center for Medicare Advocacy both support this bill. The National 
Council on Aging and the Medicare Rights Center both support this bill, 
as does the AARP.
  The scare tactic said this bill would harm the ability of caregivers 
to provide lifesaving care. In actuality, doctors and medical providers 
know that this bill will preserve their ability to properly treat their 
patients and be fairly compensated. That's why the American Academy of 
Family Physicians and the Federation of American Hospitals support this 
bill. The American Academy of Physicians Assistants and the American 
College of Surgeons support this bill. The American Nurses Association 
and the American College of Physicians support this bill. And the 
American Medical Association supports this bill.
  The scare tactic says this bill will deny care to those with life-
threatening conditions, like cancer. In actuality, the Affordable 
Health Care for America Act will safeguard those with previous existing 
medical conditions and those in need of lifesaving procedures. That's 
why the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association 
support this bill. The American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network 
and the American Diabetes Association both support this bill. The 
Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities and the National Alliance on 
Mental Illness both support this bill. The National Breast Cancer 
Coalition and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance both support 
this bill, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America support this bill.
  The scare tactic said this will wreck the economy. In actuality, this 
bill will help businesses--especially small businesses--control the 
spiraling cost of health care in America. Mr. Speaker, the Business 
Roundtable recently released a report that found that without reform, 
by 2019, employer-based health insurance payments will rise 166 
percent. Without reform, those dramatic cost increases will endanger 
the economy, leaving employers and employees facing the untenable 
option of dropping coverage or laying off employees. The Business 
Roundtable's report found that the legislative reforms in the current 
health insurance bills could reduce employer costs by $3,000 per 
employee by 2019. That's why the Main Street Alliance supports the 
Affordable Health Care for America Act. The National Farmers Union 
supports the bill. The U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce supports the 
bill, as does the Small Business Majority.
  The scare tactics said that the American people would suffer. In 
actuality, consumer advocacy groups know that this bill will provide 
Americans with their choice of affordable health care options. That's 
why the Consumers Union supports it, the Consumer Health Coalition 
supports it, and the National Patient Advocate Foundation supports it.
  Mr. Speaker, there are hundreds more State and national organizations 
that refused to fall prey to diversionary scare tactics and supported 
this ground-breaking legislation on health care. The focus on these 
individual groups is disparate, but they share a common agenda with the 
majority of Americans and the majority of this House: Delivery now on 
the long overdue need for responsible health insurance reform.

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, tonight as we prepare to pass a historic 
health care bill that provides expanded health care coverage to 
Americans and is more than sixty years in the making, I am concerned 
that we must first fight to block a direct assault on a woman's right 
to choose.
  America's Affordable Health Choices Act is fair and equitable in its 
approach to abortion and respects the rights of those who want to 
purchase a plan that provides abortion coverage and those who do not. 
It guarantees that no public funds are used to pay for abortion 
services--codifying the long standing Hyde amendment.
  The anti-choice Stupak Amendment seeks to take away a woman's right 
to pay for her own abortion services, forcing millions of women to 
retreat to the shadows and an era in which back alley abortions were 
too often the norm. That is why I will stand up this evening and vote 
against the Stupak Amendment--ensuring that every woman in this country 
has the reproductive freedom that she desires and that her mother and 
mother's mother fought so hard for.

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have cast an historic vote 
to overhaul America's failing health care system today. Controlling 
escalating health care costs is essential to getting our nation's 
fiscal picture under control. For the first time in our country's 
history it has brought consumers, businesses and providers to the table 
in a united effort to control costs, make health care affordable and 
improve our health outcomes. I have always said that if you like your 
current health care you need to be in favor of reform because you will 
not be able to afford that same level of care if the status quo 
persists.
  H.R. 3962 prohibits exclusions based on preexisting conditions. It 
forbids the cancellation of your health care because you have suffered 
an illness or injury. It makes sure that everyone shares appropriately 
in the benefits and costs of affordable health care reform. Americans 
will no longer be one illness or job loss away from bankruptcy. It 
guarantees basic benefits for all Americans and allows competition 
across state lines to reduce costs.
  H.R. 3962 makes major reforms in our health care delivery system that 
we have not had the political courage to do for years. Major 
improvements in Medicare and Medicaid save over $400 billion while 
still expanding services to our seniors. I am pleased the House bill 
contains a section on Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). 
However, I believe the CER provisions contained within the bill could 
use significant improvement to ensure the research that is conducted is 
protected from undue political influence from the government. Earlier 
this year I introduced H.R. 2502, the Comparative Effectiveness 
Research Act of 2009. My bill reinforces a core principal of health 
care that patients and doctors should be making medical decisions. It 
would establish an independent institute charged with coordinating and 
guiding comparative effectiveness research programs. By streamlining 
access to the latest medical research, doctors can make sound decisions 
that will improve the health of their patients and ultimately lower 
costs by reducing the number of redundant and ineffective treatments. 
This is the approach that has guided CER efforts in the Senate and it 
is my intention to work closely with the House leadership and the 
conference committee to ensure any final compromise establishes a 
public-private institute outside of government to guide the research 
and ensure it will be independent, credible, and protected from 
political influence.
  It begins to emphasize, and pay for early, intervention and 
prevention to keep people healthy and reduce costs. H.R. 3962 puts $34 
billion is put into wellness and prevention programs and developing the 
primary care network needed to provide timely service to all Americans. 
Rural America also gets particular attention in the bill with loan 
forgiveness and incentive programs.
  America's senior citizens do particularly well under this 
legislation. In addition to modernizing and reducing costs, Medicare 
improvements allow seniors to keep more assets and still access 
subsidies. The new bill fixes the donut hole sooner and allows more 
drug price-

[[Page E2760]]

negotiation to ensure seniors are getting the best prices for their 
medication. In a separate bill Congress fixes doctor reimbursement so 
that a 21 percent rate reduction is avoided and doctors become more 
willing to take senior Medicare patients again.
  Private employer-based health insurance would still constitute 60 
percent of the way Americans get their health care. This bill provides 
a public option with negotiated rates and without tax-payer subsidies 
that will drive down costs without creating an uneven playing-field 
with private insurance companies.
  H.R. 3962 does better by small businesses too. Small businesses with 
payrolls below $500,000 are excluded from having to provide health care 
or pay penalties. The old bill set that limit at $250,000. And only 
individuals earning over $500,000 and families over $1 million would be 
subject to the surcharge for incomes over those amounts.
  Oregon does particularly well in the new bill. Not only are many of 
our pioneering health care delivery systems included in the bill with 
grants for expanding, but two studies create a Congress proof 
opportunity for the restructuring of Medicare reimbursement that will 
reward high-quality low-cost states like Oregon.
  Perhaps most significantly H.R. 3962 substantially reduces the cost 
of the initial reform bill. Almost $200 billion is trimmed from the 
costs, with more to come in negotiations with the Senate and President 
Obama. According to CBO, the bill reduces the deficit both in the 
short- and long-term. According to leading economists, the bill lowers 
premiums going forward compared to current law for all income groups, 
even those without subsidies.
  I believe we can do better! I have personal commitments from the 
President that more cost containment is necessary and will occur as we 
work with the Senate. The Senate subsidies are much more sustainable 
over the long-term and strike a better balance between making health 
care affordable and curbing the overutilization through meaningful cost 
sharing.
  I am excited about reforming our health care system to deliver better 
health outcomes and more affordable costs for families, businesses and 
our Nation.

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to cast one of the 
most important votes of my congressional career--a vote in support of 
H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act.
  We are on the threshold of history that has been a half-century in 
the making.
  The promise of America as a land of equality and opportunity that 
embraces and cares for all of its citizens is but an empty promise 
without the guarantee of healthcare and the freedom from financial 
devastation resulting from illness.
  For so many of us, this long battle has had a singular, courageous 
champion who has fought like a lion for the sick, the elderly, the left 
behind and the left out. Our great achievement today will also be our 
greatest memorial to our friend, mentor and inspiration, Senator Edward 
Kennedy.
  Like Senator Kennedy, many of us wondered--as the decades marched 
by--whether our efforts for comprehensive healthcare reform would ever 
be successful.
  His unwavering commitment to decent healthcare for all Americans has 
paved the way for the bill before us today. It is on the shoulders of 
this giant that we stand and I pledge my vote as a tribute to the late 
Senator.
  At the heart of this legislation is one simple, indisputable idea: 
Everyone deserves health insurance they can afford.
  Our system is broken. In a nation where health is a daily value and 
where health care is the finest in the world, I hear daily from 
constituents who cannot afford to take care of themselves or their 
families, who are driven out of the system by skyrocketing premiums, 
who live under the threat of a shuttered business or a bankrupted 
household, or who simply have to roll the dice and hope they will get 
better--or not too much worse.
  Perhaps most tragically, our current system turns its back on those 
most in need--those with a pre-existing condition. Health insurance is 
meaningless if it's only available to the healthy.
  H.R. 3926 will cover 96 percent of all Americans.
  It prohibits discrimination based on pre-existing conditions.
  It eliminates lifetime caps--immediately.
  It includes a non-profit public insurance option designed to increase 
competition and lower prices.
  It provides affordability credits to lower-income Americans to help 
them pay for coverage.
  It modernizes and strengthens Medicare, ensuring the program's 
continued solvency and eliminating the prescription ``donut-hole.''

[[Page E2763]]

  And, very importantly, it is budget neutral.
  When I return to my constituents in California, I'll be proud to tell 
them that with this bill: Employer-based health coverage will improve 
for 461,000 men, women and children who live in my District; 84,000 
households in my District will receive affordability credits to help 
them pay for coverage they otherwise couldn't afford; 9,500 of the 
seniors in my District will no longer fall victim to the prescription 
drug ``donut-hole''; 17,100 small businesses in my District will be 
able to obtain affordable healthcare coverage; and that 15,400 small 
businesses will qualify for tax credits that will help reduce their 
health insurance costs.
  I'm also proud that I joined with Senator Kennedy to author H.R. 
3962, to create an FDA pathway for the approval of biosimilar drugs.
  Biotechnology is a complex and emerging field that can harness the 
power to cure cancer, AIDS, and diabetes, and prevent the onset of 
deadly and debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's, heart disease, 
Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and arthritis.
  My amendment will save the government $6 billion over the next ten 
years while continuing to foster innovation and new advancements.
  After President Obama signs this bill, millions of Americans who 
today have no health insurance will have it. Patients who are now 
denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition will no longer be 
shut out of the system. Millions more seniors will be able to afford 
their medications, and the average American family will pay less for 
their health coverage.
  Most importantly, we will be keeping our promise to the American 
people that they will have affordable health insurance which they 
cannot lose or have taken away from them if they become ill.
  I look forward to passing this landmark piece of legislation and 
seeing it signed into law by the President.

                               speech of

                           HON. STEVE ISRAEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Affordable Health 
Care for America Act. I join the American Cancer Society, the American 
Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, Consumers Union, 
AARP, and many other organizations in the strong belief that this bill 
will bring financial relief to middle class families and businesses who 
have faced skyrocketing costs for health care.
  In the past months, I have listened carefully to the families and 
businesses I represent on Long Island. I held many public forums on 
health care; visited businesses facing double digit premium increases; 
met with physicians and toured hospitals; invited protesters into my 
office to hear their concerns; convened a tele-town hall that attracted 
5,000 senior citizens; hosted another tele-town hall meeting with 
nearly 11,000 people; organized a live town hall meeting at Suffolk 
Community College with 500 people; made hundreds of personal phone 
calls to constituents; and much more.
  People with strong opinions on opposite sides of this issue have 
insisted that I listen to them, believing that they represent a 
majority of our community. And at the end of the day, I believe 
strongly that we can no longer do business as usual. In the past 10 
years, Long Islanders have seen their health insurance premiums 
increase 80 percent. And if we do nothing, the average Long Islanders' 
health costs will increase $1,800 every year.
  Employer-sponsored health insurance premiums have increased 80 
percent in 10 years for Long Island businesses. As a result, more 
companies are forced to cut payroll, trim raises, or increase employee 
contributions. Some have told me if this continues, they will have to 
begin considering offering no health insurance.
  And almost every week, my office in Hauppauge receives complaints 
from neighbors who were denied insurance coverage due to preexisting 
conditions. They complain about ``sticker shock'' when they open their 
insurance company statement and learn that they'll have to pay for a 
greater share of services they assumed were covered.
  In a region with unacceptably high property taxes and energy costs, 
we simply cannot afford to allow health care to continue skyrocketing.
  The original bill did contain provisions that concerned me. As a 
result of my town meetings and other visits, I was able to help improve 
the bill.
  For example:
  Many Long Islanders complained that the original family income 
trigger for the surtax that will fund nearly half of this bill was too 
low. I successfully fought to raise the trigger to $1 million per 
family. As a result, no Long Island family with earnings less than $1 
million will see a surtax to pay for this bill.
  I worked to increase the trigger for small business health care from 
$250,000 to $500,000 in payroll.
  Many seniors in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans asked for 
faster relief from the so called ``donut hole.'' In 2010, they will 
receive an immediate $500 expanded benefit. That will assist 8,000 
seniors in our district alone.
  To lower drug costs, I fought to include a provision allowing the 
Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate volume discounts 
with big drug companies, just like the VA does.
  I sought to increase funding for the Family Caregiver Support program 
to help Americans who take care of their parents or grandparents.
  Some argued that insurance should be sold across State lines. This 
bill would allow companies to sell plans across State lines where 
States joined together to form interstate compacts to allow it.
  Before accessing the newly created Health Insurance Exchange, one's 
citizenship and immigration status will be verified by the Department 
of Homeland Security.
  Mr. Speaker, I have heard some insist that this bill represents a 
government takeover of health care. It is simply not true. All the bill 
does is give Long Islanders the choice to enter into a competitive 
Health Insurance Exchange to shop for a health insurance plan--just 
like every Member of Congress. There, private companies will compete 
for one's business. Among those private businesses will be a ``public 
option'' which must be self-sufficient and funded from premiums paid by 
its enrollees. That option will not need to worry about dividends or 
profits, CEO salaries or expensive marketing campaigns. It will compete 
against the private plans: just like public colleges compete against 
private colleges, just like ExpressMail competes against FedEx, just 
like Perrier competes against the Suffolk County Water Authority. I 
haven't heard anyone call the water they drink from their faucets 
``socialist water''. And I've not heard any reasonable person call 
Medicare socialized health care. The reason the public option is so 
vital is that its lower costs will incentivize insurance companies who 
have doubled their premiums to be more price sensitive in order to 
attract customers.
  Finally, Mr. Speaker, a special word for those who have demanded that 
I ``listen to them.'' We tend to see the world through our own eyes, 
leaving very little room for what may be outside our vision. People on 
polar opposites of this issue have understandably demanded that I 
``listen to them.'' Both claim to represent a majority of Long 
Islanders. I don't pay much attention to polls, Mr. Speaker, but a 
recent poll in Newsday indicated that 70 percent of Long Islanders 
support the public option. I will say that after that poll, some of the 
same people who demanded I listen to the majority told me the majority 
doesn't know what it's talking about so I should ignore it.
  I made a final judgment by listening carefully to everyone. I fought 
and delivered improvements in this bill. Is it perfect? No. Government 
can never be perfect, and I'll continue to demand that it be more 
competent. But this bill, for the first time, will give Americans more 
choice and control over a virtual health insurance monopoly and will 
finally end the days when someone who has faithfully paid their 
premiums from hearing that their diabetes, their cancer, their 
children's autism, are no longer covered.

                               speech of

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I and others have spoken at 
length on the ways that this bill will improve health care for all of 
our constituents. Another significant benefit of this legislation which 
has not received as much attention will be the creation of new high-
paying jobs in this country. Let me repeat that for some of my friends 
on the other side of the aisle, this bill will create high-paying, 
high-quality jobs in health care delivery, technology, and research in 
the United States.
  First, this bill will create enormous demand for health care workers, 
especially in the area of primary care. Insuring millions of Americans 
in this country who currently have no insurance will allow them to see 
primary care providers and receive the wellness and preventive care 
they have been denied for too long. This influx of new patients will 
need doctors, nurses and technicians for their care, while reducing 
overall health care costs because they will not need much more 
expensive hospitalizations. I support channeling resources that for too 
long have been used to treat people once they become sick into jobs and 
services that will prevent people from getting sick in the first place.
  Second, this bill will continue the efforts we began in the stimulus 
package to deploy new health information technologies that better 
manage both the quality of care patients receive and the cost at which 
they receive it. New health care exchanges and new demands on the 
health system to provide high-quality and cost-effective health care 
will create new opportunities and markets for our brightest minds in 
technology. They will be incentivized to create and develop products 
that will be a win/win for Americans: high-quality health care at an 
affordable price.
  Third, this bill will create high-quality research opportunities in 
this country. The Energy and Commerce Committee enacted a framework for 
allowing biosimilar competition in this country. This new class of 
medicines will help lower costs and bring competition to one area that 
is key to the future of our health care system. Biotechnology is on the 
cutting edge of efforts to reduce costly invasive procedures and allow 
our constituents to live healthier and more productive lives. The 
creation of this new class of medicines comes with requirements for new 
clinical research and testing, especially in the area of whether a new 
biosimilar can be interchangeable with an innovator's product. This 
research will create high-quality and high-paying jobs and it is 
imperative that we keep this research and these jobs in this country. 
We cannot allow these research opportunities to leave the United States 
and we must ensure that these new medicines are safe. I intend to work 
with the Secretary of HHS and the Commissioner of the FDA to ensure 
that the testing and research on these biosimilars occur in this 
country to make certain that it is done properly and safely and to 
benefit our economy.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill is an investment and an exciting opportunity 
to create the kind of jobs we so desperately need in this United States 
while at the same time improving the lives of all Americans. This bill 
will improve health care, create jobs, and grow our economy.

                               speech of

                            HON. JARED POLIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I would like to express my strong 
opposition to the Stupak/Pitts Amendment, which unfortunately passed 
the House by a vote of 240-194. This amendment places a woman's right 
to choose at risk, for it would place new obstacles in the way of women 
seeking reproductive health care services. The Stupak Amendment goes 
further than existing laws. This amendment dictates which medical 
procedures are offered in the private market.
  Health care reform is supposed to increase coverage. This amendment 
singles out women and reduces their coverage. Women's access to 
comprehensive reproductive health services is not just about equality 
between men and women but also equality along economic lines. This 
amendment sets up a system where only wealthier women could afford a 
safe abortion. It would prohibit low-income women who receive 
affordability tax credits from purchasing a private insurance plan that 
covers abortion, despite the fact that over 80 percent of health 
insurance plans currently cover abortion. In other words, a woman who 
happens to be low-income will be denied the right to purchase a health 
care plan with abortion coverage simply because she qualifies for 
affordability tax credits. This is discriminatory, plain and simple.
  Besides purchasing insurance in the exchange, the primary alternative 
for low-income individuals is the public option. Not only does this 
amendment prohibit access to abortion coverage if a low-income woman 
receives affordability tax credits in the exchange, but this amendment 
also prohibits the public option from providing abortion care, despite 
the fact that it would be funded through private premium dollars.
  Under the Stupak Amendment, low-income women who either receive 
affordability tax credits or purchase insurance through the public 
option have to purchase a separate, single-service ``abortion rider'' 
policy. Not only does this idea discriminate against low-income women 
but it makes no sense either. Women who end up in the tough position of 
having to seek an abortion never planned on being in that situation. 
The vast majority of women will not choose to purchase an ``abortion 
rider'' policy because they do not plan on ever having an abortion, and 
when the day arises when they may need abortion coverage, unfortunately 
it will not be there for them.
  The women of America should have access to their fundamental right to 
choose, regardless of their income level. I urge my colleagues to join 
me today in defense of that fundamental right.

                               speech of

                           HON. ANNA G. ESHOO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to oppose the 
amendment offered by my colleague, Representative Bart Stupak. I know 
that he is following his own conscience, but I want to preserve the 
right of women nationwide to follow their conscience as well. I support 
a woman's right to be either for or against abortion. The decision is a 
private one and it is a matter of faith as well as a matter of 
conscience, and it is supported by our Constitution.
  This amendment is not about federal funding for abortion . . . the 
current version of the bill and federal law, the Hyde Amendment, 
already prohibit spending tax dollars to finance abortions. This 
amendment goes beyond that language. It prohibits private health 
insurance plans that receive even one dollar of federal funding to 
offer abortion services to any of their customers. This eliminates 
coverage for an important health service that millions of women 
currently have. This amendment leaves women even worse off than they 
are now. I cannot support such all-encompassing language.
  There is a certain irony here that demonstrates how prejudiced this 
amendment is toward women. Insurance plans would allow a man to obtain 
Viagra and cause an unwanted pregnancy, but it penalizes women for 
becoming pregnant.
  Insurance is intended to cover the unexpected. Yet, this amendment 
would deny women the right to purchase their own coverage as part of a 
regular insurance plan. It will heap an ugly punishment upon those who 
often times can least afford it, and it will push women into the past 
of back-alley butchers.
  Today women are entitled under the law to a safe abortion. It is 
estimated that in California before the Roe v. Wade decision, about 
100,000 illegal abortions were performed each year. Abortion was the 
most common single cause of maternal deaths in California prior to 
1973. We should not turn back the clock. As we work to provide 
universal health for all our citizens, women should be protected. This 
amendment does nothing to advance this and I ask my colleagues to 
defeat it.

                               speech of

                           HON. AARON SCHOCK

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, this past Monday night I decided I could 
better serve the citizens of the 18th district of Illinois by hosting a 
town hall meeting to listen to their thoughts and concerns with the 
Speaker's health care proposal, rather than rush back to Washington to 
vote on a resolution honoring man's best friend.
  As I participated in a town hall in Washington, Illinois with more 
than 1,000 people in attendance, I heard a reoccurring theme of 
concern, outrage, disbelief, frustration and fear for what Speaker 
Pelosi's health care proposal could mean.
  The final question of the night came from a young man named Joshua. 
In a room surrounded by those three or four times his age, young Joshua 
had the courage to ask me the difficult question if I supported what 
President Obama wants to do with Healthcare.
  I told Joshua that I've spent my first 9 months in office trying to 
figure out exactly what the President was actually trying to do with 
health care. It is this precise confusion of goals, conflicting 
messages and lack of communication from the Majority which has all 
Americans still trying to figure out exactly what the President and the 
Speaker are trying to do.
  Unfortunately, we've finally learned what they want to do. Tonight, 
under the cover of darkness, the majority finally passed a health care 
plan that will raise taxes, raise health care costs, add to our 
national debt, and hurt America's seniors, families and small 
businesses. Over half those covered in the bill are done so by 
expanding entitlements instead of helping them afford insurance. This 
only exacerbates insurance premiums for ordinary Americans and 
dramatically increases our nation's debt.
  The bill tonight was about expanding the size of government and 
leading us down the road to a no-choice government-run healthcare 
system. Instead of working across party lines to pass bipartisan 
reform, Speaker Pelosi has decided to let the votes against this 
massive entitlement expansion be the only true thing bipartisan about 
it.

                          HON. EARL BLUMENAUER

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Saturday, November 7, 2009

  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, passage of the Affordable Health Care 
for America Act marks the most important single step in 100 years in 
addressing the health care needs of American families. For the first 
time, the U.S. government has dealt comprehensively with the entire 
health care system.
  Tonight I voted for every Oregonian who has faced bankruptcy when 
they've lost their care or has been denied coverage because of a pre-
existing condition. Tonight, I voted to protect every Oregonian who has 
health insurance but sees their costs rising every year.

[[Page E2757]]

  I'm pleased we were successful in the incorporation of major reforms, 
improving care for all Americans while strengthening the position of 
Oregon medical care providers.
  This critical milestone, while historic, signals more hard work ahead 
to get the bill to the President's desk. I will work to strengthen the 
reforms while fighting to lower costs to make health care more 
affordable for families and the federal treasury.
  We must then be prepared to keep working to implement this sweeping 
change. But tonight we should all pause to celebrate this moment in 
history.

       (b) Administration.--The Secretary may carry out this 
     section directly or, pursuant to agreements, grants, or 
     contracts with States, through State high-risk pool programs 
     provided that the requirements of this section are met. ``For 
     a State without a high-risk pool program, the Secretary may 
     work with the State to coordinate with other forms of

     partnerships.''.

     during the 6-month period ending on the date the individual

       (2) who is the spouse or dependent of an individual who is 
     described in paragraph (1);
       (3) who has not had health insurance coverage or coverage 
     under an employment-based health plan for at least the 6-

     this section; ``or.''
       (4) who on or after October 29, 2009, had employment-based

     such coverage (for any coverage period beginning on or after 
     such date) exceeds such excessive percentage as the Secretary 
     shall specify.
     For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), a person who is in a 
     waiting period as defined in section 2701(b)(4) of the Public 
     Health Service Act shall not be considered to be eligible for 
     coverage under an employment-based health plan.
       (d) Medically Eligible Requirements.--For purposes of 
     subsection (c)(1)(B)(ii), an individual described in this 
     subsection is an individual--
       (1) who, during the 6-month period ending on the date the 
     individual applies for high-risk pool coverage under this 
     section applied for individual health insurance coverage 
     and--
       (A) was denied such coverage because of a preexisting 
     condition or health status; or
       (B) was offered such coverage--
       (i) under terms that limit the coverage for such a 
     preexisting condition; or
       (ii) at a premium rate that is above the premium rate for 
     high risk pool coverage under this section; or
       (2) who has an eligible medical condition as defined by the 
     Secretary.
     In making a determination under paragraph (1) of whether an 
     individual was offered individual coverage at a premium rate 
     above the premium rate for high risk pool coverage, the 
     Secretary shall make adjustments to offset differences in 
     premium rating that are attributable solely to differences in

     individual shall--
       (1) submit to the Secretary an application for 
     participation in the program, at such time, in such manner, 
     and containing such information as the Secretary shall 
     require;

     discontinuance.
       (f) Protection Against Dumping Risks by Insurers.--
       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish criteria for 
     determining whether health insurance issuers and employment-
     based health plans have discouraged an individual from 
     remaining enrolled in prior coverage based on that 
     individual's health status.
       (2) Sanctions.--An issuer or employment-based health plan 
     shall be responsible for reimbursing the program for the 
     medical expenses incurred by the program for an individual 
     who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, the 
     Secretary finds was encouraged by the issuer to disenroll 
     from health benefits coverage prior to enrolling in the 
     program. The criteria shall include at least the following 
     circumstances:
       (A) In the case of prior coverage obtained through an 
     employer, the provision by the employer, group health plan, 
     or the issuer of money or other financial consideration for 
     disenrolling from the coverage.
       (B) In the case of prior coverage obtained directly from an 
     issuer or under an employment-based health plan--

[[Page H12627]]

       (i) the provision by the issuer or plan of money or other 
     financial consideration for disenrolling from the coverage; 
     or
       (ii) in the case of an individual whose premium for the 
     prior coverage exceeded the premium required by the program 
     (adjusted based on the age factors applied to the prior 
     coverage)--

       (I) the prior coverage is a policy that is no longer being 
     actively marketed (as defined by the Secretary) by the 
     issuer; or
       (II) the prior coverage is a policy for which duration of 
     coverage form issue or health status are factors that can be 
     considered in determining premiums at renewal.

       (3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
     construed as constituting exclusive remedies for violations 
     of criteria established under paragraph (1) or as preventing 
     States from applying or enforcing such paragraph or other 
     provisions under.."

                 AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I am compelled to address this body 
tonight after having listened to my colleagues over the last few days 
fabricate falsely about the Affordable Health Care for America Act.
  Every 12 minutes, an American dies in the greatest country on Earth 
simply because he cannot afford to live. Americans lie right now, as I 
speak, in their homes while in pain, suffering because they cannot 
afford the care that would bring them relief.
  I meet people in my district who choose between medication and food, 
parents who go without medical treatment to pay for heat and clothing 
for their children, and family members who believe with all their 
hearts that loved ones have died because they lacked adequate health 
care.
  Like the misrepresentations about this bill, these injustices must 
stop. The time to act is now. In the words of President Obama, we must 
have the urgency of now.
  H.R. 3962 helps uninsured Americans immediately. It immediately 
creates an insurance program with financial assistance for those who 
are uninsured or for those who have been denied policies because of 
preexisting conditions. It also allows those who are unemployed to keep 
their COBRA coverage until the exchange is operational.
  Health insurance reform will mean greater stability and lower costs 
for all Americans. That means affordability for the middle class, 
security for our seniors, and responsibility to our children. It also 
will mean coverage for 96 percent of Americans. According to the CBO, 
the bill reduces the deficit by $30 billion over the first 10 years.
  In their speeches, Republicans have described this bill as the 
Speaker's bill. They call it the ``Pelosi bill.'' This bill does not 
belong to the Speaker, although she has done a phenomenal job in 
helping us to craft it.
  This bill belongs to the hardworking Americans who have insurance but 
who want a more transparent and stable health care marketplace that 
focuses on quality, affordable choices for all Americans, and that 
keeps insurers honest.
  It belongs to 47 million Americans who are suffering and who have no 
help on the horizon.
  This bill belongs to the seniors living in rural areas all over our 
country who will receive better Medicare coverage because of this bill.
  It belongs to the children throughout our Nation who are so poor that 
their parents cannot even afford checkups. These are the children whose 
lives will be crippled by diabetes simply because doctors have not 
diagnosed them as being at risk.
  Our children are our living messages we send to a future we will 
never see. The question is: What type of message are we sending? They 
will suffer simply because they do not know how to reverse the symptoms 
leading them down a troubled road.
  This bill belongs to 44,000 Americans who die every year because they 
lack insurance. They have been guaranteed life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness by founding documents to which my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle constantly refer. Americans are denied 
those things by the thousands. They cannot afford care and so they die.
  That's right, Madam Speaker. For every page that Republicans have 
printed out and have used as props, for every page, 22 Americans will 
die this year because they cannot pay for the care that will save their 
lives.
  It is telling that, using valuable tax dollars, they printed those 
pages to make copies of a bill that is available, searchable, and 
downloadable online. It is a perfect metaphor for the millions of 
dollars this bill will save Americans.
  Our health care system will save more than $150 billion every year, a 
call that President Obama made in the beginning of his campaign. The 
bill moves America to a health care system with an electronic 
recordkeeping system, cutting fraud, excessive administrative costs and 
medical mistakes.
  Republicans do not care about those savings or about that progress. 
Like the pages of the taxpayer-provided paper used here today on this 
floor, they are props--only interested in being weights to drag down, 
to slow down, and to eventually stop true health care reform.
  It pains me to say these words, but this is how I feel.

      HEALTH REFORM AND THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA ACT

  (Ms. BERKLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I can't stand here today and tell you that 
this legislation will solve every health care problem we face as a 
Nation, but I can tell you this. There's 460,000 Nevadans that have no 
health insurance at all. In my district alone, this bill will provide 
coverage for 163,000 of my fellow Nevadans.
  It's not just the uninsured that will benefit. In Las Vegas, more 
than 200,000 households will receive credits to make insurance more 
affordable and over 16,000 small businesses will be provided with a tax 
credit to make it easier for them to provide coverage to their 
employees.
  The bill improves coverage for seniors by closing the doughnut hole, 
eliminating copays for preventive services, and extending the solvency 
of the Medicare program for another 5 years. It eliminates preexisting 
conditions as a reason to deny coverage. It lifts the lifetime limits. 
I have 10-year-old children who are juvenile diabetics in my office 
that have already exceeded their lifetime caps. This bill eliminates 
that.
  The current health care system is unsustainable.

        IN SUPPORT OF THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA ACT

  (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Affordable 
Health Care for America Act. This bill represents tireless negotiation, 
compromise, and input from Americans all across the country. We have 
been trying to reform our health care system since Harry Truman's 
Presidency, so this bill by no means represents brand new ideas; 
rather, it has been a work in progress for decades.
  Attempts to reform our health care system in the past have failed 
because of false claims that this is socialized medicine. And, of 
course, these are the same arguments that the bill's opponents are 
making today. But it won't work this time because the American people 
are tired of unaffordable premiums, of unfairly losing coverage, and 
the fine print that prevents them from getting the care they need. It 
gives the power back to the patient by creating a more transparent, 
more competitive health insurance market.
  In a country as wealthy as ours, no one should have to face losing 
their life or seriously compromising their health because they cannot 
access, cannot afford, or have been denied health care coverage.

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose Speaker Pelosi's 
government takeover of health care.
  This bill, which weighs in at nearly 2,000 pages and at more than 20 
pounds, will raise taxes on individuals and small businesses, cut 
health care for seniors, raise health care premiums, ration care, and 
give Federal bureaucrats more power over decisions that should be made 
by our constituents and by their doctors. The bill raises taxes by $730 
billion, and it costs nearly $1.3 trillion. We literally cannot afford 
this government takeover of health care. There is a better way.
  We should, instead, be lowering health care costs by enacting medical 
liability reform, strengthening association health plans, allowing the 
purchase of health insurance across State lines, and eliminating waste, 
fraud, and abuse in Federal health care programs.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose Speaker Pelosi's health 
care bill.

     AMERICA'S AFFORDABLE HEALTH CHOICES ACT ADDRESSES PRIMARY CARE

  (Ms. SCHWARTZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, finding a uniquely American solution to 
ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, meaningful health 
coverage must also ensure adequate access to health care providers and 
services.
  Primary care providers are on the front line of our health care 
system, treating acute and chronic problems and keeping costly 
conditions from worsening. Yet, despite this essential role, it is 
primary care where we face the most acute shortages.
  Since 1998, the percentage of residents choosing primary care has 
dropped from 50 percent to 20 percent. By 2025, America will have a 
shortage of 46,000 primary care providers.
  I am very proud that the provisions in the health care reform 
legislation that is moving through Congress will address this impending 
crisis. It provides scholarships and loan repayments to primary care 
providers. It increases payments for primary care services. It 
eliminates copayments for Medicare beneficiaries who seek preventative 
care, and it creates incentives for doctors and nurses to coordinate 
care for patients with multiple chronic conditions.
  These are significant reforms that will improve access to primary 
care, that will improve health outcomes, and that will improve health 
care costs. We should support better health care for Americans by 
supporting health care reform.

          INTRODUCING THE CHILD HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. RON PAUL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, March 12, 2009

  Mr. PAUL. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to help working Americans 
provide for their children's health care needs by introducing the Child 
Health Care Affordability Act. The Child Health Care Affordability Act 
provides parents with a tax credit of up to $500 for health care 
expenses of dependent children. Parents caring for a child with a 
disability, terminal disease, cancer, or any other health condition 
requiring specialized care would receive a tax credit of up to $3,000 
to help cover their child's health care expenses.
  The tax credit would be available to all citizens, regardless of 
whether or not they itemize their deductions. The credit applies 
against both income and payroll tax liability. The tax credits provided 
in this bill will be especially helpful to those Americans whose 
employers cannot afford to provide health insurance for their 
employees. These workers must struggle to meet the medical bills of 
themselves and their families. This burden is especially heavy on 
parents whose children have a medical condition, such as cancer or a 
physical disability, that requires long-term or specialized health 
care.
  As an OB-GYN who has had the privilege of delivering more than four 
thousand babies, I know how important it is that parents have the 
resources to provide adequate health care for their children. The 
inability of many working Americans to provide health care for their 
children is rooted in one of the great inequities of the tax code--
Congress's failure to allow individuals the same ability to deduct 
health care costs that it grants to businesses. As a direct result of 
Congress's refusal to provide individuals with health care related tax 
credits, parents whose employers do not provide health insurance have 
to struggle to provide health care for their children. Many of these 
parents work in low-income jobs; oftentimes, their only recourse for 
health care is the local emergency room.
  Sometimes parents are forced to delay seeking care for their children 
until minor health concerns that could have been easily treated become 
serious problems requiring expensive treatment. If these parents had 
access to the type of tax credits provided in the Child Health Care 
Affordability Act, they would be better able to provide care for their 
children, and our nation's already overcrowded emergency rooms would be 
relieved of the burden of having to provide routine care for people who 
otherwise cannot afford it.
  According to research on the effects of this bill done by my staff 
and legislative counsel, the benefit of these tax credits would begin 
to be felt by joint filers with incomes slightly above $18,000 dollars 
per year, or single income filers with incomes slightly above $15,000 
dollars per year. Clearly, this bill will be of the most benefit to 
low-income Americans balancing the demands of taxation with the needs 
of their children.
  Under the Child Health Care Affordability Act, a struggling single 
mother with an asthmatic child would at last be able to provide for her 
child's needs, while a working-class family will not have to worry 
about how they will pay the bills if one of their children requires 
lengthy hospitalization or some other form of specialized care.
  Madam Speaker, this Congress has a moral responsibility to provide 
tax relief so that low-income parents struggling to care for a sick 
child can better meet their child's medical expenses. Some may say that 
we cannot enact the Child Health Care Affordability Act because it 
would cause the government to lose revenue. But, who is more deserving 
of this money, Congress or the working parents of a sick child?
  The Child Health Care Affordability Act takes a major step toward 
helping working Americans meet their health care needs by providing 
them with generous health care related tax cuts and tax credits. I urge 
my colleagues to support the pro-family, pro-health care tax cuts 
contained in the Child Health Care Affordability Act.

                EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE AND HEALTH ACT

  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1814) to amend section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 to provide an additional religious exemption from the individual 
health coverage mandate.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 1814

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Equitable Access to Care and 
     Health Act'' or the ``EACH Act''.

     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION TO HEALTH COVERAGE 
                   MANDATE.

       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 5000A(d) of the 
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end 
     the following new subparagraph:
       ``(C) Additional religious exemption.--
       ``(i) In general.--Such term shall not include an 
     individual for any month during a taxable year if such 
     individual files a sworn statement, as part of the return of 
     tax for the taxable year, that the individual was not covered 
     under minimum essential coverage at any time during such 
     taxable year and that the individual's sincerely held 
     religious beliefs would cause the individual to object to 
     medical health care that would be covered under such 
     coverage.
       ``(ii) Nullified if receipt of medical health care during 
     taxable year.--Clause (i) shall not apply to an individual 
     for any month during a taxable year if the individual 
     received medical health care during the taxable year.
       ``(iii) Medical health care defined.--For purposes of this 
     subparagraph, the term `medical health care' means voluntary 
     health treatment by or supervised by a medical doctor that 
     would be covered under minimum essential coverage and--

       ``(I) includes voluntary acute care treatment at hospital 
     emergency rooms, walk-in clinics, or similar facilities, and
       ``(II) excludes--

       ``(aa) treatment not administered or supervised by a 
     medical doctor, such as chiropractic treatment, dental care, 
     midwifery, personal care assistance, or optometry,
       ``(bb) physical examinations or treatment where required by 
     law or third parties, such as a prospective employer, and
       ``(cc) vaccinations.''.
       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) 
     shall take effect as if included in the amendments made by 
     section 1501 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
     Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Schock) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.


                             General Leave

  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
to include extraneous material on the subject of the bill under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Illinois?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Just yesterday, a Washington newspaper headline read: ``Worst 
Congress Ever.''
  The thrust of the article was an indictment against Washington 
partisanship for its failure to move significant legislation on behalf 
of the American people. Now, to some degree, I suppose we have all felt 
at times that Congress just isn't making any laws. Of course, there are 
times, however, when Congress must make no law if we are to honor the 
oath we have sworn, which is to support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States. Indeed, ``Congress shall make no law respecting the 
establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
  Today, we have the opportunity to work together, across the aisle, to 
reaffirm this founding principle of our democracy. Together, we will 
reinforce the constitutional protection for sincere believers of all 
faiths against the unnecessary entanglement of government with their 
private religious expression. H.R. 1814 slightly expands the religious 
conscience exemption of the Affordable Care Act to include individuals 
with ``sincerely held religious beliefs'' among those eligible for an 
exemption from the individual mandate penalty.
  In order to qualify for the exemption under the EACH Act, an 
individual must affirm on an annual tax return that he or she cannot 
purchase coverage due to a sincerely held religious belief. This term, 
as defined by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as 
widely recognized by

[[Page H2274]]

the courts, is designed to protect various types of religious 
believers, not just those who belong to a traditional, organized 
religion.
  Today's bill must become law. Among the many problems with the 
Affordable Care Act, the current conscience exemption only protects the 
religious exemptions of a few select faiths. Now, I am fully aware that 
not every organization purporting to defend religious liberty is in 
favor of today's measure. I am, nevertheless, thankful that my good 
friend from the other side of the aisle, Mr. Keating, joined me in this 
effort. His home State of Massachusetts incorporated a similar 
religious liberty exemption in their State law, and it seems to be 
working out just fine. Since the law passed, only 6,500 Bay Staters 
have claimed the conscience exemption.
  This fact serves to reinforce the very principle of religious liberty 
we affirm today. The Constitution does not only protect the religious 
practices and beliefs of majority faith traditions, but, rather, the 
First Amendment protects even the smallest faith group and even the 
single individual against laws that infringe upon their sincerely held 
religious beliefs.
  Yet H.R. 1814 isn't only about constitutional jurisprudence and 
legislative correctness. It is about real people in my district and in 
yours who feel that their free exercise of religion is encumbered under 
the current law. One of them is a constituent of mine named Andrew, who 
lives in Chillicothe, Illinois. Andrew is a sincere believer whose 
religious commitment leads him to pursue only nonmedical health care 
options. According to Andrew, under the current law, he will be 
required to pay a fine once the individual mandate penalty kicks in. 
Regrettably, Andrew's religious beliefs were not considered when the 
present conscience exemption was enacted.
  Today, the EACH Act gives individuals like Andrew the ability to 
practice his religious beliefs without coercive government fining him 
for coverage he does not intend to use nor can he use and remain true 
to his most sincere religious beliefs. We recognize, however, that the 
immense unpopularity of ObamaCare among many Americans might entice 
otherwise law-abiding citizens to claim an exemption under the EACH Act 
in order to escape the law's penalty. In order to ensure that 
individuals do not game the system, this bill includes a strong 
provision that revokes the exemption and requires the individual to pay 
a stiff penalty if he or she seeks medical treatment at any point 
during that year.
  H.R. 1814 walks that fine line between protecting the First Amendment 
for every American and safeguarding taxpayers against potential fraud. 
Congress has long sought to uphold both of these commitments, and, 
today, this bill affords us a bipartisan opportunity to do it once 
again. I urge my colleagues to support this important fix to the 
Affordable Care Act and to pass H.R. 1814.
  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), the 
ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Mr. WAXMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
  Mr. Speaker, I know that this legislation carries important personal 
significance for some of our colleagues, and I respect that, but I want 
to express some real concerns about the bill because I feel it is 
overly broad. It could seriously undermine the Affordable Care Act and 
would establish a bad precedent for our tax laws.
  The bill states that individuals would not be required to obtain 
health insurance coverage if their ``sincerely held religious beliefs'' 
cause them to object to treatments that would be covered. The bill does 
not narrowly define ``sincerely held religious beliefs'' as those of 
Christian Scientists or other groups who rely on a religious method of 
healing. As a result, the bill would force the IRS to either accept 
virtually all attestations of exemption or to determine which 
Americans' religious beliefs meet that standard. This is impossibly 
difficult to enforce, and, frankly, it is not a role we want the IRS to 
take on.

  If the IRS chose to define ``sincerely held religious beliefs'' 
broadly, H.R. 1814 could allow, essentially, anyone opposed to the 
Affordable Care Act to opt out of coverage. That would lead to an 
increase in the number of uninsured Americans, and it would shift costs 
on to other taxpayers. Even if we assume the IRS could set a standard, 
there are significant problems with the legislation.
  The bill claims that individuals receiving ``voluntary'' medical care 
would lose their exemptions, but the IRS has no way to monitor 
individuals' use of voluntary medical care, making this totally 
unenforceable. Furthermore, individuals receiving ``involuntary'' care, 
such as expensive emergency care, would be allowed to remain exempt 
from the coverage requirement, passing the costs of their care on to 
hospitals and other taxpayers.
  I understand this is a sensitive issue. If religious groups that 
receive Medicare and Social Security benefits do not want to obtain 
health insurance, we need to examine that issue carefully. This bill 
should have been the subject of hearings. It should have been marked up 
in committee. Unfortunately, it was not.
  The Affordable Care Act is about moving our Nation towards universal 
health insurance coverage. That is the right thing for the health of 
our Nation. So I believe we need to tread very carefully when opening 
up new loopholes or exemptions, and we must be very cautious before 
assigning such sensitive duties to the IRS.
  Because of these concerns, I cannot support this legislation at the 
present time and in its present form. I hope our colleagues in the 
Senate will take a careful look at it and make substantial changes 
before considering it further.
  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's comments from 
California. I would just remind the gentleman that this is a near 
carbon copy of language that was implemented in the State of 
Massachusetts. It has had a very minimal effect, and it has impacted 
and has helped a very small number of people. It is why this bill has 
received such bipartisan support and is on the suspension calendar here 
tonight.
  With that, I yield 1 minute to the gentlelady from Tennessee (Mrs. 
Black), my good friend.
  Mrs. BLACK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my strongest support to my friend 
Mr. Schock's legislation, the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act.
  Even some of the President's most ardent supporters now recognize 
that ObamaCare is a fundamentally unfair law, and I am happy to see 
that so many Democrats join us in support of this important bill.
  Instead of having Federal bureaucrats decide who and what groups 
should be allowed religious conscience exemptions from this law's tax 
penalty, individuals, themselves, should be empowered to affirm their 
objections to this law's onerous and controversial mandates. That is 
what this commonsense bill would do, and I urge its swift passage to 
help protect Americans from the Obama administration's war on religious 
liberties.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Brady), the distinguished gentleman from the Ways and Means 
Committee.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
1814, the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act.
  One of our inalienable rights as American citizens is that we have 
the right to proscribe in whatever faith we so choose. With this right 
comes also the freedom from persecution and different treatment under 
the law. This body has long recognized the freedom of religion and has 
worked to ensure individuals of all faiths are treated fairly under the 
law. Even the Affordable Care Act, which imposes the burden of 
mandating the purchase of insurance, includes a religious conscience 
exemption from that individual mandate. However, this exemption is not 
fairly distributed to all Americans.

                              {time}  1645

  While covering many faiths, it doesn't cover all who seek protection. 
What the EACH Act does is to ensure that this exemption equally applies 
to

[[Page H2275]]

every American who wants it. It also protects individuals' First 
Amendment rights from being placed in jeopardy because of a requirement 
to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty.
  This is commonsense fairness legislation that extends a fundamental 
right to all Americans that have religious objections to standard 
medical care. This is a chance for us to right a wrong that I believe 
was just a drafting oversight.
  Of course, we ensure that the government doesn't impose a $1.5 
billion tax on Americans simply because of their religious beliefs.
  I thank my good friend and colleague from Illinois on the Committee 
on Ways and Means (Mr. Schock) for his leadership, as well as the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) for introducing this 
bipartisan legislation.
  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and vote ``yes'' for 
religious freedom.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to my good friend and 
neighbor from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Thank you to the gentleman and my 
colleague from the great State of Illinois for introducing this 
important bill.
  As somebody who has the only Christian Science college in the Nation 
in his district, this is a very important issue for religious freedom 
and religious rights.
  Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, has 550 students. They sent me 
this card. They have much more artistic talent than I do. It says:

       Thank you. We are so grateful for your defense of religious 
     freedom and hope that you will continue to advocate for this 
     bill until it passes.

  This is the voice of those who need this exemption. This is the voice 
of those who need their religious rights protected. This is why I am 
standing here today with my colleague from Illinois to talk about this 
bill and making sure that it passes.
  I would urge all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to 
respect the students and the faculty that work and attend this college 
in my district. I would hope that they would support this bill with us.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  I respect very much the specific impetus for this bill. 
Unfortunately, though, there have been no hearings on this legislation, 
and it was not marked up in committee.
  I would like to provide information on current law, on the scope of 
this legislation, and its potential consequences on our health care 
system.
  This is why I do not support this bill in its present form.
  First, it is important to note that the Affordable Care Act contains 
a religious exemption incorporating one that has been in the Internal 
Revenue code since 1965. This provision permits an exemption to members 
of religion that join together to provide mutual aid as a community--
for example, the Amish and Mennonite faiths--or participate in a health 
care sharing ministry, which is akin to insurance. These groups do not 
participate in government-funded social services, including Medicare or 
Social Security. This is a longstanding, well-defined, easy to 
implement exemption, and it was carried over to the ACA.
  The ACA's minimum essential coverage requirement was challenged in 
Federal court under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The court 
rejected the challenge, concluding that ACA did not impose a 
substantial burden on plaintiffs' religious exercise, despite claims 
that the plaintiffs ``believe in trusting in God to protect them from 
illness or injury'' and did not ``want to be forced to buy health 
insurance coverage.''
  Second, a requirement to purchase minimum health insurance is not a 
burden on one's exercise of their religious beliefs in the medical 
treatment they seek. The ACA does not preclude coverage for spiritual 
healing or prayer treatments. Indeed, the Church of Christ, Scientist 
explains on their Web site that under current law:

       Various U.S. Federal, State, and private health insurance 
     plans provide for the reimbursement of Christian Science 
     nursing care and practitioner treatment.

  Christian Scientists participate in Medicare, and Medicare covers 
some Christian Science services.
  It is the breadth of the language in the bill and the potential 
unintended consequences implementing it on a national basis that 
concerns me.
  The language provides an exemption if a person files a sworn 
statement to the IRS that their ``sincerely held religious beliefs'' 
would cause them to object to the ``medical health care'' that would be 
covered under ACA's minimum essential health care requirement.

  There is no indication as to how the IRS could implement this 
provision and, as a result, the exemption could essentially be 
available to anyone opposed to the ACA. While the bill states that 
individuals receiving ``voluntary'' medical care would lose their 
exemption, the IRS has no way to monitor individuals' use of voluntary 
medical care and to enforce this provision.
  Under the legislation, individuals receiving ``involuntary'' care--
such as emergency care--would be allowed to remain exempt from the 
coverage requirement, passing the cost of such care on to hospitals and 
other taxpayers.
  Because the bill does not define the ``sincerely held religious 
beliefs'' an individual would need to cite to avoid purchasing 
coverage, the IRS would be forced to determine which Americans' beliefs 
met the standard. Yet just 2 weeks ago, the House considered and passed 
H.R. 2531, the Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS Requests Act, 
that specifically prevented the IRS from asking taxpayers about their 
religious, political, or social beliefs.
  I regret that normal order has not been followed on H.R. 1814 so that 
these concerns could be surfaced and further information on the broad 
and problematic consequences of H.R. 1814 considered.
  For example, today, the American Academy of Pediatrics just expressed 
their concerns about the impact of H.R. 1814 on children. The American 
Civil Liberties Union also opposes the legislation, and the CBO just 
indicated today that the bill would increase the deficit by $1.5 
billion over 10 years and increase the uninsured by about 500,000 each 
year.
  Current religious exemptions in the Tax Code are circumscribed and 
well-defined. This bill would create a broad and difficult to determine 
exemption in the individual responsibility requirement and force the 
IRS to take on an inappropriate role. Congress should take a more 
careful approach to this issue.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  I would just remind my good friend from Michigan that had regular 
order been used when ObamaCare was passed, perhaps we would not be 
attempting to try and fix it now that it is law.
  The U.S. Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare in a 5-4 ruling 2 years ago 
this summer. The Justices did so by affirming that Congress, contrary 
to the repeated assurance by my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, had effectively created a tax that falls under the enumerated 
powers of article I of the Constitution, and, like a tax, compliance is 
mandatory, and enforcement is the job of the Internal Revenue Service.
  Since the summer of 2012, we have learned some things about the IRS 
that raise concerns about the agency's ability to do its job fairly. 
Likewise, we have watched the Obama administration usurp congressional 
authority and refuse to enforce the law that bears the President's 
name.
  Among the many ``executive fixes'' that seem to flow from the 
administration with increasing frequency, none have touched upon one of 
the most serious problems with ObamaCare, namely, current law will 
either force millions of Americans to violate their sincerely held 
religious beliefs or punish them for exercising those beliefs.
  We are not likely to agree today--or any day--on the underlying law. 
ObamaCare is as controversial now--and perhaps even more so--than when 
it was passed, but we can agree on this:

       Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of 
     religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

  Less than a mile from this Chamber, on the bank of the tidal basin, 
are inscribed in marble these words:

       Almighty God hath created the mind free. All attempts to 
     influence it by temporal

[[Page H2276]]

     punishments or burdens are a departure from the plan of the 
     Holy author of our religion. No man shall suffer on account 
     of his religious opinions or belief, but all men shall be 
     free to possess and maintain their opinions in matters of 
     religion.

  Those words, written by Thomas Jefferson, the first Democrat to be 
called ``Mr. President,'' capture the very essence of today's bill. It 
is our duty--even our oath that we take before God--to protect the 
religious freedoms of every American. ObamaCare does not do that. 
Today's bipartisan measure is a small but necessary step if Congress is 
to honor the great tradition of religious liberty enshrined in our 
founding documents and extended to succeeding generations of Americans 
by law.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1814, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the EACH Act on behalf 
of my constituents in Massachusetts that are seeking to continue to 
take advantage of the religious conscience exemption to the individual 
mandate that is currently provided to them under the 2006 Massachusetts 
health reform law.
   Since the individual mandate went into effect in Massachusetts, 
Donna Smiley, a Christian Scientist from Centerville, has taken 
advantage of the religious exemption provided in the law that prevents 
her from being penalized for her religious beliefs. Each year on her 
state tax return, the form has included a section for her to attest 
that because of her sincerely held religious beliefs she has chosen not 
to purchase medical health insurance.
   With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Donna would no longer 
be able to take advantage of the Massachusetts religious conscience 
exemption and would be penalized by the federal government for not 
having insurance. The EACH Act, modeled after the process that has been 
in place in Massachusetts for the past seven years, would ensure that a 
fair solution is reached so that Donna and other Americans are not 
penalized for their religious beliefs next year.
   The legislation would modestly expand the religious conscience 
exemption in the Affordable Care Act to certain individuals who have 
sincere religious beliefs against medical insurance and related medical 
care. As we saw in Massachusetts, which served as the model for the 
Affordable Care Act as well as the EACH Act, it is clear that a similar 
exemption in no way adversely affected the risk pool or generated a 
rise in abuse or fraud. According to the most recent report from 
Massachusetts' health insurance exchange, approximately 0.1% of the 
population or 6,500 residents apply annually for a religious exemption.
   Allowing for this narrow exemption to the Affordable Care Act is the 
fair and equitable path forward to ensure religious diversity.
   I believe there is a bipartisan coalition of support for this 
measure.
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support the Equitable Access to 
Care and Health (EACH) Act. This bill provides a modest expansion of 
the religious conscience exemption in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
  This bipartisan legislation has 218 cosponsors. The ACA currently 
provides for a religious conscience exemption; however, the exemption 
gives preference to only a few faiths. This exemption should be 
expanded to accommodate other religions whose ``sincerely-held 
religious beliefs'' would cause them not to purchase insurance.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this 
important piece of legislation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schock) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1814.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

         HEALTH EXCHANGE SECURITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2014

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                         HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 10, 2014

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3811. 
I feel strongly that the public and private sector should establish 
clear rules to protect Americans' personally identifiable information 
and an obligation to notify them promptly of any security or privacy 
breaches. The bill establishes a 48 hour notification requirement for 
any breaches of personally identifiable information from the Affordable 
Care Act Marketplaces. I would like to see an even shorter notice 
period, perhaps within 24 hours. However, whatever standard we use 
should apply to other government information systems. Moreover, we 
should take a comprehensive approach that also considers standards to 
protect consumers from involuntary disclosures of sensitive information 
from systems in the private sector. For example, private health 
insurance companies, which store large amounts personal health 
information, should also be subject to privacy and notification 
requirements. The recent incidents such as the massive data breaches at 
Target and Neiman Marcus illustrate the need for standards to be 
applied across the internet.
  This bill's failure to protect consumers from the wide array of 
potential security lapses reveals it for what it is--simply another 
politically motivated attack on the Affordable Care Act. The obvious 
goal is to scare people away from using the internet-based Marketplaces 
to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The truth is 
there have been no successful attacks on the site, it is continually 
being monitored, and stringent protocols exist should a breach occur. 
Moreover, because the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies 
from discriminating against individuals with pre-existing health 
conditions, the website does not collect or store detailed health 
personal health information. This hastily drafted legislation also 
contains other flaws. Specifically, it lacks important exceptions for 
law enforcement requirements, which could threaten ongoing 
investigations.
  Mr. Speaker, today's bill is not a policy solution; it's a scare 
tactic. There is no doubt that we must strengthen security features of 
all systems that contain American's personally identifiable 
information. I urge my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats on 
crafting serious, workable legislation to ensure the security of 
sensitive information on the internet.

        HEALTH CARE ACT ADVANCES EQUALITY, FREEDOM, AND FAIRNESS

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I pause today to think about history. I 
thought a lot about the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's 
assassination, and today is the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg 
Address. I thought I should bring some words to us from the Address. 
The world can never forget what the soldiers of Gettysburg did:

       It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to 
     the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far 
     so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated 
     to the great task remaining before us--that from these 
     honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for 
     which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we 
     here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in 
     vain--that this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
     freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, 
     for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.

  I am proud to serve in this House where John Kennedy served. I am 
proud to serve in this House where Abraham Lincoln served. It is my 
opinion that part of that work was providing equality, freedom, and 
fairness. I believe President Lincoln would support the Affordable Care 
Act and health care for all.

                           HEALTH CARE COSTS

  (Mr. FORTENBERRY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, many Americans are bewildered as to 
what is happening in Washington, and understandably so. But really the 
goal is pretty simple: we do need to keep this government running, 
while also protecting Americans from the harmful effects of the new 
health care law known as ObamaCare.
  Until now, the debate over health care has been largely in the 
abstract, but now many Americans are recognizing just how hurtful this 
is. Mr. Speaker, we need the right type of health care reform, but we 
don't need skyrocketing premiums or plans that erode health care 
liberties.
  Mr. Speaker, Yvonne just wrote to me from Nebraska. She said that, 
for her family of five, their monthly insurance premiums are going to 
nearly double. She asked: ``How can we call this the Affordable Care 
Act?''
  Rodney just wrote to me. He's a self-employed truck driver. He told 
me he may have to sell his truck just to afford the insurance.
  Mr. Speaker, since parts of this law have already been delayed, isn't 
it only fair that we delay the entire implementation for at least a 
year, giving us time to create the right type of health care reform, 
one that reduces costs and improves health care outcomes while also 
protecting the vulnerable in our society? That's what Americans 
deserve.

                      OBAMACARE IS NOT ABOUT CARE

  (Mr. RADEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RADEL. Certainty and stability are really all that our 
businessowners are asking for from us here in the government so that 
they can grow and create jobs. Instead, we handed them ObamaCare--a 
nightmare for people who own businesses or who are trying to start up 
their own businesses. Worse, it is a nightmare for you and your family. 
It's not fair for you, for your kids, for your grandkids. ObamaCare 
will and is cutting your wages, your hours--it may even cost you your 
job--and it is weakening our social safety net.
  In the big picture, ask yourself: When it comes to your health care, 
who knows how to care for you and your family most--you or some 
stranger here in Washington?
  ObamaCare is bad for business, putting 3 million American jobs in 
jeopardy--and that is not speculation, Secretary Sebelius. It's plain 
and simple. The Affordable Care Act is not affordable. It's not about 
your health; it's not about care--and it is not fair. It's not fair to 
our seniors, our kids, our grandkids, or to you.

                    RELIEF FROM THE HEALTH CARE LAW

  (Ms. JENKINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JENKINS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commend this Chamber for 
passing three pieces of legislation this week that will offer Americans 
relief from the President's health care law.
  These bills, which passed with bipartisan support, reaffirm America's 
commitment to the ideals of religious freedom, volunteerism, and 
military service. Unfortunately, the President's health care law has 
put all three of these in jeopardy.
  As written, the law would force Americans with a conscientious 
religious objection to buy health insurance and count volunteer 
firefighters, other emergency responders, Active military members, and 
our Nation's veterans toward the employer mandate tax thresholds.
  I am a proud cosponsor of three of these bills because they all will 
ensure the Affordable Care Act does not discriminate against Americans 
on the basis of religion or sacrifice.

                 PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE PLAN IS BROKEN

  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, the President's health care plan is broken. 
Let me read from some of the letters and communications my office is 
getting from around my district.

  Mike and Pat in Queen Anne's County write:

       Mr. Harris, my daughter's health care premium just rose 
     $648 a year thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Don't you or 
     other Republicans give up the fight.

  Cindy from Talbot County writes:

       I have just discovered that I can't keep the medical 
     insurance I have had for many years as it no longer exists 
     thanks to ObamaCare. Even though I am 58 years old, I must 
     pay for maternity benefits and pediatric dentistry when I 
     have no child under 19. I get an increased deductible and a 
     premium increase of $143 a month. What a mess that needs to 
     be fixed and in a hurry.

  Finally, Lorraine from Queen Anne's County writes that, in tears, she 
called our office. She was told by her insurer that her premium was 
just increased $256 a month. Her total payment that she and her husband 
now are going to pay is $956 a month, and her insurer told her that it 
went up because of ObamaCare.
  Mr. Speaker, the President's health care plan is broken.

                 HEALTH CARE PROMISES HAVE BEEN BROKEN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to relay disturbing, but 
not surprising, news about the President's health care law, news that 
is coming back from my district in Pennsylvania.
  Countless neighbors of mine employed by Sesame Place--which is a 
division of SeaWorld Entertainment--have been told that their hours 
will be cut back, presumably to comply with the crushing costs and 
regulations associated with the so-called Affordable Care Act. Adding 
insult to injury, they're being told that their health care is being 
terminated.
  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, President Obama made promises to the 
American people; and right now, those promises are not being kept. 
People were told that if they liked their plan that they could keep it. 
We were told that the health care law would not raise taxes, only to 
later see that 20 taxes are being used to fund this law.
  These promises have been broken, and my neighbors are seeing it. And 
they are seeing it up close, and they are seeing it personally. This 
law is hurting real people in my district and around the country. And 
it must be repealed, and it must be replaced.

                          ____________________

                              HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration last week announced 
that it would delay until 2015 the employer health mandate, a crucial 
provision of its signature health care law. This is of questionable 
legality.
  Days after that announced delay, the White House said that it would 
roll back requirements for new State online insurance marketplaces to 
verify the income and health coverage status of people who apply for 
subsidized coverage.
  And this week it was reported that the Obama administration has 
quietly notified insurers that a computer system glitch will limit 
penalties that the law says companies may charge smokers.
  These disclosures underscore the fact that ObamaCare is unaffordable, 
unworkable, and isn't what the American people were promised. It is 
time for President Obama to work with House Republicans to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act and replace it with effective, commonsense reforms 
that actually lower health care costs for working families and small 
businesses while protecting jobs and our economy.

     RESCUING AMERICANS FROM THE TRACKS OF HEALTH CARE DESTRUCTION

  (Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you why 
people would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It has become 
very, very clear that no matter how well-intentioned it may have been, 
it will not work. Time after time, we are finding that the things that 
they told us just aren't panning out to be true; and Senator Max 
Baucus, one of the law's main architects, recently described ObamaCare 
as a huge train wreck coming down.
  We have a chance to save Americans from being casualties of the train 
wreck. We can yank them off the tracks. Today, I voted to show that I 
am trying to do just that.
  I call on the United States Senate and the Senators to join us in 
rescuing the American people from the tracks of health care 
destruction.

                          HON. MAZIE K. HIRONO

                               of hawaii

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, March 21, 2012

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5) to 
     improve patient access to health care services and provide 
     improved medical care by reducing the excessive burden the 
     liability system places on the health care delivery system:

  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chair, this week we celebrate the 2nd anniversary of 
the Affordable Care Act.
  The Affordable Care Act is designed to fix so many of the things that 
ail our health care system and burden everyday families. The new law 
has already had a major impact on families in Hawaii.
  Senior citizens in Hawaii now have some relief from the high cost of 
prescription drugs. In 2010, over 24,000 people with Medicare in Hawaii 
received tax rebates to cover prescription drug costs.
  One senior from Waimea on Hawaii Island told me her $250 Medicare 
rebate check was ``a blessing'' in these tough economic times. She was 
able to use that money to pay for her other medical bills.
  In 2011, more than 21,000 people in Hawaii with Medicare saved close 
to $7 million on prescription drugs. The ``donut hole'' gap in coverage 
will be closed by 2020.
  A mother in Kailua told me that because of the Affordable Care Act, 
she could now add her 21 year-old son and 24 year-old daughter to her 
work-sponsored insurance plan.
  These are just two of the over 5,000 Hawaii young adults who can now 
stay on their parents' plan until age 26. This Kailua family is now 
using the thousands of dollars saved on health insurance each year for 
other household needs, including paying down past medical debt.
  The old saying is true, that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure.'' Preventive services like mammograms, colonoscopies, 
and wellness visits can detect problems early and prevent higher costs 
later.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, nearly all 210,000 Hawaii people 
with Medicare can now get preventive services without a co-pay or 
deductible. In addition, 240,000 people in Hawaii with private 
insurance are now eligible for preventive services--including women's 
health services such as domestic violence screenings and 
contraception--without a co-pay or deductible.
  The Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act already covers employees who work 
for more than 20 hours per week. As a result, a large percentage of our 
people can get the healthcare they need to stay healthy. We have a low 
rate of uninsured. And that saves all of us money.
  This is why I fought hard to preserve the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care 
Act in the House bill. I offered an amendment to preserve Hawaii's law 
and defended my amendment in committee, convincing my colleagues to 
support my amendment. Then, all of us in the delegation worked together 
to make sure the final Affordable Care Act law maintained Hawaii's law.
  Because of Hawaii's Prepaid Health Care Act, most employers in Hawaii 
already provide health coverage. The Affordable Care Act makes it 
easier for Hawaii small businesses by providing tax rebates to help pay 
for health care costs. Nearly 29,000 Hawaii businesses are eligible for 
tax credits under the law.
  Today I also met with leaders from eight of Hawaii's Community Health 
Centers. The Affordable Care Act helps fund these 73 health center 
sites that serve our highest-need rural and underserved communities, 
especially on the Neighbor Islands and rural Oahu. These health centers 
care for over 130,000 people and provide nearly 1,300 jobs throughout 
the state. The message these health leaders shared with me today is 
that the Affordable Care Act has made a positive difference in the 
lives of so many.
  Given how much the Affordable Care Act is already helping Hawaii, it 
is unfortunate that some in Congress want to repeal it. Because they 
can't repeal the law all at once, they have continued to try to de-fund 
the law or repeal one piece at a time.
  Today we're seeing another example of this, with H.R. 5. This bill 
would repeal the law's Independent Payment Advisory Board, also known 
as the IPAB.
  This board is a panel of experts that will make recommendations so 
taxpayers aren't paying for unnecessary Medicare procedures. This will 
save taxpayers billions of dollars, while protecting Medicare patients. 
The board would not be allowed to recommend any cuts to reimbursement 
rates that ration or harm patient care. Congress would vote on the 
board's recommendations, or come up with an alternative that reduces 
cost growth by more.
  In fact, because the Affordable Care Act has already reduced the 
growth in Medicare costs, the Board's recommendations wouldn't even be 
triggered until 2022 at the earliest.
  I have heard from some medical providers in Hawaii who are worried 
the IPAB will recommend cuts to their specialty. These providers say 
they might choose not to see Medicare patients. I can understand their 
concerns, but here's the thing: Medicare costs are going

[[Page E426]]

up partly because of expensive and sometimes unnecessary procedures. 
Most members of Congress aren't scientists or health care researchers, 
so a panel of experts would be better suited to use the best research 
to recommend reforms. I will vote against a bill to repeal IPAB that 
doesn't put a better system in its place.
  Unfortunately, this week the House Majority released a budget plan 
(the Ryan Budget) that would end the Medicare guarantee for our 
seniors. The Ryan Budget would again turn Medicare into a voucher 
system where seniors would have to purchase private plans. Private 
plans could deny and delay coverage, without Medicare's consumer 
protections our seniors get today. Last year's House budget tried this 
same plan, and the Congressional Budget Office said it would increase 
costs to people on Medicare by $6,000 per person starting in 2022.
  The bill we're voting on today, H.R. 5, also recycles an old 
misguided proposal for medical negligence reform. Someone who is harmed 
by misconduct by a health professional should not be barred from 
appropriate compensation for a permanent disability or loss of a loved 
one.
  The reality is that most medical providers are doing the right thing. 
A small percentage of doctors are responsible for over half the medical 
malpractice cases. We shouldn't be protecting this minority of 
providers over the rights of patients injured through these providers' 
negligence. Today's bill would deny justice to those who have been 
harmed by a small number of medical providers.
  Today's bill, H.R. 5, would also hurt states' rights by preempting 
state medical malpractice laws. A cap on damages for physical 
impairment, pain, suffering, and even death could not exceed $250,000, 
regardless of individual states' existing limits.
  Today's bill also extends far beyond medical malpractice. It would 
also apply to limit patients' rights in all ``health care lawsuits,'' 
which could include cases against pharmaceutical and medical device 
manufacturers, nursing homes, HMOs, insurance companies, and hospitals.
  While proponents of medical malpractice reform argue that frivolous 
lawsuits are driving up insurance premiums, the fact is, economic 
studies have shown that medical malpractice payouts are not the cause 
of higher premiums for consumers. Instead, premium increases are caused 
by other factors, such as too little competition in the private 
insurance market.
  I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 5.
  On the second anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, we should be 
fighting to make healthcare more accessible for our people, not less.
  Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much).

                         AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, having traveled home this 
weekend and listened to so many back in my district concerned about the 
lack of solutions and the lack of effort on behalf of the United States 
Congress to get things done, I told them to take heart, that sometimes 
these things are difficult. And I added:
  What if I tell you that we could deal with the rising cost of health 
care, we could bring down the national debt, and do it all by providing 
better quality, coordinated, and patient-centered care? That would be a 
good goal, they surmised.
  And what if I told you we could do this without raising taxes or 
cutting Medicare benefits? And what if I told you that all of this 
notion began from the seeds of an idea that was an outgrowth from the 
Heritage Foundation,

[[Page H4000]]

piloted by a Republican Governor in a Democratic State, and that served 
as the basis of the Affordable Health Care Act, which is the law of the 
land?
  The Affordable Health Care Act was not, in fact, what many Members on 
my side of the aisle support--a single-payer plan or a Medicare-for-all 
approach. But the law of the land is based on the Heritage Foundation 
idea and a Republican Governor from Massachusetts' formula for making 
sure that we could provide care to all of our citizens.
  Although the health care act has become politically driven and 
charged, what the American people want to see is a Congress that's 
serious about solutions, solutions that are workable on behalf of the 
American people.
  So let's start where we all agree. Paul Ryan has stated over again, 
very eloquently, that the rising cost of our debt and deficit is due to 
health care. I agree with him. When it comes to making sure that 
quality is improved for patients and care is coordinated more 
effectively, these are not Republican or Democratic ideas; these are 
American ideas, and why we need to move forward.
  We have no less than 10 separate studies--studies from the Institute 
of Medicine, Reuters, the Commonwealth Fund, among others, that show 
that there is between $750 billion to $800 billion in waste, fraud, 
abuse, and lack of coordination within our health care system. Why, 
then, would we consider, with that kind of waste, taking any money out 
of Medicare or taking any money away from the beneficiaries who use 
that to pay for their hospitals, their medical devices, their 
pharmacists, their doctors?
  What we need to do is face what the reality is. The reality is that 
the United States spends 18 percent of its gross domestic product on 
health care. We need to drive those costs down. By doing so, as 
businessmen will tell you, any model that is that inefficient, when the 
rest of the world is at 8 and 9 percent for health care and provides 
universal access to health care, and we're at 18 percent, with millions 
of our people still uninsured, if we drive that down and wring out all 
the inefficiencies, the waste in the system, then we can have health 
care for our constituents that's both coordinated and essential and 
drives down the national debt.
  All we have to do is recognize a simple fact. Take the very best of 
our public health system. Take the very best of science, technology and 
innovation. And then take the very best of our private sector and its 
entrepreneurs and have this body come together in a coordinated fashion 
to bring that about.
  It's happening without us. It's happening in the private sector, 
where leaders like Mark Bertolini from Aetna and others around this 
country are taking steps to drive down the cost of health care. They're 
doing it by coordinating care with the Mayo Clinic, with the Cleveland 
Clinic, with Sloan Kettering, with labs like Jackson Labs in my State. 
All of this is focused on making sure that we're going to have better 
outcomes for our people.
  We can do this together. Let's work toward solutions. This Congress 
is capable of doing it.

                              HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to declare that 
the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act affirms there's no 
going back to the health care of 2009 or even to the health care of 
1789. Improvements to health care are taking root right now in this 
country. That progress must continue. The Supreme Court decision today 
is a welcome victory for middle class families and bolsters the 
necessary changes taking place in health care today.
  Now we must keep Medicare sustainable and affordable by closing the 
prescription drug doughnut hole and cracking down on fraud. Now we must 
make sure middle class families have diverse options for high-quality, 
affordable health care. Now we must ensure that we meet the needs of 
northwest Washington State seniors, veterans, and families. Northwest 
Washington has already seen improvement. Seniors in the Second District 
who were in the doughnut hole have saved more than $800 on prescription 
medications so far this year. More than 173,000 people in northwest 
Washington State have health insurance that covers preventive care 
without copays or deductibles.
  It is time to move forward on health care. And today, America took a 
great step.

                          HEALTH CARE VICTORY

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)

[[Page H4164]]

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for the American 
people. The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act 
reaffirms our Nation's commitment to make sure that all Americans have 
access to quality, affordable health care and health insurance. For the 
millions of Americans who have gone without health insurance; the 
seniors who have struggled due to inadequate coverage; the women, 
children, and young adults that have been denied coverage for 
preexisting conditions, the Court's ruling is not only a victory but a 
validation that they deserve to have the most basic of human needs 
met--and that is access to health care.
  The ACA addressed so many gaps in the American health care system, 
from closing the Medicare part D doughnut hole to stopping the practice 
of denying those with preexisting conditions insurance coverage to 
claiming womanhood as a preexisting health condition to allowing young 
adults to stay on their parents' coverage.
  This law has changed the way our country manages and delivers all 
phases of our health care system, and I'm proud to have been part of 
its creation, and prouder still today to learn that the Court's 
decision was to uphold its constitutionality.

                       HEALTH CARE REFORM REPEAL

  (Mr. FINCHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. FINCHER. When the Congress passed the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act last year, it was promised that Americans would 
have better access, more affordable and higher quality care. Instead, 
ObamaCare created what we all despise and know won't work--more 
government bureaucracy at taxpayer expense: $500 billion in new taxes, 
$500 billion in Medicare cuts, more government bureaucracy, thousands 
of new IRS employees.
  What we need for the American people is transparency and 
accountability. Do I need to remind our colleagues that the approval 
rating of Congress is at an all-time low because we're not listening to 
the folks?
  We were sent here in November to do a job, and that's exactly what 
we're going to do. We're going to keep our promises we made to the 
American people, and we're going to hold true to that.
  So I stand in favor of repealing the health care bill. We have to 
create jobs and get our economy moving. If we allow this health care 
bill to stay in effect, that will not do.

            LET'S NOT RETURN TO A BROKEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

  (Mr. HEINRICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. Speaker, last year we took a desperately needed 
stand for America's families and small businesses over the insurance 
companies. We took a stand against insurance company abuses like 
discrimination against the sick, lifetime limits, the prescription drug 
doughnut hole, and a resulting $1 trillion increase to our deficit.
  We took a stand for hardworking Americans like Vicky Farrar, who 
moved to Albuquerque only to discover that to reenroll in a health 
insurance plan she would end up spending close to a third of her income 
because of her preexisting condition, high blood pressure. That kind of 
skyrocketing cost burden has stunted the dreams of American families 
and small businesses while lining the pockets of insurance company 
CEOs. But thanks to the American Affordable Care Act, Vicky and her 
doctor will be put back in charge of her health care and able to choose 
an affordable insurance policy.
  I urge my colleagues to vote against a return to the broken health 
care system that we spent decades trying to fix.

[Page H1546]
      TWO YEARS LATER, HEALTH CARE LAW'S BROKEN PROMISES CONTINUE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today the Supreme Court 
will begin hearing oral arguments on the constitutionality of the 
President's health care overhaul, the so-called Affordable Care Act of 
2010.
  While the Court is still months away from this decision, in many ways 
the verdict has already been cast by countless American families and 
small businesses negatively impacted by the law.
  In 2007, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested: ``We have to pass the 
bill so you can find out what's in it.''
  Two years since passage, American families have found out the hard 
way with increased taxes, looming regulations, and a slew of broken 
promises from fictitious cost controls to limitations on consumer 
choice.
  Most recently, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office served a 
devastating blow to President Obama's most frequently used tagline: 
``If you like your present coverage, you can keep it.''
  The CBO report suggested there will be a net loss of employer-based 
insurance coverage between 3 and 5 million people per year from 2019 to 
2022. This has the potential for 20 million Americans to lose their 
insurance coverage over just a 4-year span.
  On the first anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, I joined the 
U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee for a congressional field 
hearing in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in order to review the law's 
impact throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During the hearing, 
Pennsylvania's acting insurance commissioner, Michael Consedine, 
testified that new mandates on insurance coverage had resulted in 
premium increases of up to 9 percent.
  These figures mirror the national trend as outlined in a recent study 
by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Kaiser report shows that the 
average annual premium for family coverage through an employer reached 
$15,073 in 2011, an increase of 9 percent over the previous year. This 
is a far cry from Barack Obama's 2008 proposition that his law would 
cut family premiums by $2,500 before the conclusion of his first term 
in office.
  President Obama had also promised that he will not sign a health care 
plan that adds one dime toward deficits either now or in the future. 
However, an honest accounting of the health care law finds that it will 
increase the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars in the first 10 
years alone.
  Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin has 
testified the law will increase the deficit by at least $500 billion in 
its first 10 years and more than $1.5 trillion over the decade 
thereafter.
  At a time of severe budgetary constraints, there's only one place to 
turn in order to keep up with this spending: the wallets of Americans, 
in the form of tax increases.
  Having spent almost 30 years in the nonprofit health care field, I am 
acutely aware of the challenges many face when it comes to obtaining 
reasonably priced health care.
  While many of us agree there are portions of the law that are 
beneficial, such as the ability of adult dependent children up to age 
26 to stay on their parents' insurance, the elimination of excluding 
those with preexisting conditions from the plan and the expansion of 
low-cost clinics into underserved areas, the approach of the Affordable 
Care Act is fundamentally flawed. The law places Uncle Sam between 
doctors and patients when it should be the American people, not 
Washington bureaucrats, determining the kind of health care coverage 
that best suits their needs.
  Over the past 2 years, as the regulations have rolled out and the 
American people continue to learn what really is in the law, the broken 
promises have continued to pile up, weighing on the backs of small 
businesses and families. That's why we must repeal the law and toss out 
the negatives; move forward with reforms that actually lower costs 
without sacrificing quality and liberty.
  This week, just blocks away from this Chamber, the Supreme Court will 
hear arguments on the constitutionality of this law. While the Court's 
decision is months away, the verdict has already been cast by the 
countless American families and small businesses in congressional 
districts across this great country that simply cannot afford the so-
called Affordable Care Act.

                    DO NOT REPEAL HEALTH CARE REFORM

  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, there will be no repeal of the health 
care reform law, so let's be clear. The agenda that the Republican 
leadership has set for this week's floor activity and the committee 
work that follows is nothing more than an opportunity to bad talk and 
fuel the misinformation about the Affordable Care Act which is a good 
law that will help over 30 million people be healthier, create millions 
of jobs, make our country more productive and stronger, and reduce the 
deficit.
  So I am urging all of my colleagues, but especially those on the 
other side of the aisle, in the name of collegiality and honesty with 
the public we serve, to drop the charade and let us use the time the 
people of this country have hired us for to work together to create 
more jobs and make sure the health care law is implemented properly, to 
save the homes of families, and to create an educational system that 
will once again make our children the first in the world.

                              OBAMA CARES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
Wilson) for 30 minutes.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this is my own little ``non-
filibuster'' in the House of Representatives. I simply cannot stay 
quiet when a crowning achievement for the American people is under 
attack.
  The term ``ObamaCare'' was coined by Republicans in 2010 to mock the 
Affordable Care Act. Well, this is one place where I agree with the 
Republicans. I believe that ObamaCare is the perfect name for the 
Affordable Care Act because the Affordable Care Act is proof that Obama 
cares. He cares about

[[Page H5881]]

America's families. He cares about mothers. He cares about fathers. He 
cares about young people. He cares about babies. He cares about 
seniors. He cares about the future of the American people. Yes, Obama 
cares.
  We know that Obama cares because insurance companies can no longer 
deny 17 million children with preexisting conditions health coverage. 
We know that Obama cares because 105 million Americans with life-
threatening diseases no longer have to live in fear of maxing out on 
their lifetime dollar limits on their insurance coverage. We know that 
Obama cares because more than 3 million young people up to age 26 can 
now have coverage because insurance companies can no longer remove them 
from their parents' plans.
  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say that the people in Congress who 
oppose ObamaCare do not care, but I need help in understanding this 
dilemma. Where do they live? Who do they represent? Who could oppose 
health care for their constituents?
  The opponents of ObamaCare have not proposed a single serious 
alternative to provide health care coverage. Their constituents get 
sick, too. Have these Members of Congress ever been sick? Have they 
ever had a sick family member without insurance coverage? Have they 
ever been to a public emergency room? They should be afraid for their 
neighbors, their friends and family who may someday become jobless, 
uninsured, and sick. They will lose everything that they own.
  Who do these people represent? Do they represent robots? Do they 
feel? Do they bleed? Do they have pain?
  Members of Congress should be encouraging people to get coverage and 
expand access to health care. We can stop the crisis of uninsurance 
that is killing people, draining our tax dollars, and degrading our 
health system. Instead, too many legislators are spreading myths and 
half-truths about the only plausible plan that exists right now to end 
our health care crisis.
  ObamaCare is not a government takeover. To the contrary, it is an 
improvement on our private, free market-oriented health care system. 
You will have choices. You will have access. If you are unemployed with 
no health care, you will likely get it. If you are employed with health 
care, you will likely experience no change in your present health care 
coverage. If you are on Medicare, do not be frightened. You will 
experience no changes in your Medicare coverage.
  The Federal Government is simply making it easier and cheaper for 
people who have no insurance to get insured. The Federal Government 
will subsidize your health care bills according to your income status. 
ObamaCare is trying to ensure that no one's livelihood is destroyed by 
a serious illness.
  When I was an elementary school principal, I worked to help a 
homeless family whose children were attending my school. The father was 
a professional man--an optician--whose lifetime was destroyed when he 
hit his lifetime cap for health care coverage because of 
serious medical conditions related to sickle cell anemia. They 
suffered. They lost everything--their home, their dignity, their 
health. The whole school joined in to help them through this crisis. 
This family was forced to work incredibly hard to survive. They would 
not have had to face such a hardship if the Affordable Care Act 
protections were in place.

  We know that ObamaCare is about women because pregnancy can no longer 
be considered a preexisting condition. We know that ObamaCare is about 
young people because young people--the likeliest to be involved in auto 
crashes or motorcycle crashes or drug use--will be insured. They are 
not invincible, as they so often believe. As it stands now, someone has 
to pick up the tab when they make a mistake. They need to be insured.
  Have you been to a public emergency room lately? It's a nightmare. 
People everywhere are suffering, waiting endlessly for their turn. So 
many of these patients are not insured and cannot pay. Not only do they 
suffer, but the taxpayers and public health system also suffer. The 
costs are passed on down the line. What a relief it would be for our 
public hospitals and for the taxpayers if we could ensure that every 
person in America that was eligible has health insurance.
  This is about fiscal responsibility. People want to be insured. They 
want the peace of mind and stability. ObamaCare is about the economic 
future of this Nation because the Affordable Care Act ensures that 
Americans pay for all the health care services they use. Preventive 
care would save so much money and save so many lives.
  Mr. Speaker, no one said that this would be easy. Progress is never 
easy. We went through this struggle with Social Security in 1935. 
Before Social Security, senior citizens suffered and died in poverty. 
Social Security provoked a tremendous backlash from conservatives. 
Members of Congress even fought to strip domestic workers and 
agricultural workers of their benefits in order to keep African 
Americans out of the system. We had to fight, but we ultimately 
succeeded in building a Social Security system that keeps tens of 
millions of Americans out of poverty. We have come a long way.
  We went through this struggle with Medicare in 1965. Back then, 
Republicans, including then-California Governor Ronald Reagan, declared 
that Medicare was a ``Soviet-style health model'' and the end of 
freedom in America. But we ultimately succeeded in building a health 
care system for the elderly that prevents untold suffering and death.
  ObamaCare is about 30 million lives. October 1, 2013. It's about 
marching forward in the proud tradition of Social Security and 
Medicare. It's about marching toward the goal of a society that truly 
cherishes human life.
  Nobody said that it would be easy. We knew it would be difficult. We 
knew it would be hard. We've been here before. We fought hard--and we 
won. And we're on our way to another crowning achievement in the 
history of this Nation, simply because Barack Hussein Obama cares.
  I yield back the balance of my time.

               REGARDING THE PATIENTS' RIGHTS REPEAL ACT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I wanted a moment to reflect. This was 
a very sad day for me. Having been here during the emotional time 
during the debate on the Affordable Care Act, remembering the long 
hours and the deliberation in the committees in regular order, the 
opportunity for Republicans to offer amendments, and then today for the 
37th time this particular act has now hurt millions of Americans.
  My State is number one. Today, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to call the roll 
and ask those citizens of those States to call their Senators. For how 
can you vote for such a repeal of the Patients' Rights Act when Texas, 
Louisiana, Nevada, California, Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, Alaska, 
Mississippi, and Oklahoma all have uninsured over 20 percent, with 
Texas being 28.4 percent?
  It is poverty that drives the need to expand Medicaid to my State, to 
my Governor. It is poverty that drives this. Whether you are poor, 
whether you are low-income, whether you are working middle class, the 
Affordable Care Act is to lift your boat to give you the opportunity to 
have preventive health care to be able to have access to doctors. Why 
would anybody vote to repeal the Patients' Rights Act?

                      PREEMIE ACT REAUTHORIZATION

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the PREEMIE Act 
reauthorization, which will be considered in the House under 
suspensions later today.
  I am grateful for the support of my Tennessee Senator Lamar 
Alexander,

[[Page H6960]]

who has brought this legislation in the Senate, and I cosponsored a 
House version of it.
  I am also the sponsor of the NEWBORN Act, a bill aimed at reducing 
infant mortality rates around our country that will be introduced soon.
  My interest in this is because this is important for our future. 
America, unfortunately, is way back in the countries on infant 
mortality. Memphis, unfortunately, is a leader in that situation where 
we have a tremendously high infant mortality rate that rivals Third 
World countries.
  The PREEMIE Act's many provisions aimed at reducing the rate of 
infant mortality are vital to having a better Nation.
  Like the PREEMIE Act, the Affordable Care Act has made great strides 
in advancing this agenda by requiring maternity coverage in all health 
plans. The United States has a long way to go, but legislation like the 
PREEMIE Act, the NEWBORN Act, and the Affordable Care Act can put the 
United States on the right track where it needs to be in the rates of 
premature births and infant mortality.

                GOOD NEWS ABOUT MEDICARE AND HEALTH CARE

  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I have some excellent news to 
share. Just last week, the CMS' independent actuary released an 
analysis of the health care reform legislation that we passed last 
month here in this Chamber. Their report shows that we are 
strengthening Medicare.
  Indeed, according to the Office of the Actuary, the Affordable Care 
Act will help extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by an 
additional 12 years to 2029, compared to 2017 today. It closes the 
prescription drug doughnut hole by 2020, with an immediate rebate this 
year of $250 and a 50-percent discount on brand-name drugs next year. 
It lowers annual premiums by nearly $200 per beneficiary. It lowers 
annual average coinsurance by over $200 per beneficiary, and it 
provides preventive wellness care visits for free.
  When we passed health care reform, Democrats stood up for seniors by 
strengthening Medicare and closing the prescription drug doughnut hole 
that was wide open and would be left wide open under the Republicans' 
plan. Under their radical plan to repeal health care, we will move in 
the wrong direction.

          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. CORNYN:
  S. 1315. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from 
enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health 
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; read the first time.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of 
the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

                                S. 1315

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the IRS Off Your Health 
     Care Act of 2013''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) On May 10, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service admitted 
     that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, 
     seeking tax-exempt status.
       (2) This action raises pertinent questions about the 
     agency's ability to implement and oversee the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and 
     the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 
     (Public Law 111-152).
       (3) This action could be an indication of future Internal 
     Revenue Service abuses in relation to the Patient Protection 
     and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
     Reconciliation Act of 2010, given that it is their 
     responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual 
     mandate.
       (4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, 
     and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the 
     Federal Government.

     SEC. 3. PROHIBITING ENFORCEMENT OF PPACA AND HCERA.

       The Secretary of the Treasury, or any delegate of the 
     Secretary, shall not implement or enforce any provisions of 
     or amendments made by the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act (Public Law 111-148) or the Health Care and 
     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152).
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. CORNYN:
  S. 1316. A bill to repeal the provisions of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act providing for the Independent Payment Advisory 
Board; read the first time.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of 
the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

                                S. 1316

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Seniors' Access 
     to Medicare Act of 2013''.

     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF THE INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD.

       Effective as of the enactment of the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), sections 3403 and 
     10320 of such Act (including the amendments made by such 
     sections) are repealed, and any provision of law amended by 
     such sections is hereby restored as if such sections had not 
     been enacted into law.

     IMPROVE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY, ACCESS, QUALITY AND CHOICE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we must improve health 
care affordability, access, quality and choice. We must not, however, 
pass a sweeping government takeover of health care.
  We should just fix what is broken. Medical liability and defensive 
medicine costs are broken.
  Mr. Speaker, we need tort reform. The economic and professional 
consequences of medical liability lawsuits are driving the practice of 
defensive medicine.
  Here are the facts: medical liability premiums in the United States 
have reached $26 billion a year. The average award is $4.7 million. 
More than 93 percent of Pennsylvania physicians reported engaging in 
defensive medicine.
  I have cosponsored H.R. 3400, the Empowering Patients First Act, that 
provides tort reform. There will be no limit to actual economic damages 
to the patient. There would be a limitation on punitive damages, and 
they would be determined by a special health care panel that would have 
judges with health care expertise.
  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3400 for a first step towards 
real health care reform.

 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 39--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS 
  THAT STABLE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF AN 
  EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR THE PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND CARE OF HUMAN 
   IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD MAKE A 
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING 
    AS A RESPONSE TO THE ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME PANDEMIC

  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs:

                            S. Con. Res. 39

       Whereas adequate and secure housing for people with human 
     immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
     (referred to in this resolution as ``HIV/AIDS'') is a 
     challenge with global dimensions, and adequate housing is one 
     of the greatest unmet needs of people in the United States 
     with HIV/AIDS;
       Whereas growing empirical evidence shows that the 
     socioeconomic status and structural factors such as access to 
     adequate housing are key determinants of health;
       Whereas the link between poverty, disparities in the risk 
     of human immunodeficiency virus (referred to in this 
     resolution as ``HIV'') infection, and health outcomes is well 
     established, and new research demonstrates the direct 
     relationship between inadequate housing and greater risk of 
     HIV infection, poor health outcomes, and early death;
       Whereas rates of HIV infection are 3 to 16 times higher 
     among people who are homeless or have an unstable housing 
     situation, 70 percent of all people living with HIV/AIDS 
     report an experience of homelessness or housing instability 
     during their lifetime, and the HIV/AIDS death rate is 7 to 9 
     times higher for homeless adults than for the general 
     population;
       Whereas poor living conditions, including overcrowding and 
     homelessness, undermine safety, privacy, and efforts to 
     promote self-respect, human dignity, and responsible sexual 
     behavior;
       Whereas people who are homeless or have an unstable housing 
     situation are 2 to 6 times more likely to use hard drugs, 
     share needles, or exchange sex for money and housing than 
     similar persons with stable housing, because the lack of 
     stable housing directly impacts the ability of people living 
     in poverty to reduce HIV risk behaviors;
       Whereas, in spite of the evidence indicating that adequate 
     housing has a direct positive effect on HIV prevention, 
     treatment, and health outcomes, the housing resources devoted 
     to the national response to HIV/AIDS have been inadequate, 
     and housing has been largely ignored in policy discussions at 
     the international level; and
       Whereas, in 1990, Congress recognized the housing needs of 
     people with HIV/AIDS when it enacted the AIDS Housing 
     Opportunity Act (42 U.S.C. 12901 et seq.), commonly referred 
     to as the ``Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS 
     Program'' or ``HOPWA Program'', as part of the Cranston-
     Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Public Law 101-
     625), and the HOPWA program currently serves approximately 
     70,000 households: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--
       (1) stable and affordable housing is an essential component 
     of an effective strategy for HIV prevention, treatment, and 
     care; and
       (2) the United States should make a commitment to providing 
     adequate funding for the development of housing as a response 
     to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic.

                           HEALTH ACT OF 2011

  (Mr. FLAKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the legislation 
we'll vote on shortly to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board 
created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This is 
something that simply should not have been done. These are unelected 
board members, 15 of them, appointed by the President, tasked for 
finding savings and making recommendations.
  Unfortunately, because of the limitations of what the board can cut, 
the majority of spending reductions will come from cutting 
reimbursements for doctors and those who care for Medicare patients. 
The ultimate result will be fewer options for patients when doctors are 
driven out of the Medicare system.
  We were told when the Affordable Care Act was passed that it would 
lead to a reduction in premiums. It's done exactly the opposite.
  This kind of board and these kinds of decisions made by unelected 
officials will simply drive the cost up further, and we cannot afford 
to do that.
  My only regret in today's action is that we're not repealing the 
entire act. I hope that comes soon.

                          ____________________

                  PROTECTING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE ACT

  (Mr. BASS of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BASS of New Hampshire. Madam Speaker, today the Congress will 
take up H.R. 5, Protecting Access to Healthcare Act. Amongst other 
things, this bill will repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 
one of the many ill-conceived provisions that was part of the so-called 
Affordable Care Act. This independent advisory board basically has 
charged 15 unelected individuals with making decisions about what's 
covered for both patients below the age of 65 and Medicare recipients. 
It is the Affordable Care Act's way of reducing costs, i.e., telling 
doctors and patients what they can do and what they can't do. Fifteen 
unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., are going to tell you what 
you can do. They stand ahead of you and your doctor.
  Now, this bill did not make it to the floor last year. It will make 
it to the floor this year with bipartisan support. It costs $3.1 
billion, which is made up with a tort law reform provision which has 
been added. But that shows that $3.1 billion is what's saved by denying 
Americans access to health care that they've purchased or that they 
deserve. Join me in repealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board.

                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. MEEKS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, really I felt compelled to come because let's 
really talk about what this is. This is the 44th time to try to deny 
people access to health care. That is what it is.
  If you listened to some of my colleagues, you would think that all 
Americans are being denied health care coverage. Number one, we are 
talking about 5 percent, and 5 percent is too much. So what the 
President did today was to say that we are going to make sure that 
those individuals who have lost their coverage, if the insurance 
companies will stand up, they will do the right thing.
  What this says is that what we know is that there are 36 States, most 
of them headed by Republicans, that have already decided they didn't 
want to get involved; they didn't want State exchanges. So they wanted 
to make sure to deny individuals who have preexisting diseases.
  You could come and talk about the people who are saying, Thank you, 
Mr. President, for the Affordable Care Act. Because of my preexisting 
condition, I had been turned down by insurance companies. With 
Affordable Care, that won't happen.
  Young people who don't have insurance, up to age 26, they will still 
be covered because of the Affordable Care Act.
  What this is is a process and an attempt to try to end the Affordable 
Care Act for the 44th time. Let's not do that. Let's give the people 
the right to health care.

                           VOTE ON A CLEAN CR

  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, while Republicans are trying to 
destroy the Affordable Care Act, the American people are embracing it--
and have been for the past 3 years. Even my district, which is rightly 
upset over not being included in the exchanges like other Americans, 
has benefited.
  Let me tell you a story I heard from one of our doctors.
  According to one doctor, the preventive care without copays and 26-
year-olds being able to stay on their parents' insurance has helped 
keep her practice afloat. The up-to-35 percent tax credit for small 
businesses and the rebate from insurance companies that didn't meet 
their medical loss ratio allowed her to relieve her employees of their 
portion of the health insurance premiums. This, and many other ways, is 
how the Affordable Care Act is working in my community.
  Like a few other places in the law, fixes may be needed, like for the 
territories. The President and Democrats will address them, but in a 
rational manner.
  So I am calling on my Republican colleagues to end the hostage-taking 
of this Congress, of our Federal employees, of our economy, and the 
good faith and credit of our Nation. Don't fight us. Join us. Support 
the Affordable Care Act--a good law that is expanding access to 
affordable health care for all of us. When some of us benefit, all of 
us benefit.
  Let's vote on a clean CR, open up our government, and lift the debt 
ceiling today.

[Page H36]
            By Mr. GARRETT:
        H.R. 105.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 (The Congress shall have 
     Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, 
     to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and 
     general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts 
     and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;), 
     Article I, Section 9, Clause 5 (No Capitation, or other 
     direct, Tax shall be laid unless in Proportion to the Census 
     or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken), and 
     Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 (To make all Laws which shall 
     be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the 
     foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this 
     Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in 
     any Department of Officer thereof).
       In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 
     the Supreme Court ruled that the financial penalty for 
     failing to purchase health insurance as mandated by the 
     Affordable Care Act is a tax that Congress may impose through 
     the taxing power. Even if the penalty imposed by the 
     Affordable Care Act must be construed to be a tax, it does 
     not satisfy the three types of taxes--income, excise, or 
     direct--that are listed as valid in the Constitution. The 
     penalty is not assessed on income so it is not a valid income 
     tax. The penalty is not assessed uniformly and is triggered 
     by economic inactivity so it is not a valid excise tax. 
     Finally, the penalty is not apportioned among the states by 
     population and therefore is not a valid direct tax.
       The tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act, by every 
     measure, extends beyond the taxing power granted to Congress 
     by the Constitution and it is only necessary and proper that 
     Congress repeal the individual mandate.

                                 ______

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 12, 2010

  Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, on August 17, 2009, I became a cosponsor 
of H.R. 3590, the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act. This 
legislation, which passed the House of Representatives on October 8, 
2009, by a vote of 416 to 0, was designed to make certain changes in 
the tax code to assist members of the military in becoming homeowners. 
Thankfully, the legal changes envisioned in H.R. 3590 were included in 
a different bill to extend the first-time homebuyer tax credit that 
received bipartisan support and was signed into law by the President.
  After the military tax issue was resolved, the Senate Majority Leader 
used H.R. 3590 as the legislative vehicle to pass health care reform. 
On December 23, 2009, the Senate adopted a manager's amendment to H.R. 
3590 which removed the provisions of the bill as it passed the House 
and replaced them with provisions of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act. The amendment also changed the title of the bill.
  A public search of legislation I have cosponsored in the 111th 
Congress shows that I am a cosponsor of the original H.R. 3590. I take 
this opportunity to clarify that I cosponsored and voted for the 
Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act, not the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act.

[Pages S1988-S1991]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I would like to join many of my 
colleagues who are each talking a little bit about the affordable care 
act, which celebrates its second anniversary of being signed into law 
by the President tomorrow. Even though the law will not be fully 
implemented until 2014, millions of Americans and Minnesotans are 
already enjoying the benefits from important provisions in the law.
  For example, no child in Minnesota, no child in New Hampshire, and no 
child in America can now be denied health insurance coverage because he 
or she has a preexisting condition. Parents across Minnesota and around 
the country can sleep a little bit easier knowing that if their child 
gets sick, they will still be able to get the health care coverage they 
need. That is a big deal.
  Speaking of parents, young adults can now stay on their parents' 
health insurance until they are 26. Thanks to the affordable care act, 
32,189 young adults in Minnesota are now insured on their parents' 
policy. Because of this law health insurance companies can no longer 
impose lifetime limits on health care benefits.
  Just a few weeks ago, I heard from a Minnesotan in his thirties who 
has hemophilia. He had already hit his lifetime cap three times, but 
because of the health care reform law he still has insurance. No 
American can ever again have their health insurance taken away from 
them because they have reached some arbitrary lifetime limit, and I am 
proud of that.
  Let's talk about seniors. I go to a lot of senior centers around my 
State. I know the Presiding Officer goes to senior citizen centers 
around New Hampshire. Because of the health care law more than 57,000 
seniors in Minnesota receive a 50-percent discount on their covered 
brand-name prescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole, at an 
average savings of $590 per senior. By 2020, the law will close the 
doughnut hole entirely. You know who likes that--seniors. You know what 
else seniors like--the fact that in 2011, 424,000 Minnesotans with 
Medicare received preventive services without copays, such as 
colonoscopies and mammograms and free annual wellness visits with their 
doctors. I could go on and on with what we have already gained, but I 
wish to talk a little bit about a provision I wrote with the catchy 
name ``medical loss ratio,'' which is sometimes called the 80/20 rule 
because of my medical loss ratio provision which I based on a Minnesota 
law.
  Health insurance companies must spend 80 to 85 percent of their 
premiums on actual health care. This is 85 percent for large group 
policies, 80 percent for small group and individual policies on actual 
health care, not on administrative costs, marketing, advertisements, 
CEO salaries, profits but on actual health care. We have already heard 
the medical loss ratio provision is working. The plan is already 
lowering premiums in order for companies to comply with the law. For 
example, Aetna in Connecticut lowered their premiums on an average of 
10 percent because of this provision in the law.
  Another key provision in the law is the value index. The value index 
rewards doctors for the quality of the care they deliver, not the 
quantity--for the value of the care, not the volume.
  My home State, Minnesota, is a leader--if not the leader--in 
delivering high-value care at a relatively low cost. Traditionally, in 
Minnesota, our health care providers have been well underreimbursed for 
it. For example, Texas gets reimbursed 50 percent more per Medicare 
patient than Minnesota does. This isn't about pitting Minnesota against 
Texas or Florida, it is about rewarding those low-valued States to 
become more like Minnesota.
  Imagine if we brought down Medicare expenditures by 30 percent around 
the country while increasing its effectiveness. It will bring enormous 
benefits not just to Minnesota but across the country because it will 
bring down the cost of health care delivery nationwide, and that is 
what we need to be addressing, the cost of health care delivery, 
because we all know bringing down the health care costs is key to 
getting our long-term deficits in order. In fact, there is probably 
nothing more important that we can do. That is where the value index is 
so important.

  I have gone over a number of the benefits from health care reform 
that have already kicked in, but I obviously didn't mention them all. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, health care reform has already 
added jobs to our economy. I barely touched on the great stuff that 
kicks in, in 2014, such as the exchanges which will allow individuals 
and small businesses to pool with others to get more affordable health 
insurance that is the right fit for them. Of course, while presently no 
child can be denied health insurance for preexisting conditions, 
starting in 2014 no American will be denied health insurance or 
penalized for having a preexisting condition.
  The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency of Congress, 
has crunched the numbers and reported that the affordable care act will 
insure 31 million additional Americans and bring down our national 
deficit by billions of dollars in its first 10 years and by 
approximately $1 trillion in its second 10 years.
  I ask the American people not to fall victim to disinformation. There 
are no death panels. The affordable care act cuts the deficit. Under 
this law, businesses under 50 employees don't have to provide insurance 
for their employees and will not suffer penalties if they don't. They 
will not have to pay fines and they will not be dragged into prison. 
There is so much junk out there that is just plain false, and it is 
doing everyone in this country a giant disservice.
  My colleagues and I disagree on many things. Can we all at least 
agree to talk about this law in a factual manner? The benefits of this 
law are tremendous and Americans across the country are already 
experiencing it. I urge all my colleagues to acknowledge these benefits 
and to support the continued implementation of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act.
  (The remarks of Mr. Franken pertaining to the introduction of S. 2225 
are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills 
and Joint Resolutions.'')
  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, the anniversary of any new law should 
be a time to celebrate accomplishments and new landmarks. But the 
almost constant flow of bad news, unfavorable reports, and broken 
promises makes the second anniversary of the health care law anything 
but a celebration. Rather, it is something that even the White House 
seems embarrassed to mention.
  The truth is the policy behind the bill was flawed. The truth is that 
the law is fundamentally flawed. It raises taxes and health care costs 
for working Americans. It puts bureaucrats between patients and their 
doctors. It tangles our Nation's job creators in regulations and 
redtape, and it defies

[[Page S1989]]

our country's most sacred document--the Constitution of the United 
States.
  Next week, the U.S. Supreme Court begins hearings to determine 
whether the health care law violates the Constitution. It is one of the 
most important cases reviewed in recent history. The Court has set 
aside a remarkable 6 hours for oral arguments--more time than has been 
devoted to a case in over four decades. Its ruling will have a far-
reaching impact on our health care system, but it doesn't stop there. 
It will have a far-reaching impact on our economy, and fundamentally on 
the expanse of congressional authority over the individual citizen.
  I hope the Supreme Court will resolve the countless problems in this 
law for good by striking it down in its entirety.
  The facts tell us that with the passage of time, things have not 
gotten better with this law; they have, in fact, gotten worse. Take 
last week's report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as 
one example. We learned something about the cost of this bill. Before 
the bill was passed, many of us were saying this bill was filled with 
budget gimmicks to make it look cheaper to the American people than it 
was. Well, we learned that the cost of the law's coverage provisions 
alone is projected to balloon to $1.7 trillion.
  The problem is that CBO only does 10-year projections, so the major 
provisions of this law were delayed until 2014. Why? Well, the reason 
for that is it was done to mask the true costs of this bill when it was 
fully implemented. When we eliminate gimmicks such as this and consider 
the law's first 10 years of full implementation, I fully expect the 
total cost of this legislation will not be the $900 billion promised by 
President Obama, it will be $2.6 trillion. This law certainly doesn't 
bend the cost curve down.
  CBO concludes that families buying insurance on their own will pay an 
astounding $2,100 more a year for that insurance. Yet then-Candidate 
Obama promised that Americans would see their premiums decrease by 
$2,500 by the end of his first term.
  The recent CBO report also noted that the Federal Government will 
spend $168 billion more on Medicaid compared to last year's estimate.
  The truth keeps coming out. That means more people will be trapped in 
a broken program where waiting lines will, in fact, be longer, 
emergency room visits will be more frequent, because that is the only 
place they can find care, health care outcomes will get worse, and 40 
percent of physicians today won't even see patients in this program.
  This law does not deliver better quality health care either. Imposing 
Medicaid on more people is like giving someone a ticket to ride a bus 
that has broken down hundreds of miles away but claiming they have a 
ticket so, in fact, they have the opportunity for transportation. Not 
only that, the law puts all the pressure and burden on our States to 
implement the Medicaid Program's largest expansion since 1965, placing 
$118 billion in unfunded mandates on States, when our States are 
struggling to figure out how they balance their budgets today. As a 
former Governor who has balanced budgets, I believe this expansion 
dumped on our States to manage is a critical and fatal flaw of this 
legislation.
  CBO also recently projected that up to 20 million more working 
Americans could lose their employer-sponsored health care coverage 
because of this health care law. That is an incredible shift, 
especially when we consider that our President promised no fewer than 
47 different times: ``If you like your plan, you can keep it.''

  In addition to a potential 20 million employees losing their current 
coverage, 7 million seniors are likely to lose their Medicare Advantage 
plans. According to the Congressional Budget Office Director, more than 
3,200 Nebraskans enrolled in Medicare Advantage will, in fact, have 
their benefits cut in half. Families in 17 States, including Nebraska, 
no longer have access to child-only health insurance because of 
mandates in the law.
  Wait a second. I just said in 17 States they no longer have access to 
a child-only health insurance policy because of this law's effect. That 
is incredible.
  Our Nebraska insurance commissioner called this collapse of the 
child-only market ``an example of the unintended consequences of this 
imperfect law.''
  Here we see the President's promise, again, flipped on its head: This 
law forces you to say goodbye to the coverage you like for children.
  Over the past 2 years, I have traveled across the great State of 
Nebraska hosting townhalls, roundtables, and meetings, and I am finding 
that the more folks know about this law, the more they detest it. 
Religious schools and hospitals and charities are troubled because the 
law will force them to violate their deeply held beliefs. Seniors are 
concerned that the law will limit access to care because it siphons 
$500 billion from Medicare and uses it as a piggy bank to spend on 
other government programs.
  The administration's own Medicare Actuary has projected ``the prices 
paid by Medicare for health services are very likely to fall 
increasingly short of the costs of providing these services.'' The CMS 
Actuary continued that these Medicare cuts could result in ``severe 
problems with beneficiary access to care.''
  Let me translate that. That means this law will make it more 
difficult for senior citizens to get health care because the Federal 
Government is not paying its way. Others wonder what the 159 new boards 
established by this law will mean for access to health care, and hard-
working Nebraskans question how the law's $\1/2\ trillion in taxes will 
affect their families. Approximately 428,000 Nebraskan households 
making less than $200,000 will pay higher taxes--approximately 428,000. 
That is based on estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
  Small businesses across Nebraska have shared with me that they are 
holding off on hiring because of the mandates in this legislation. At a 
roundtable last week, business men and women expressed their concerns 
about the law's tax on health insurance companies in the fully insured 
market, and with good reason. The health insurance tax alone could 
impose $87 billion in costs on businesses and their employees over the 
law's first 10 years alone.
  An analysis by the National Federation of Independent Business 
indicates this law will force the private sector--will force the 
private sector--to cut between 124,000 and 249,000 jobs between now and 
2021. That is not just a statistic, those are families who will lose a 
job because of this health care bill.
  It is remarkable that in the midst of our economic situation, the 
President's signature legislation actually reduces jobs. These are some 
of the many reasons Nebraskans are demanding louder than ever that this 
law be repealed.
  Now, some of the law's supporters have taken up the mantra: Well, 
don't repeal it, repair it. That is a nice slogan. This law, though, is 
so fatally flawed no bandaid is ever going to fix it.
  I experienced firsthand how difficult it is to change this law when I 
worked to repeal the 1099 reporting requirement, which nearly everybody 
agreed was idiotic. It would have increased paperwork burdens on our 
Nation's job creators by up to 2,000 percent.
  The administration even agreed this pay-for in their law needed to 
go, and, in the end, 87 Senators supported full repeal of the 
provision. But it took 9 months and 7 votes before my efforts to repeal 
a provision that everybody agreed was idiotic was finally successful. 
So anyone who tells you we can tinker with the law to fix it might as 
well offer you ocean-front property in the State of Nebraska.
  The 2,700-page law is one of the largest pieces of legislation ever 
passed in this Nation's history. Its provisions are interconnected, 
ill-fated, and far-reaching, and they will affect every single American 
economically, socially, and physically. We cannot sit idly by and allow 
for the negative consequences to continue unraveling, and they will.
  As I said, I hope the Supreme Court strikes down this entire law. But 
if it does not, we will continue our fight to repeal it, as Nebraskans 
demand that I do. We must protect the rights of Americans to choose 
their doctors, to select their insurance, to trust their care, and to 
protect their conscience rights. We must ensure employers see reforms 
that reduce regulations and redtape and instead increase efficiencies 
and address the underlying costs. We must give States the flexibility 
to run their Medicaid Program in

[[Page S1990]]

the best way that serves the needs of those vulnerable populations in 
that State.
  This law is misguided. It stifles job growth and does not improve 
health care for millions of Americans, and it should be wiped off the 
books. Americans are demanding it, Nebraskans are demanding it, and 
they deserve that.
  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 years ago this week, President Obama 
signed into law the affordable care act. This landmark act will extend 
health insurance coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans in the next 
few years. Reform based on good-quality and affordable health 
insurance, talked about for decades, is finally becoming a reality. 
Over 15 months, Congress debated and then passed the most sweeping and 
comprehensive reforms to improve the everyday lives of every American 
since Congress passed Medicare in 1965. It was an arduous process, but 
in the end this achievement proved that change is possible and that the 
voices of so many Americans who over the years have called on their 
leaders to act have finally been heard.
  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of 
insurance reform. Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions 
are starting to receive help when trapped within a coverage gap known 
as the ``doughnut hole.'' The affordable care act completely closes the 
coverage gap by 2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to 
afford prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7000 
Vermonters received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their 
prescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year, nearly 
6800 Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their 
covered brand-name prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of 
$714 per person. Since the affordable care act was signed into law, 
more than 4000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance 
coverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their 
parents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are 
seeing in Vermont go on and on: 81,649 Vermonters on Medicare and more 
than 100,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and 
received preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay. 
These are just a few of the dozens of consumer protections included in 
the law that are benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day.
  Now that the law is in effect, many of the essential 
antidiscrimination and consumer protections of the affordable care act 
are being implemented, allowing consumers to take control of their own 
health care decisions. Known as the Patients' Bill of Rights, these 
rules protect consumers against the worst health insurance industry 
abuses that have prevented millions of people from receiving the health 
care they need. Going forward, insurance plans can no longer deny 
children coverage because of a preexisting health condition; insurance 
plans are barred from dropping beneficiaries from coverage simply 
because of an illness; dozens of preventive care services must be 
covered at no cost and with no copay; and Americans will have access to 
an easier appeals process for private medical claims that are denied.
  Yet another major reform now protects hard-working Americans from one 
of the most egregious insurance industry practices: setting lifetime or 
annual limits on health insurance coverage. Before this change in the 
law, wherever I traveled in Vermont, I was often stopped in the grocery 
store, at church, on the street, or at the gas station by Vermonters 
who shared their personal, wrenching stories about how they could no 
longer get medical treatment because they had met their annual or 
lifetime maximum. Many of these Vermonters were perfectly healthy 
before being diagnosed with cancer or diseases that can cost well 
beyond their means for treatment. Instead of being able to focus on 
getting healthy, patients instead had to worry about whether their next 
doctor's visit will push them above the insurance company's arbitrary 
limit.
  Beginning in 2014, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to 
deny coverage to individuals with preexisting health conditions or to 
charge higher premiums based on health status or gender. We learned in 
a report issued by the National Women's Law Center this week that until 
these reforms are implemented, insurance companies are continuing to 
charge women higher premiums than men. In States where this practice is 
not prohibited, women can pay substantially more than men solely 
because of their gender. Those who wish to turn back the clock and 
repeal the affordable care act threaten to return the American people 
to a broken health insurance system where women can be charged more 
than men, children can be denied insurance coverage because they were 
born with a health condition, and individuals risk losing their health 
insurance solely for getting sick.
  In addition to these improvements to our health insurance system, 
over time the affordable care act will insure 93 percent of our 
population and make a substantial investment in our economic vitality 
in the years ahead. I was proud to work with Senator Grassley and 
others to include strong antifraud provisions in the law that have 
already helped prevent and detect fraudulent activities that in the 
past have cost American taxpayers millions of dollars each year. 
Despite the specious arguments from opponents of reform, this bill is 
the largest deficit reduction measure upon which many in Congress will 
ever cast a vote. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 
comprehensive reform will reduce the Federal deficit by $143 billion 
through 2019, and by more than $1 trillion in the decades to come.
  Regrettably, opponents of the affordable care act have sought to 
continue their political battle by challenging the landmark legislation 
in the courts, right from the moment President Obama signed it into 
law. These opponents seek to achieve in the courts what they could not 
in Congress. They want judges to override legislative decisions 
properly assigned by the Constitution to Congress, the elected 
representatives of the American people.
  In my view, the partisan legal challenges to the affordable care act 
depend on legal theories so extreme they would not only undo the 
progress we have made in the affordable care act for kids, families, 
and senior citizens, they would turn back the clock even farther to the 
hardships of the Great Depression. They seek to strike down principles 
that have been settled for nearly three quarters of a century and have 
helped us build and secure the social safety net through Social 
Security, Medicare and Medicaid. These challenges to Congress's 
constitutional authority to enact the affordable care act have been 
rejected by three courts. Judges appointed by Republican Presidents and 
Democratic Presidents have rejected these challenges, and they were 
right to do so. Now the case is before the Supreme Court, which will 
hear arguments next week.
  I have joined congressional leaders in filing an amicus brief 
defending the affordable care act. I did so not only because I have 
fought for decades to secure affordable health care for all Americans 
but because I am convinced that Congress acted well within the limits 
of Article I of the Constitution in doing so. Before passing the 
affordable care act, Congress expressly considered and rejected 
arguments that the law, including the requirement that individuals have 
health insurance, is not constitutional. I believe we must defend the 
enumerated powers given to Congress by the Constitution so that our 
ability to help protect hard-working American workers, families, and 
consumers is not wrongly curtailed by the courts.
  What is telling about the partisan nature of these challenges is that 
many of those who now claim that the requirement that Americans have 
health insurance or face a tax penalty is unconstitutional are the very 
ones who proposed it. Republican Senators like Senator Hatch, the 
former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Grassley, the 
ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, proposed a health insurance 
requirement as an alternative when they opposed President Clinton's 
plan to provide access for all Americans to health care. They were for 
the individual mandate until President Obama was for it, and now they 
are against it. Their views may have changed, but the Constitution has 
not. What they fail to mention are the consequences of removing this 
provision. If individuals are not required to have health insurance, 
then they will wait

[[Page S1991]]

until they are sick to get coverage, driving up the costs for everyone 
else in the meantime. This will mean that many of the consumer 
protections in the law, such as the ban on preexisting health 
conditions, would disappear, once again leaving millions uninsured. For 
sake of the health and security of our Nation, the Supreme Court should 
not cast aside this landmark law and Congress's time-honored ability to 
act on behalf of the American people.
  The affordable care act is a tremendous achievement that will improve 
the lives of Americans for generations to come. For decades, we have 
heard heartbreaking stories about the enormous challenges Americans 
face because they are uninsured or underinsured. With each year that we 
move forward to implement the features of the affordable care act, 
these stories are becoming fewer and fewer and are being replaced by 
stories of the success of these reforms, one family at a time, all 
across Vermont and all across America.
  There is still much more to accomplish, and there are still millions 
of Americans who are struggling to buy or keep adequate health 
insurance coverage for their families or themselves. As these reforms 
are implemented over the next few years, I will continue to work with 
Vermonters and the Department of Health and Human Services to help 
Americans have the access to the quality, affordable health insurance 
that each and every American needs and deserves.
  I yield the floor.

    REPEALING MANDATORY FUNDING FOR STATE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                       HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 3, 2011

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1213) to 
     repeal mandatory funding provided to States in the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act to establish American 
     Health Benefit Exchanges:

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1213.
  This bill would eliminate funding for a key component of the 
Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion--the State-based health 
insurance Exchanges.
  The Exchanges are the chief vehicle through which we will give 
millions of individuals and small businesses--currently locked out of 
the market--access to affordable coverage.
  The Affordable Care Act provides each State with the flexibility to 
design its own Exchange--tailored to meet the needs of its residents, 
strengthen the private insurance market, and provide consumer 
protections.

[[Page E802]]

  This bill repeals the funding for the Exchanges and eliminates that 
flexibility.
  Repeal would deny Illinois and every other State the funding needed 
to setup a unique State solution for improving and fixing broken 
insurance markets.
  This bill undermines the work already being done in Illinois and, 
given the State budget situation, will likely mean Illinois would be 
unable to run its own State-based health insurance Exchange.
  In September, Illinois received a $1 million grant to begin planning 
and establishing its Exchange.
  Without funding to move to implementation, we won't have the 
resources to get our Exchange up and running and millions of 
Illinoisans will lose access to affordable, adequate health insurance 
coverage.

                     HON. LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 11, 2012

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, this bill will never become law, and it 
is a perfect symbol of the failure of this Congress.
  Over the last two years we've voted more than 30 times to mess with 
the healthcare reforms in the Affordable Care Act. This Congress could 
barely bring itself to pass a transportation bill, yet it found the 
time to vote on the same issue 30 times.
  The second biggest priority of this Congress appears to be the 
legislative war on women. We've taken at least 9 votes to take away 
rights and protections away from women, and specifically attacking 
women's health.
  In short, this Congress has spent two years actively working against 
the rights of women and healthcare of American families.
  Prior to the Affordable Care Act becoming law, being a woman was a 
pre-existing condition. Women were denied health insurance coverage 
because they were victims of domestic abuse, and when they were given 
health insurance coverage, they oftentimes paid more than men for the 
same level of care. Companies that have a large number of female 
employees faced higher healthcare costs than other companies--all 
because health insurance companies could, and did, get away with price 
discrimination.
  The Affordable Care Act finally gave women equal rights when it came 
to healthcare, and it is the reason I rise to defend that lifesaving 
legislation today. I strongly oppose the political charade that is 
being carried out here today--and on behalf of every woman who is no 
longer a second-class citizen, I urge my colleagues to vote against 
today's bill.

    HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO 
                           PROCEED--Continued

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.


                       Scholarships For Kids Act

  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this morning the Senator from South 
Carolina, Mr. Scott, and I went to the American Enterprise Institute 
and outlined two bills that together represent the most ambitious 
proposals ever to enable States to use Federal dollars to allow parents 
to find a better school for their child.
  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about my proposal, which 
is called the Scholarships for Kids Act, and the context in which we 
find ourselves today as we look forward to the President's State of the 
Union address. I would also like to briefly mention the

[[Page S506]]

proposal of Senator Scott from South Carolina. He has already 
introduced his bill. He will be on the floor at another time to talk 
about it. But these are big ideas. Together they represent redirecting 
about 35 billion Federal dollars that are now being spent through a 
series of programs and instead spend them in a way that better fits the 
age in which we find ourselves, an age in which the best Federal 
investments can be made in things that enable Americans to do things 
for ourselves to make our lives better and happier and safer and 
longer.
  Let me talk first about Scholarships for Kids. I ask unanimous 
consent that an article describing the bill be printed following my 
remarks.
  The legislation that I am introducing today would allow approximately 
11 million new Federal scholarships to follow low-income children to 
any school their parents choose as long as it is accredited. It is not 
a Federal mandate. It would enable States to create those choice 
options. But it would mean about a $2,100 scholarship of Federal 
dollars on top of the money that States already spend on elementary and 
secondary education for each child.
  The State of Tennessee, for example, spends nearly $8,000 per child 
on public elementary and secondary education. This would be providing a 
$2,100 scholarship to the one-fifth of students who are low income and 
allowing that money to follow them to the school they attend.
  Our country is united, not by race, but by a set of principles upon 
which we agree. One of the most important of these is the principle of 
equal opportunity. For me, equal opportunity means creating an 
environment where the largest number of people can begin at the same 
starting line. I believe this is a real answer to the inequality in 
America that we hear so much about, giving children more opportunity to 
attend a better school.
  The Scholarships for Kids Act will cost $24 billion a year. It will 
be paid for by redirecting about 41 percent of all the dollars we now 
directly spend on Federal elementary and secondary education programs. 
About 90 percent of all of the spending on our elementary and secondary 
schools is State and local spending, and about 10 percent is Federal 
spending. This is 41 percent of that 10 percent.
  It includes all of the money the Federal Government spends on 
elementary and secondary education except money for children with 
disabilities--and Senator Scott's legislation addresses that. It does 
not touch the Student School Lunch Program. It does not affect Federal 
research in education, and it does not affect Impact Aid.
  The whole purpose of Federal aid to elementary and secondary 
education is to help low-income students. But unfortunately, often the 
Federal dollars are diverted to schools with wealthier students. The 
left and the right both have noticed this and would like to change it.
  Scholarships for Kids would benefit only children that fit the 
Federal definition of ``poverty'' which is about one-fifth of all 
school children. That is because it would pin the $2,100 scholarship to 
the blouse or the shirt of the child, and it would follow that child to 
the school the child attends.
  Allowing Federal dollars to follow students to a school has been a 
successful strategy in American education for more than 70 years. Last 
year, $33 billion in Federal Pell Grants and $106 billion in Federal 
loans followed students to the public and private colleges of their 
choice. Since the GI bill began in 1944, these vouchers--that is what 
they are--have helped to create a marketplace of about 6,000 autonomous 
institutions and a higher education system that is regarded by almost 
everyone as the best in the world.
  Our elementary and secondary education system is not the best in the 
world. U.S. 15-year-olds rank 28th in science and 36th in math. I 
believe one reason for this is that more than 93 percent of the dollars 
that we spend through the Federal Government for higher education 
follows students to the colleges of their choice, but Federal dollars 
do not automatically follow students to the elementary or secondary 
school of their choice.
  Instead, with our elementary schools and our middle schools and our 
high schools, money is sent directly to the schools. Local government 
monopolies run most of those schools. They tell most students exactly 
which school to attend. There is little choice and no K-through-12 
marketplace as there is in higher education. Again, in higher 
education, you have 6,000 autonomous institutions. You have generous 
amounts of Federal dollars. They can follow you to the college or 
university of your choice, whether it is public or private or nonprofit 
or for-profit, as long as it is accredited. So students may go to 
Harvard, Yeshiva or Notre Dame, or to Nashville's Auto Diesel College 
or to the University of Tennessee or to the community college nearby. 
The former Librarian of Congress, Daniel Boorstin, often wrote that 
American creativity has flourished during ``fertile verges,'' times 
when Americans became more self-aware and creative.
  In his book, ``Breakout,'' Newt Gingrich argues that society is on 
the edge of such an era, the Internet age, an age where everything will 
change, like everything changed at the time of the new internal 
combustion engine.
  Newt Gingrich in his book cites computer handbook writer Tim O'Reilly 
for his suggestion about how the Internet could transform government. 
Here is how Tim O'Reilly says we ought to do our job as we try to help 
use the government to help Americans during this period of time:

       The best way for government to operate is to figure out 
     what kinds of things are enablers of society and make 
     investments in those things. The same way that Apple figured 
     out, ``If we turn the IPhone into a platform, outside 
     developers will bring hundreds of thousands of 
     applications to the table.''

  Already 16 States have begun a variety of innovative programs 
supporting private school choice. Private organizations in many parts 
of our country supplement these efforts. Scholarships For Kids, 
allowing $2,100 Federal scholarships to follow 11 million children, 
would enable other school choice innovations in the same way that 
developers rushed to provide applications for the iPhone platform.
  Senator Tim Scott has proposed what he calls the CHOICE Act. It would 
allow 11 billion other Federal dollars that the Federal Government now 
spends through programs for children with disabilities to follow these 
6 million children to the schools their parents believe provide the 
best services.
  So there might be a child in Tennessee or Wisconsin or South Carolina 
who is eligible for both--the Scholarship For Kids, because he or she 
comes from a family that fits the Federal poverty definition. So there 
is $2,100. Then, if that child is also disabled, the child might be 
eligible for a scholarship under the CHOICE Act of several thousand 
dollars. That would then be in addition to the amount of money that 
South Carolina, let's say, spends on education per child, which is in 
the neighborhood of $9,000.
  So to take the case of Tennessee again, $8,000 or so for the State, 
$2,100 more Federal dollars through Scholarship For Kids, a few more 
thousand dollars, depending upon circumstances, for the scholarship 
under Senator Scott's proposal, and you have a significant amount of 
money that a parent could use to follow a child to the school that 
helps that child succeed.
  Especially in the case of children with disabilities, that seems to 
make so much good sense to me. Senator Scott tells a poignant story of 
a young girl in South Carolina who was in a kindergarten. She has Down 
syndrome. She was in a kindergarten that helped her succeed. But then 
her parents moved. They had to fight for a year to get her new school 
to treat her in a mainstream way. Then they realized that the school 
they had been fighting for a year was the one they were counting on.
  Why not let that family take the $13,000, $14,000, $15,000 or $16,000 
for that child with Down syndrome, pick a school that treasures that 
child, and let the money follow the child to the school the child 
attends.
  So a student with a disability and from a low-income family would 
benefit under both programs. As I said when I began my remarks, taken 
together with Senator Scott's proposal, Scholarship For Kids 
constitutes the most ambitious proposal ever to use existing Federal 
dollars to enable States to expand school choice.
  Importantly, this is not a Federal mandate. Washington is full of 
politicians who fly an hour or an hour and a half from their home town, 
and they

[[Page S507]]

get here and think they have suddenly gotten smarter. They have a good 
idea and they say: Oh, let's apply that in Wisconsin and in Tennessee 
and in South Carolina. I try not to do that. I am a very strong 
believer, for example, in teacher evaluations. I led the fight for 
teacher evaluations as Governor of Tennessee 30 years ago. We were the 
first State to do it. When I came to Washington people said: Well then, 
you will want to make everybody do that? My answer was no, I will not. 
States have the opportunity to be right, and they have the opportunity 
to be wrong.
  The last thing Tennessee needs is the Federal Government peering over 
the shoulders of communities and school districts and legislators and 
governors and school boards who are trying to work out the very 
difficult problem of teacher evaluations. It is the holy grail of 
education reform as far as I am concerned, but it should not be 
mandated from Washington. I very much believe in school choice, but it 
should not be mandated from Washington. So under Scholarships For Kids, 
States still would govern pupil assignments, deciding, for example, 
whether parents could choose private schools.
  When I was Secretary of Education years ago, Milwaukee was in the 
midst of a major program to try to give low-income parents more choice 
of schools, including private schools. So along with President George 
H. W. Bush, we proposed what we called a GI bill for kids to allow 
Milwaukee and Wisconsin to do it if it wished to do it. But it did not 
impose what we thought was a good idea from Washington. Under 
Scholarship For Kids, schools that parents chose for their child with 
their $2,100 scholarship would have to be accredited. Federal civil 
rights rules would apply. My proposal does not affect school lunches. 
There also is an independent evaluation after 5 years so that Congress 
can assess the effectiveness of the new tool for innovation.
  In remarks that Senator Scott and I made this morning, the issue of 
private schools came up, which always does when we talk about expanding 
school choice. But in this case, we are not necessarily talking about 
private schools. Most schools are public schools. I would assume that 
most of these $2,100 scholarships would follow students to the school 
they attend, which would be a public school.
  So if a State chose to create a program whereby its low-income 
citizens could choose a private school, as long as it was accredited, 
that would be appropriate under the law. Why shouldn't a low-income 
family have the same opportunities for a better school for its child 
that a wealthier family, who may move to a different part of town or 
may be able to afford a private school, does?
  The idea of allowing dollars to follow students to the school of 
their choice has not exclusively been an idea of the left or of the 
right in our country. In the late 1960s, the most conspicuous proposal 
for school choice was from Ted Sizer, then Harvard University's 
education dean. He suggested a $5,000 scholarship in his poor 
children's bill of rights. That $5,000 scholarship would be worth two 
or three times as much today.
  In 1992, when I was the U.S. Secretary of Education, President George 
H. W. Bush proposed a GI bill for kids, a $\1/2\ billion Federal pilot 
program for States creating school choice opportunities. Yet despite 
its success in higher education, and despite the fact that it has had 
powerful advocates on both the left and the right, the word ``voucher'' 
remains a bad word among most of the kindergarten-through-12th-grade 
education establishment, and the idea has not spread widely. Equal 
opportunity in America should mean that everyone, as much as possible, 
has the same starting line.
  During this week celebrating school choice, there would be no better 
way to help children move up from the back of the line than by allowing 
States to use Federal dollars to create 11 million opportunities to 
choose a better school.


                          State of the Nation

  If I may conclude with a word about the context in which we find 
ourselves today, Senator Scott and I made our remarks today at American 
Enterprise Institute. I am speaking on the floor of the Senate on a 
very important day in our country's history. It is not only National 
School Choice Week, but it is the day the President of the United 
States makes his annual state of the Union address. Every President has 
done that except two--as the Senate historian told us today--and those 
two died before it was time to make the address, so it is a tradition 
that goes back to the beginning of the country. We will all go over to 
the House of Representatives, listen carefully, and the country will 
watch to listen to what the President has to say.
  We are told the issue the President will address is the one of income 
inequality. If that is what he does, that is certainly an appropriate 
issue for any American President. Because if equal opportunity is 
central to the American character, so is the idea of the American 
dream, the idea that anything is possible, that anyone can go from the 
back to the front of the line with hard work; and equal opportunity, 
therefore, helps to create a starting line from which we move.
  If the President makes that proposal, I think we know the kind of 
agenda we are likely to hear. It will have to do with a higher minimum 
wage that would actually cost jobs. It will have to do with more 
compensation for perpetual unemployment. It will have to do with 
canceling more health insurance policies, which is what ObamaCare will 
be doing in 2014--much more so than it did in 2013.
  There is another agenda, another picture, another vision of how we 
can help the largest number of Americans realize the American dream; 
that is, more jobs, more job training, and more choices for low-income 
parents of better schools for their children so they can get a better 
job.
  Instead of a higher minimum wage, which actually reduces the number 
of jobs, we would liberate the free enterprise system of the wet 
blanket of ObamaCare, other Obama rules and regulations, and create 
many more jobs with good wages. Instead of more compensation for long-
term unemployment, we would say let's have more job training so they 
can take one of these good new jobs we propose to create.
  Then, instead of directing the money to a model that hasn't worked as 
well over the last 70 years, let us take the Federal dollars we are now 
spending on elementary and secondary education and let them follow low-
income children and disabled children to the schools of their parents' 
choice, So they have an opportunity to go to a better school, just as 
children who aren't disabled and with parents who have more money do.
  We will be arguing that a better agenda for income equality to 
realize the American dream, to help Americans move from the back to the 
front of the line, is more jobs, more job opportunities, and more 
choices of better schools for low-income children. That agenda is 
especially right for the age we are in.
  I mentioned the discussion Daniel Boorstin had about America's 
fertile verges, Newt Gingrich's new book, and the suggestion by the 
computer programmer that the best way for government to operate is not 
with Washington mandates or Washington programs but to spend money on 
things that enable each of us as Americans to do things for ourselves--
to live a happier life, to live a better life, to live a wealthier 
life, to live a safer life.
  I hope in the remarks I have made today that I have done that, 
because we have 70 years of experience with such programs in education. 
I would argue there may be no more successful social program in 
American history than the GI bill for veterans. It began 70 years ago 
in 1944. It did not send money to the University of Chicago, Tennessee, 
Michigan, and Harvard. It followed the soldier, the airman, and the 
Navy veteran to the college of his or her choice. We began that 
practice in 1944. We continue it with the Pell grants today. We 
continue it with the student loans today. Why should we not follow it 
with the Federal dollars we spend for elementary and secondary 
education?
  If Federal dollars following students to the colleges of their choice 
helped to produce the finest higher education system in the world, why 
should we not allow States to try to create the best schools in the 
world for our children--especially our low-income children?
  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will recognize this 
isn't the proposal of the left or the right. I don't know many 
Democrats who want to get

[[Page S508]]

rid of Pell grants or student loans. They are vouchers, pure and 
simple, that have lasted for 70 years and may be the most successful 
social program we have. Why not allow States in this Internet age to 
take the Federal dollars we are already spending for low-income 
children and make sure the money gets directly to them--and for 
disabled children, and make sure it goes to directly to them--and give 
their parents an opportunity to exercise the same kinds of decisions 
wealthier parents do? They would say: What school would be the best 
school for my child.
  Would that not be a way to help a young American get a leg up on 
moving to the same starting line that children from wealthier families 
have--and maybe even a chance to move to the head of the line?
  I hope my colleagues and American people will take a good look at the 
Scholarships for Kids Act, and Senator Scott's CHOICE Act. Together 
they constitute the most ambitious proposal ever to use existing 
Federal dollars to enable States, and to allow parents--especially low-
income parents--to choose a better school for their child. There is no 
better way to create opportunity in America.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

11 Million $2,100 ``Scholarships for Kids"": A Real Answer to Inequality

       Today I am introducing legislation that would allow $2,100 
     federal scholarships to follow 11 million low-income children 
     to any public or private accredited school of their parents' 
     choice.
       This is a real answer to inequality in America: giving more 
     children more opportunity to attend a better school.
       The ``Scholarships for Kids Act'' will cost $24 billion a 
     year--paid for by redirecting 41 percent of the dollars now 
     directly spent on federal K-12 education programs. Often 
     these dollars are diverted to wealthier schools. 
     ``Scholarships for Kids'' would benefit only children of 
     families that fit the federal definition of poverty, which is 
     about one-fifth of all school children.
       Allowing federal dollars to follow students has been a 
     successful strategy in American education for 70 years. Last 
     year, $33 billion in federal Pell grants and $106 billion in 
     loans followed students to public and private colleges. Since 
     the GI Bill began in 1944, these vouchers have helped create 
     a marketplace of 6,000 autonomous higher education 
     institutions--the best in the world.
       Our elementary and secondary education system is not the 
     best in the world. U.S. 15-year olds rank 28th in science and 
     36th in math. I believe one reason for this is that while 
     more than 93 percent of federal dollars spent for higher 
     education follow students to colleges of their choice, 
     federal dollars do not automatically follow K-12 students to 
     schools of their choice.
       Instead, money is sent directly to schools. Local 
     government monopolies run most schools and tell most students 
     which school to attend. There is little choice and no K-12 
     marketplace as there is in higher education.
       Former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin often wrote 
     that American creativity has flourished during ``fertile 
     verges,'' times when citizens became more self-aware and 
     creative. In his book Breakout, Newt Gingrich argues that 
     society is on the edge of such an era and cites computer 
     handbook writer Tim O'Reilly's suggestion for how the 
     Internet could transform government.
       ``The best way for government to operate,'' O'Reilly says,

     that Apple figured out, `If we turn the iPhone into a

     of applications to the table.' ''
       Already 16 states have begun a variety of innovative 
     programs supporting private school choice. Private 
     organizations supplement these efforts. Allowing $2,100 
     federal scholarships to follow 11 million children would 
     enable other school choice innovations, in the same way that 
     developers rushed to provide applications for the iPhone 
     platform.
       Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) has proposed the CHOICE Act, 
     allowing 11 billion other dollars the federal government now 
     spends through the program for children with disabilities to 
     follow those 6 million children to the schools their parents 
     believe provide the best services.
       A student who is both low income and has a disability would 
     benefit under both programs. Especially when taken together 
     with Sen. Scott's proposal, ``Scholarships for Kids'' 
     constitutes the most ambitious proposal ever to use existing 
     federal dollars to enable states to expand school choice.
       Under ``Scholarships for Kids,'' states still would govern 
     pupil assignment, deciding, for example, whether parents 
     could choose private schools. Schools chosen would have to be 
     accredited. Federal civil rights rules would apply. The 
     proposal does not affect school lunches. So that Congress can 
     assess the effectiveness of this new tool for innovation, 
     there is an independent evaluation after five years.
       In the late 1960s, Ted Sizer, then Harvard University's 
     education dean, suggested a $5,000 scholarship in his ``Poor 
     Children's Bill of Rights.'' In 1992, when I was U.S. 
     education secretary, President George H.W. Bush proposed a 
     ``GI Bill for Kids,'' a half-billion-federal-dollar pilot 
     program for states creating school choice opportunities. Yet, 
     despite its success in higher education, voucher remains a 
     bad word among most of the K-12 educational establishment and 
     the idea has not spread widely.
       Equal opportunity in America should mean that everyone has 
     the same starting line. During this week celebrating school 
     choice, there would be no better way to help children move up 
     from the back of the line than by allowing states to use 
     federal dollars to create 11 million new opportunities to 
     choose a better school.

  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.


                           Health Care Reform

  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, it has been 1,406 days since the 
President signed into law the Affordable Care Act. Since that time, 
about 10 million Americans who have not had access to affordable 
insurance have gotten it and patients have been reempowered, along with 
their doctors, to take control of their own health care, taking power 
away from the insurance company which had run our medical lives for too 
long.
  The Presiding Officer and I lived through dozens of votes in the 
House of Representatives to repeal the bill, as the Senate saw as well, 
but absolutely no genuine effort to replace the health care bill. I was 
sitting in the Chair yesterday when one of our colleagues, Senator 
Hatch, came to the floor to talk about a new proposal--I would probably 
argue the first proposal from Republicans in 1,406 days to actually 
talk about what their vision--what Republicans' vision--for health care 
reform would be. This is just a framework, not a bill, that has been 
suggested by our colleagues, Senator Hatch and Senator Coburn and 
Senator Burr. So I wanted to come to the floor to talk about the 
implications of this framework for affordability and patient 
protections all across this country.
  First of all, I give some credit to our colleagues because it has 
been 1,406 days of complaints, of politics, of obfuscation, of 
obstruction. So for the first time we are at least beginning to see 
what the Republican vision is for the future of health care in this 
country. Although we don't have a bill--all we have at this point is a 
framework--it is a pretty scary future because the proposal from our 
Republican colleagues would dramatically increase the cost of health 
care for millions of Americans and would put the insurance companies 
back in charge of our health care.
  So for a few minutes I wish to talk in real terms about what this 
proposal will actually do for health care in this country. I only have 
a few minutes, so it is hard to go through the litany of backward steps 
we would take were we to adopt the proposal that has been laid out by a 
couple of our very brave Republican colleagues.
  But the first thing it would do is it would reinstate the fact that 
being a woman for decades in this country was considered to be a 
preexisting condition. The health care reform bill says very simply 
there can be no difference in the amount of money one pays for health 
care based on gender. The facts are plain: Women have historically paid 
50 percent more in terms of health care costs than men have across this 
country; $1 billion more is the total amount of money women have paid 
more than men simply because insurance companies believe that being a 
woman is a preexisting condition. That is no longer the law of the 
land. Women pay the same rate as men. There is no difference based on 
gender. But that would be eliminated by this plan. Once again, being a 
woman could be considered a preexisting condition.
  Second, annual limits on the ability to recoup the cost of your 
health care from your insurance company would be reimposed. The health 
care bill says: Listen. It isn't fair that you buy an insurance policy, 
and when you get very sick, you are told at some point midway through 
the year your insurance is up. That is not real insurance. The idea of 
insurance is that we all pool our risks together, and then if one of 
us, through no fault of our own, gets sick, we actually get those 
insurance bills paid.

[[Page S509]]

  The Affordable Care Act says there can't be any more of those annual 
limits, but the proposal from our Republican friends says that annual 
limits can come back from insurance companies. To someone such as Debra 
Gauvin from Connecticut, who had a $20,000 limit and who was diagnosed 
with stage II breast cancer and hit her limit about halfway through the 
year and then incurred about $18,000 of additional costs, causing her 
to basically forgo treatment, that was a painful reality of an 
insurance plan not delivering on insurance simply because she got so 
sick she had big costs. That would once again be the reality. The 
Republican plan would once again allow for annual limits.
  Our friends talk about the fact that they address the issue of 
preexisting conditions, but they don't. They truly don't. Because all 
their plan says is that if you switch plans and you have no gap, the 
new plan has to cover whatever illness you may have. But that is not 
how life works. There are 89 million Americans, in an average year, who 
have at least a 1-month gap in coverage. That 1-month gap in coverage 
under the Republican plan--the one shown to us in a basic framework--
would allow for preexisting condition discrimination to once again be 
the law.
  Betty Berger, one of my constituents, had insurance her entire life 
except for basically about a 1- or 2-month period of time where her 
husband was switching jobs. During that time, their son was diagnosed 
with cancer. The new insurance company at her husband's new employer 
wouldn't cover the preexisting condition, and the Bergers lost 
everything. They lost their home, they lost their savings, and their 
lives were financially ruined.
  The Affordable Care Act ends that nightmare for families. Fifty 
percent of bankruptcies in this country are caused by medical debt. The 
Republican plan does not fix the preexisting condition discrimination. 
All it says is, if you don't have any change, any gap in your coverage, 
then the new insurance company has to cover your preexisting condition. 
But for millions of families that is not how life works.
  Lastly, although the Republican plan does acknowledge the basic 
underlying wisdom of the Affordable Care Act is right, in that the best 
way to get coverage to people is to give them a tax credit with which 
to go buy private insurance--that is the foundation of the Affordable 
Care Act, and the Republican alternative that our colleagues introduced 
basically adopts that as their framework for expanding coverage as 
well--it is at a much lesser subsidy rate, with much greater tax 
consequences to Americans than the Affordable Care Act has in it.
  For instance, the Republican alternative says, if you hit 300 percent 
of the poverty level, that is it, no more subsidy. Well, 300 percent 
sounds like a lot. Three hundred is a big number. But the poverty level 
is pretty measly in this country. If someone is making 300 percent of 
the poverty level, they are making $34,000 a year. I don't know about 
the State of the Presiding Officer, but in Connecticut it is hard to 
put food on the table on a consistent basis at $34,000 a year. Then to 
have no help from the government to buy insurance essentially means we 
will have a huge class of people making $30,000 to $40,000 a year who 
under the Affordable Care Act are getting helped by insurance but whom 
under this alternative plan will get no help.
  But here is how it is even worse. The Republican alternative we have 
seen this framework on says that one of the ways we are going to pay 
for this is by taxing people for the health care they are 
getting. Right now, if someone gets health care coverage thro.."

[Pages S3437-S3438]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the great Albert Einstein defined insanity 
as follows: ``doing the same thing over and over again and expecting 
different results.'' That is what Albert Einstein said. If his 
definition is true--and I am not going to argue with Einstein--the 
House Republicans have truly lost their minds. This week the House of 
Representatives will vote for the 37th time--the 37th time--on exactly 
the same thing. What are they voting on? They are voting to repeal the 
landmark constitutional health care reform bill known now as 
ObamaCare--and I say that proudly.
  After last year's election, Speaker Boehner conceded that ObamaCare 
is here to stay. Here is what he said:

       It's pretty clear that the president was re-elected. 
     Obamacare is the law of the land.

  I think that is a pretty fair statement. Again, the Speaker said it 
is pretty clear President Obama was reelected and ObamaCare is the law 
of the land. So no matter what he said then, this is now, and he has 
changed his mind. The House will waste yet another week on another 
dead-end repeal vote. Perhaps Republicans think the 37th time is the 
charm, but 37 times on the exact same thing?

[[Page S3438]]

  Tea party extremists bullied the Speaker into holding yet another 
vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and roll back benefits for tens 
of millions of Americans.
  This is what the Speaker said last week:

       We've got 70 new Members who have not had an opportunity to 
     vote on the President's health care law. . . . Frankly, 
     they've been asking for an opportunity to vote on it.

  This political kabuki has tied up the floor of the House of 
Representatives for weeks and cost the American taxpayers $52.4 million 
and counting. These are figures compiled by CBS News of the time wasted 
on those 37 votes--all the House staff and all other personnel who have 
responsibilities for making sure that place runs as well as it does. 
That money--$52.4 million--is enough to restore funding for 19 million 
meals for homebound seniors or 6,900 children dropped from the Head 
Start Program.
  But while the vote may be political theater, it does have one 
benefit: The American people will know where the freshman class of 
House Republicans stands. I think we know, but we will get another 
opportunity to see this. Do they stand with millions of Americans who 
are already benefiting from ObamaCare--we know that answer--or do they 
stand with insurance companies? We know that answer.
  The insurance companies would like nothing better than to have things 
the way they used to be and to once again deny coverage to sick 
children, impose lifetime caps on care, and discriminate against those 
with preexisting conditions. Since President Obama signed the 
Affordable Care Act into law, insurance companies can no longer put 
profits ahead of people.
  One of the provisions in this bill says that, of premiums paid to 
insurance companies for health care, 80 percent of those premiums must 
go to patients. No longer, as once happened, will 50 percent of the 
premiums go for salaries and bonuses and other perks for insurance 
executives--no longer. Insurance companies can no longer discriminate 
against children with preexisting conditions. They can no longer raise 
rates for no reason. They can no longer drop coverage if someone gets 
sick. But that is what happened. Yet this week, for the 37th time, 
House Republicans will try to change all that.
  Here are a few of the other benefits already in effect that House 
Republicans would eliminate. In Nevada alone--and we are not a heavily 
populated State such as Massachusetts or California or New York, but we 
are getting bigger, we have about 3 million people--tens of thousands 
of seniors have saved tens of millions of dollars on medicines because 
the Affordable Care Act closed the gap on prescription drugs. That 
means millions of seniors across this country have more money in their 
pockets for food, gas, and electric bills.
  More than 3 million young people, because of ObamaCare, including 
33,000 young Nevadans, have benefited from a provision in the law that 
allows children to stay on their parents' health plans until they are 
26 years old. That means no person will have to worry about getting 
sick while looking for a job that offers insurance or while they go to 
college.
  In my little town of Searchlight, NV, a boy made a decision. Was he 
going to join the military--he was from a patriotic family--or was he 
going to go to college? He made the decision that he was going to go to 
college. His family was not one of means. His mom worked part time in a 
post office, and his dad worked at a powerplant about 40 miles from 
Searchlight. They were so happy that this boy was going to go to 
college. He was the first person in their family to go to college, and 
he did extremely well.
  He finished his first year, and he was in his second year when he 
started feeling some discomfort. He had testicular cancer. At the time 
ObamaCare passed, he was 23 years old and no longer could he be on his 
parents' insurance. So they had no insurance to cover this cancer their 
son had--their youngest boy. They begged and borrowed and literally--
well, I shouldn't say ``begged.'' They didn't do that. They had a very 
difficult time of it. He needed two surgeries.
  Now I guess the Republicans in the House want to go back to that. 
Maybe the Republicans here--they love voting against ObamaCare 
provisions--want to go back to a time when that boy, Jeff, would no 
longer have insurance. That is what they want for these young men and 
women who are trying to go to college, to get a job--they want to go 
back to that time. He has 3 extra years now. That means a lot.
  Under ObamaCare, hundreds of thousands of businesses that already 
offer their employees health insurance are getting tax credits for 
doing the right thing. That means small business owners can spend their 
capital on growing their firms instead of growing insurance premiums.
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer 
set arbitrary lifetime caps on benefits, as they once did. What does 
that mean? It means there was a provision hidden in that policy they 
sold you that stated that when your benefits reach $50,000, coverage 
stops. It didn't matter if you had been hurt in an automobile accident 
or you had cancer or some other dread disease; it used to stop. Not 
anymore. Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans are 
no longer one car accident or a heart attack away from bankruptcy.
  Today, children can no longer be denied coverage because they are 
born with a disease or a disability--a protection that will soon be 
extended to all Americans. Soon, being a woman will no longer be a 
preexisting condition. I said that right, Mr. President. No longer will 
being a woman be a preexisting condition. My daughter has a preexisting 
condition. What is it? She is a woman. But no longer. In a few months, 
129 million Americans with preexisting conditions, such as high blood 
pressure or epilepsy, can rest assured they will have access to 
affordable insurance and lifesaving care regardless of how much money 
they make or don't make. And soon 25 million more Americans who can't 
afford health insurance will have access to reasonably priced insurance 
and quality care. But if Republicans get their way, these benefits and 
more will disappear. There is going to be a vote in the House of 
Representatives to repeal everything I have talked about--not change it 
but repeal it.
  President Obama led the charge here, and we were able to pass the 
Affordable Care Act--the most significant change in our health care 
delivery system since Medicare all those many, many years ago. It 
ensures access to quality affordable health care for every American. 
But Republicans would erase these gains and force millions of American 
families to once again rely on expensive emergency room care or go 
without care at all.
  Fortunately, the Republicans' latest exercise in insanity, as 
described by Albert Einstein--that is, their latest repeal effort--is 
doomed to fail just as it did the previous 36 times.

[Pages S1885-S1887]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. DURBIN. I listened carefully to the statement just made by the 
Republican leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, in which he promised 
concrete ideas, real hope, change, job-related approaches, free 
enterprise--giving free enterprise a chance, trying to deal with 
putting America back to work. Then he gave us three examples.
  I might say to the Senator that I am familiar with all three because 
none of these are new. We have heard them over and over from the 
Republican side of the aisle. I will not go through each one of them. A 
couple of them relate to the Affordable Care Act. It is interesting to 
me that the House of Representatives has voted--I believe 45 times--to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act. The Senator from Kentucky said we have 
to get back to free enterprise ideas.
  Let me tell you about the free enterprise idea when it came to health 
care. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the free 
enterprise idea was this: If you and your family were unfortunate 
enough to have a sick baby, if your wife was a cancer survivor, if your 
child had diabetes, the free enterprise answer was: We will raise the 
cost of health insurance to the point that you cannot afford it or we 
won't even offer it. That was the free enterprise idea on health 
insurance for millions of American families.
  There was another free enterprise idea out there in health care as 
well. It said: We are going to sell you health insurance policies that 
just protect you up to a certain amount of money. If tomorrow you are 
in a terrible auto accident, if the day after tomorrow you are 
diagnosed with cancer and face millions of dollars of radiation, 
surgery, and care before you can get your life back together again, be 
my guest to pay for it yourselves. That is why medical bills are the 
number one driver of bankruptcy in America today. That is free 
enterprise at work. But we said, let's put some sensible rules for the 
road in here, so that families who buy health insurance have the 
promise that they will have peace of mind when they face these life 
threatening struggles which families face every day.
  So we passed the Affordable Care Act and not a single Republican--not 
one--not a single Republican would join us in that effort. We rejected 
the free enterprise approach to health care and said let's have 
something that basically respects families, basically respects the 
needs we all have to have protection when somebody in the house is 
sick. Not a single Republican would support us, and they never have 
since.
  The bill we passed isn't perfect. Changes will have to be made. I 
have said that from the start, although I supported it. But not a 
single Republican has been willing to sit down and work on bipartisan 
compromises and changes--not one. It is take it or leave it, and they 
want to walk away from it.
  We are not going back to those old days. I can guarantee them that 
the American people will never return to their idea of health insurance 
because it was fundamentally unfair, it was too expensive, and a lot of 
Americans didn't have a fighting chance to ever have health insurance 
once in their lives. Things have changed. The reports are in, and the 
reports are telling us that dramatic things are occurring. As the 
Affordable Care Act's initial enrollment period closes, at least 9.5 
million previously uninsured people have gained coverage. Some have 
done so through the marketplaces created by law, some through private 
insurance, others through an expanded Medicaid. Incidentally, Medicaid 
has been expanded in about half of the States.
  Listen to this: The increased coverage from the Affordable Care Act 
so far amounts to substantial progress toward one of the law's 
principal goals. It is the most significant expansion of health care 
coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid 49 years ago.
  The Republicans want to return to the ``good old days,'' and they 
want to tell these people being uninsured is really better for you. It 
is the free enterprise system.
  That is not good enough, I say to my friends on the other side of the 
aisle. What we have here is an opportunity for families for the first 
time in their lives to have health insurance coverage.
  Has there ever been a moment in your life where you had a sick baby 
and you were in the hospital waiting room and you had no health 
insurance? I have. It happened when I was in law school. I remember it 
to this day, sitting there with my wife and baby with a number in my 
hand waiting to see who would walk through that door and be the doctor 
for my baby. You will never forget that as long as you live. That 
shouldn't happen to anybody. Everyone should have the peace of mind of 
health insurance coverage, and that is what this bill does. If the 
Senators on the other side want to return to the

[[Page S1886]]

``good old days'' of no coverage, I can just tell you, America is not 
going back.

  We are not going back to the days when families with kids graduating 
from college had no health insurance while they looked for a job. We 
protect those families until the kids reach the age of 26. We are not 
going back to the days when struggling senior citizens can't afford to 
pay for their prescription drugs because of the so-called doughnut 
hole. We are not going back to that day. We are going to move forward 
as a Nation.
  Is this bill perfect? Of course not. Should it be changed for the 
better? Yes. But let's not lose sight of what we have achieved and what 
we can achieve if we work together.


                            The Minimum Wage

  When it comes to the creation of jobs, there is something else I want 
to say. I believe that people who get up and go to work every single 
day, who work hard for a living and are not lazy at all, should not be 
living in poverty. That is it--a basic statement. If you want to go to 
work, work hard 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty in 
America, and that is happening because the minimum wage is $7.25 an 
hour. Do the math. It is less than $16,000 a year to live on. Who could 
do it? Well, some people try and struggle paycheck to paycheck.
  Yesterday in Chicago, IL, Gloria came to the microphone in the 
Federal Plaza and told the story of working a minimum-wage job. She has 
two kids and lives in a homeless shelter--40 hours a week on minimum 
wage and living in a homeless shelter. Come on. This is a better 
Nation.
  Would I pay 10 cents more for a hamburger so Gloria would have enough 
money to have the dignity to live in her own place with her children? 
You bet I would, and I wouldn't think twice about it. We ought to have 
respect for people who work in this country. Raising the minimum wage 
to $10.10 an hour is our show of respect for the people who get up and 
go to work every darn day. They are on the buses of New Jersey in the 
morning. They are on the trains of Chicago in the morning. They just 
dropped the kids off, and they are hoping that they are going to be 
safe because it is a neighbor and it is the best they can do for 
daycare. There wasn't a lot in the refrigerator when they left their 
house. They are hoping to pick up something before they get home. They 
go to work every day, and they know that struggle is going to be 
repeated over and over.
  The free enterprise system is the best system in the world, but there 
are moments when we need to step in as the American family and set some 
standards, set some goals.


                   Unemployment Compensation Benefits

  The same thing is true for unemployment compensation. We finally have 
a bipartisan approach to this in the Senate--five Democrats and five 
Republicans. We have worked out a plan we are going to pass, I think--
let's keep our fingers crossed. We are going to pass an extension of 
unemployment benefits.
  What do these benefits mean? It means if you are out of work--some 
people who work for 20 years in the same place, lost their jobs, now 
they are trying to find another job--we are going to help you keep your 
family together while you are looking for that job. How much money are 
we talking about here? The average is $300 a week.
  How long could you get by on $300 a week? It would be tough, wouldn't 
it, to pay the rent, mortgage, utility bills, food, clothes, shoes for 
the kids, cell phone--you need that to find a job, don't you--300 bucks 
a week. Well, we have a chance to pass a bipartisan bill on 
unemployment compensation for a 5-month period to cover these folks, 
and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John 
Boehner, says: Forget it--dead on arrival. Won't even take it up; won't 
consider it. I think he's wrong, and I think it is unfair, and I think 
these people deserve a fighting chance. They want to become part of the 
free enterprise system again, and our giving them a helping hand in 
time of need is what every family expects and what they usually offer 
when asked to help. But instead, what Speaker Boehner has said is: No 
way, you are out of it. You are out of work. You are out of luck. I 
don't buy it.
  There have been times in my life and in the lives of most people when 
neighbors, friends and relatives, and even the government came in to 
give a helping hand. For me it was government loans when I went to 
school. I couldn't have done it without it. I think it has paid off. It 
sure has in my life. Ultimately the voters have the last word about 
whether Speaker Boehner's approach against unemployment compensation is 
the right way to do it.

  There is another bill we are going to take up next week--pay equity. 
My wife and I have been blessed with a daughter and a son. They are 
both in the marketplace and both are talented. We are so proud of them. 
There is no reason why a daughter should be paid less than a son for 
the same work, but it happens every single day.
  We have to establish a standard in America of equal opportunity and 
mean it, equal opportunity when it comes to daughters and sons and 
women and men in the workplace. It is not too much to ask.
  The first bill President Obama signed into law as President was the 
Lilly Ledbetter Act. I remember this woman. She worked in Alabama in a 
tire factory. After she had been there more than 10 years, she finally 
realized she was doing the same job as the man standing next to her but 
paid less every single day. She had enough of it so she brought a 
lawsuit against the company. The Supreme Court turned her away so we 
had to change the law, and the President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act 
into law to make sure women had a fighting chance.
  We now want to move it to a new level and make sure that pay equity 
for those in the workplace is an American dream come true. We can do 
that. The free enterprise system is good, but, listen--let's be honest 
about it--in some aspects it doesn't reach the goals we want in terms 
of equal opportunity in this country.
  I also want to make a point about the whole question of affordable 
care. I happened to have met a man by the name of Ray Romanowski. He 
was in a health care clinic in Chicago. He is 62 years old and has been 
a part-time worker and musician most of his life. For the first time in 
his life Ray Romanowski has health insurance. He has a Medicaid card. 
He was patting his wallet, and he said: I can't tell you how good I 
feel now that I finally got this health insurance.
  There are some people who don't understand Medicaid. Medicaid is 
health insurance for low-income people in America, and millions depend 
on it every single day. Recently some Republicans made statements 
discrediting the Medicaid Program. Let me set the record straight: 
Medicaid is successful. It has been a lifeline for millions of people, 
and especially for children. My friends on the other side of the aisle 
find it easy to discredit a government program. As Senator McConnell 
said earlier, we tend to look to the government. Well, we do when there 
is no place else to look. In this case, these individuals had no chance 
for health insurance without government's help. Over 54 million people 
benefit from Medicaid, and it is not surprising that interest in this 
program grows when our economy is struggling.
  Before the Affordable Care Act, two out of three people on Medicaid 
were pregnant women and children--36 million of our most vulnerable 
citizens. Medicaid also serves the disabled. It has been a lifeline for 
those who have a low income and are disabled. Before the Affordable 
Care Act, almost 3 million people were covered by Medicaid in Illinois 
and over 50 percent of all births were covered by Medicaid. Since the 
Affordable Care Act was signed into law, over 210,000 people in 
Illinois have signed up for Medicaid, and thousands more who are 
eligible are in the process of finishing up their paperwork, and that 
is a success.
  According to 2011 data, 65 percent of all office space physicians in 
Illinois would take Medicaid patients. Nationwide the number is 70 
percent. This argument that new Medicaid patients won't have a place to 
go for care is wrong.
  I see that Senator Harkin from Iowa, chairman of our HELP Committee, 
is on the floor. He was one of the real leaders when it came to the 
determination of the Affordable Care Act and how many people would be 
covered. I will yield the floor to him in 1 minute, but before I yield, 
let me say this: The Affordable Care Act is making a difference. For 
people in the low-income

[[Page S1887]]

category, Medicaid means when they walk into a hospital facing a 
medical emergency or need for care, they will not walk away leaving 
bills behind them. Their bills will be paid by the Medicaid system, and 
that is part of what we are trying to achieve--the personal 
responsibility that every person, every family, and every business will 
have a responsibility to have health insurance and an opportunity for 
an affordable alternative.
  The free enterprise system is a strong system. The free enterprise 
system created unfairness and injustice when it came to health care, 
which we are addressing with this Affordable Care Act.
  I yield the floor for Senator Harkin and thank him for his leadership 
on this issue.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.
  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank our majority whip again 
for telling it like it is and what is happening with health care in 
America today. We have come too far to turn back. We have made 
tremendous changes in the way people are going to access the health 
care system in America because of the Affordable Care Act.
  Look, we all admit there were mistakes made. Were there glitches? 
Yes. But we went from a system where people were excluded from getting 
health care, and Senator Durbin talked about them. There are various 
people with preexisting conditions, kids and people who had no access 
to health care whatsoever, and now they are covered. That is a huge 
leap in this country. We made some mistakes, had a few glitches, and we 
worked those out.
  Our friends on the other side say: No, ditch the whole thing. Get rid 
of everything. Turn the clock back. I agree with the Senator from 
Illinois, people don't want to turn the clock back. They want to move 
ahead. They are getting covered more than ever before with affordable 
coverage they have never had before and we are not going to turn the 
clock back. I thank the Senator.

              PRESIDENT PLAYING POLITICS WITH HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the President is playing 
politics with the American people's health care.
  According to an editorial published in The Wall Street Journal:

       The White House seems to regard laws as mere suggestions, 
     including the laws it helped to write. On the heels of last 
     week's 1-year suspension of the Affordable Care Act's 
     employer mandate to offer insurance to workers, the 
     administration is now waiving a new batch of its own 
     ObamaCare prescriptions. These disclosures arrived inside a 
     606-page catchall final rule that the Health and Human 
     Services Department published on Friday, July 5--a classic 
     Friday news dump, with extra credit for the holiday weekend. 
     HHS now says it will no longer attempt to verify individual 
     eligibility for insurance subsidies and instead will rely on 
     self-reporting, with minimal efforts to verify if the 
     information consumers provide is accurate.

  House Republicans have warned for years of the failure of ObamaCare--
that it is too unworkable, too overreaching, and too destructive for 
American families. House Republicans have voted 37 times to repeal or 
to defund ObamaCare. The American people deserve a health care system 
based on the doctor-patient relationship, not on one mandated by a 
government.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.

                      HEALTH CARE IS A CIVIL RIGHT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I think the real message should be that 
the President should not negotiate against the civil rights of 
Americans. Sometimes it's important for those of us who have had life 
experiences to reflect on them.
  I remember as a younger girl riding in a segregated railcar, isolated 
from others because of the color of my skin. Civil rights have 
expanded, but there are many who stood against them--the 1957 bill, the 
1964 and 1965 bills. Americans will find out that health care is a 
civil right and that this is one of the most historic and life-changing 
bills ever passed--the Affordable Care Act.
  Rather than stand in the way to defund ObamaCare, I want to stand 
with the young cancer victim who will now be able to get insurance. I 
want to stand with the young child who had leukemia and who was denied 
insurance and died. I want to stand with small businesses that will now 
be able to provide health insurance for their workers.
  I want to stand with understanding that, in fact, this bill is going 
to work. That's the fear on the other side. They are willing to defund 
the government because they don't want America to know that one of 
their civil rights--good health care--is coming and going to work.
  I ask everybody to go to HealthCare.gov because your civil rights are 
coming on October 1.

                         HEALTH CARE AND PPACA

  (Mr. SALMON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my continued 
concerns with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It seems 
that every day we learn a new way this law is negatively impacting the 
American middle class.
  Last week, three prominent unions sent a letter to the Senate 
majority leader and the House minority leader. In the letter, union 
leaders highlighted how ObamaCare is driving up the cost of small group 
insurance plans, causing employers to drop employees from their 
coverage or convert the employees to part-time status.
  In fact, that's exactly what happened in my district in Mesa, 
Arizona. The Maricopa Community College District

[[Page H4609]]

announced that it will be cutting hours for adjunct faculty and 
student-service workers in order to convert them to part-time status 
and avoid onerous ObamaCare requirements and mandates. This is not only 
a financial hardship for these professors and their families, but the 
students suffer as well.
  Higher costs under ObamaCare are forcing employers to choose between 
keeping their doors open or cutting hours and staffing levels. These 
are the unintended consequences of a very, very bad law.
  It's time to repeal this law before it inflicts more harm on middle 
class America. We must take all necessary steps to repeal and replace 
this tragic legislation with true health care reform that relies on 
commonsense free-market policies and returns the power to patients and 
their doctors, not Washington bureaucrats.

         RATE SHOCK AND THE PRESIDENT'S TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, well, here we are. The Affordable Care Act 
is going to be 3 years old in just a few days, and we're continuing to 
uncover things within the law that nobody knew about. Remember all the 
stuff that was sold to the public because it was going to be ``free''? 
But we all know nothing is free, so how do you pay for it?
  Well, it turns out there's going to be tax on insurance companies and 
taxes on employers which, guess what? That's going to be passed on to 
the employees and the beneficiaries. The deadline is quickly 
approaching and plans are submitting their bids, but they're faced with 
no choice but to raise costs.
  In response to the rate increases, the Federal Government is 
attempting to limit higher premiums by something they call rate review. 
But anytime you treat only the symptom of a disease and not the 
underlying cause, you're going to end up with something you didn't 
expect.
  Continued regulatory pressure--continued pressure on employers and 
continued pressure on insurance plans--is going to result in actually 
further increasing rates. The government is attempting to control the 
market. But we all know this market is one the government cannot 
control, and the end result is that we'll all suffer.
  Let's face it. Instead of ``if you like what you have, you can keep 
it,'' what they really meant to say was ``you're going to pay a lot 
more to get a lot less.''

         THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER BRINGS MORE CHAOS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act becomes more 
apparent every day that goes by, and the problems that are contained 
therein. Indeed, the President's takeover of health care is delivering 
more chaos to our health care system.
  We have 26 States that are not going to be participating in State 
exchanges, so a Federal exchange will be set up in those States. The 
complex eligibility process that citizens will have to go through, the 
exchange of personal information with Federal agencies that they are 
going to be required to provide, is truly staggering. Once an 
individual submits an application to an exchange, the information is 
then shared with Health and Human Services, the Social Security 
Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury 
Department, and the IRS.
  Enrollees will not only have to submit all of their information when 
they first enroll, but they will have to resubmit every year.
  The President's law intends that exchanges will be ready by October 
1. Let me tell you, the five Federal agencies that are involved in this 
are not forthcoming with the information that they're, in fact, on 
track. And, in fact, the informatics piece, the information piece that 
is supposed to be ready when this is all switched on in October is 
likely not to be ready.
  There was a better way to do this. Republicans had better ideas. 
Governors had better ideas. The administration simply would not listen.

[Pages S1212-S1223]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mrs. MURRAY. I come to the floor this afternoon to take some time to 
talk about a law this Chamber passed in 2009. I wish to talk a little 
bit about what it means to serve in this body, what our 
responsibilities are, and why our constituents sent us here in the 
first place.
  I have served in the Senate for more than 20 years and I have seen my 
share of controversial legislation. I have seen Democratic bills that 
Republicans couldn't stand; I have seen Democratic bills that Democrats 
wouldn't vote for; and I have seen bills that pretty much everybody 
opposed. But what I have seen in the last 4 years since the Affordable 
Care Act was passed by Congress and signed by the President is 
something new altogether.
  Since the day that law passed, I have seen some of my Republican 
colleagues set reason, and some of their basic duties as public 
officials, completely aside, all in opposition of a law that means 
millions of Americans have access to affordable, quality health 
insurance they couldn't get before. It is a law that means millions of 
young people, many of them fresh out of college, are able to stay on 
their families' insurance plans. It is a law that says it is illegal 
for insurance companies to charge women more money just because they 
are women. It is a law that has provided millions of Americans with 
access to free preventive screenings and health care such as 
colonoscopies, mammograms, and flu shots. It is a law that says if you 
are an American and you have a preexisting condition, it is illegal for 
an insurance company to turn you away.
  Since 2009, I have seen some of my colleagues simply refuse to 
acknowledge those facts about the law. I have watched them time and 
time again not listen to or hear stories of people in their own States 
whose lives have been changed by the Affordable Care Act and others who 
simply need access to get the benefits that are theirs. Some of my 
colleagues have even passed laws that make it harder to get covered 
under the Affordable Care Act.
  One of our responsibilities as Senators, as public servants, is to 
help our

[[Page S1213]]

constituents access the Federal benefits that are available to them, 
particularly when it comes to health care. That might mean, perhaps, 
putting someone in touch with a navigator to help make sure they are 
getting the most affordable health insurance plan. It may be helping 
them become aware of an enrollment event in their State where they can 
learn how to get covered.
  But our responsibilities don't end there. We also have to have an 
open, honest discussion about what the Affordable Care Act means for 
our constituents and talk about ways to improve it.
  Instead, what we have seen is some of our colleagues who have spent 
the better part of 4 years try to turn this law into a bogeyman and 
trying to score cheap political points on an issue that can literally 
mean the difference between life and death.
  I can understand why some of our colleagues disagree with parts of 
this law, and I have heard from some people who had challenges, 
honestly. We have to look and say can we fix this in a way that makes 
it work better for you. But what I can't understand is why anyone 
elected to Congress would decide to simply ignore real-life stories of 
their own constituents whose lives were changed the day this law took 
effect.
  I can't understand why anyone would ignore an opportunity to make 
this law better, because that is not why we were sent here. We were 
sent here to listen to our constituents and fight to make sure our laws 
work for them.
  I want to give some examples from my home State of Washington about 
people whose lives have been changed by the Affordable Care Act, people 
whose stories have been pretty much ignored in Washington, DC. I know 
later this afternoon several of my colleagues will be doing the same 
thing, so I hope everybody can turn off Fox News for a little while, 
not listen to Rush Limbaugh, and listen to some real stories of real 
live Americans who have been impacted by this law. I encourage them to 
go home and listen to some of the men and women in their own States, 
because the stories I am going to share are not unique.
  I will start with the story of Susan Wellman from Bellingham, WA. She 
is self-employed and has had to pay for individual health insurance. 
Every year she has watched her health care costs rise higher and 
higher. It reached the point where she was paying $300 monthly premiums 
with an $8,000 deductible. All were what she described as ``paying for 
nothing.'' So as soon as she could, Susan got access to health care 
through our Washington State exchange, and she was so happy to have 
that chance. She spoke on the phone with a real-live person, and she 
was able to sign up for an affordable plan in just a few minutes. Now 
Susan is on a plan that costs her $125 a month instead of $300--$125 
instead of $300--and it is a plan that has a $2,000 deductible, not an 
$8,000 deductible, and she says it actually pays for things.

  Guess what. She can now afford to go to a doctor not just in the case 
of an emergency but for a physical or a mammogram that could save her 
life, not to mention thousands of dollars in health care costs. That 
kind of preventive care is good for Susan, and it is good for her 
family. It is also good for this country because when more people have 
access to preventive care, it makes health care cheaper for every 
single one of us.
  Another person I have heard from whose life was changed by the 
affordable health care act is a man named Don Davis. He is 59 years 
old, and he actually goes by ``Reverend Don.'' He is a pastor in 
Seattle, and he is also a volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club. As the 
pastor of his church, he doesn't get any health care through his job. 
He doesn't even have a salary. That meant for a long time that Reverend 
Don didn't have health insurance. So when he was hospitalized back in 
2008 for severe headaches, he was only able to receive an MRI through 
charity care. That MRI showed that Reverend Don had several brain 
tumors, but when the doctors wanted to do more testing and provide more 
care, he didn't have the insurance to pay for that. This is a man who 
has asked for nothing in life, who woke up every day willing to give to 
others, but he couldn't get the basic care he needed when he got sick.
  Reverend Don is healthy today. He is serving his community. Because 
of the Affordable Care Act, he now also has health insurance. He signed 
up with a navigator at the local YWCA. Now, if he gets a headache, he 
can afford to go to the doctor. So because of the Affordable Care Act, 
Reverend Don can afford to dedicate his life to people in his community 
and he doesn't need to worry that the cost of the health care he needs 
might be denied him.
  Finally, I want to talk about a couple in Bellingham, WA, named Rod 
Burton and Sarah Hill. Rod is one of millions of Americans who have had 
the utterly maddening experience of being denied insurance because of a 
preexisting condition. In Rod's case his preexisting condition was a 
congenital heart defect. Under our old system Rod was deemed 
uninsurable by most insurance plans from the moment he was born. So for 
a long time Rod found himself forced into purely catastrophic insurance 
with a very high premium that wouldn't cover much of anything. That 
changed for him with the Affordable Care Act.
  Despite his heart defect, Rod was able to get a plan that covers him 
and his wife, and they found out they were eligible for tax credits to 
help pay for it. So today both Rod and Sarah are covered through a 
silver plan with lower premiums than the plan that only covered Rod if 
the worst happened.
  I know we have a number of other colleagues who are here to speak, 
and I note some of them are here to tell stories from their own States, 
but I would like to note that I only told three stories today of people 
who are benefiting from the Affordable Care Act. These are only 3 
people among the 400,000 others in my home State of Washington who have 
now signed up for care through the exchange, Washington 
Healthplanfinder, and they are only 3 people among the 4 million people 
who have signed up across the country. For the most part, their stories 
are not unique. Millions of other Americans face the same kind of 
health care problems they do. It is time that we stop ignoring that 
reality. It is time that we do our job and help our constituents get 
the health care coverage they deserve and can now get under this law.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.


                       IRS 501(c)(4) Regulations

  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I understand Senator Schumer wants to 
speak in a little while, so I will try to hurry my remarks as quickly 
as I can.
  I rise today to speak once again on the proposed IRS regulations 
targeting grassroots 501(c)(4) organizations. I have already come to 
the floor to discuss this issue, and I expect I will be here several 
more times in the coming months as these proposed rules continue to 
move through the regulatory pipeline at the IRS.
  The public comment period for these proposed regulations ends today. 
As of this morning, the IRS had received over 100,000 comments on this 
proposal, the vast majority of them negative. This is an all-time 
record. In fact, the number is more than five times greater than the 
previous record for comments on a proposed IRS regulation. By contrast, 
the Keystone XL Pipeline--another item of enormous public interest--
received just over 7,000 comments.
  With all this public attention, the obvious question is, Why? Why has 
this proposal generated so much criticism from the American people? I 
think the answer is quite simple: The American people see this proposal 
for what it is--an attempt to silence this administration's critics and 
keep them on the sidelines of the democratic process.
  I would like to take a few minutes to describe in detail just what 
this regulation does.
  Under the Internal Revenue Code, a 501(c)(4) organization is a 
nonprofit organization, the exempt purpose of which is the ``promotion 
of social welfare.'' The phrase ``promotion of social welfare'' has 
long been defined as ``promoting in some way the common good and 
general welfare of the people of the community'' or ``bringing about 
civic betterments and social improvements.''
  Such organizations may engage in political activity for or against 
candidates for public office so long as their primary activity falls 
under the category of promoting social welfare.
  Under current regulations, activities such as voter registration or 
``get out

[[Page S1214]]

the vote'' drives are correctly treated as promoting social welfare, 
just like the distribution of voter guidelines outlining candidates' 
positions on issues that are, in the view of the organization, 
important to the public.
  The proposed regulations would re-categorize these types of 
candidate-neutral activities as not consistent with the exempt purpose 
of promoting social welfare. This is important because over the past 
few days, in an effort to justify these regulations, the administration 
has communicated to Members of Congress that they are not banning these 
types of activities; they are just putting them in different 
categories. But lost in their justifications are some important 
distinctions. It is easy to get lost in the weeds, which is probably 
what the administration is hoping for. So let's break this down.
  Traditionally speaking, in order to keep their tax exemption, 
501(c)(4) organizations have had to limit their involvement in 
``political activities'' to around 49 percent or less of their overall 
activities. In other words, they can be directly involved in the 
political process so long as the majority of their activities are 
devoted to social welfare.
  What this proposed regulation would do is redefine the parameters of 
what is considered political activity, moving a number of activities 
from the social welfare category to the political category. As I said, 
under this regulation, simply stating where candidates for public 
office stand on issues important to a specific 501(c)(4) organization 
would be considered political activity. In fact, even mentioning a 
candidate's name in a communication within a specified period before an 
election--even if the communication does not say whether the 
organization supports or opposes the candidate--would be considered 
political activity. As I mentioned, the same could be said for voter 
registration drives or ``get out the vote'' initiatives even if the 
efforts are obviously and legitimately nonpartisan.
  Basically, this proposed regulation would instantly categorize so 
much run-of-the-mill behavior as partisan political activity that many 
existing 501(c)(4) grassroots organizations would have to stop 
promoting their causes altogether. And that is precisely what the 
administration wants. They do not want 501(c)(4)s educating the public 
on the issues of the day or telling voters where candidates stand on 
political issues. Sure, they are fine with these groups promoting 
social welfare so long as that promotion does not include criticism of 
this administration or its policies that are harmful to the general 
welfare of their communities.
  It would be one thing if the IRS was an agency with clean hands when 
it came to dealing with critics of this administration. But, as we have 
seen, that is simply not the case. Indeed, over the last few years we 
have seen a record of harassment and intimidation of conservative 
groups applying to the IRS for tax-exempt status. The agency is under 
investigation in three separate congressional committees for its 
actions in the run up to the 2010 and 2012 elections.
  Put simply, the credibility and the political independence of the IRS 
are very much in question. A reasonable person would think that, rather 
than further damaging the IRS's reputation, the administration would 
instead focus on rebuilding it in the aftermath of the targeting 
scandal. Sadly, there don't appear to be too many reasonable people 
working in the Obama administration, at least not when it comes to this 
set of issues.
  We need to call this what it is: an affront to free speech and the 
right of all American citizens to participate in the democratic 
process. This is an attempt by the administration to marginalize its 
critics and silence them altogether.
  Republicans have been very vocal in our opposition to this proposed 
regulation. We have spoken out in a variety of venues. But make no 
mistake, it is not just Republicans and conservatives who oppose this 
new rule. A number of left-leaning organizations have spoken out 
against it as well. The ACLU, for example, submitted a scathing comment 
letter to the IRS arguing that the proposed regulation would ``produce 
the same structural issues at the IRS that led to the use of 
inappropriate criteria in the selection of various charitable and 
social welfare groups for unfair scrutiny.'' The ACLU argued further 
that social welfare groups should be free to participate in the 
political process because that kind of participation ``is at the heart 
of our representative democracy. To the extent it influences voters, it 
does so by promoting an informed citizenry.'' We have seen similar 
comments from groups such as the Sierra Club. Leaders of labor unions 
have also publicly weighed in about the overly broad nature of the 
proposed regulation.
  Put simply, when you have a proposal that is drawing unanimous 
opposition from Republicans in Congress and is being criticized by the 
ACLU and Big Labor, there is a pretty decent chance it is not good 
policy. Quite frankly, that characterization is probably too charitable 
for this particular proposal.
  This proposed regulation needs to be stopped in its tracks. Yesterday 
the House of Representatives passed legislation that would do just 
that. If enacted, the House bill would delay the implementation of the 
proposal for one year. I am an original cosponsor of the Senate 
companion bill to this legislation, which was introduced by Senators 
Flake and Roberts.
  Sadly, I think I know where my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle stand on this issue, and I expect those of us here in the Senate 
who support the right of all Americans to participate in the political 
process are likely to be disappointed with regard to this particular 
legislative effort. Still, even if this legislation dies here in the 
Senate, that will not be the end of the line.
  Earlier this month, when I came to the floor to talk about this 
issue, I called on IRS Commissioner Koskinen to use his authority to 
block these regulations. I expect him to do so. When questioned about 
this proposal, he has consistently deferred, usually saying he was not 
the Commissioner when it was drafted and published. Fine. But he is the 
Commissioner now, and now that he is the Commissioner, he is in a 
position to stop the proposed regulation from going final and acquiring 
the force of law. This proposal cannot take effect unless Commissioner 
Koskinen personally approves and signs the final regulation clearance 
package. That being the case, I call on him today to do the right 
thing--to not sign it when it reaches his desk. In fact, he ought to 
decry it for what it is.
  In an ideal world, the administration would simply withdraw this 
proposal and leave this issue alone. However, we are not living in such 
a world. That being the case, if the administration continues its 
effort to push through this proposed rule, the IRS Commissioner can and 
should use his authority to stop it from taking effect. After all, that 
is one reason Congress gives the IRS Commissioner a 5-year term. The 
Commissioner is supposed to be free from political pressure when making 
decisions and implementing our Nation's tax laws.
  In light of that fact, I want to implore Commissioner Koskinen to use 
the power he has been granted to restore the IRS's credibility and make 
it clear to the American people that his agency, the IRS, will no 
longer be used as simply another political arm of this or any future 
administration. I hope he will do so because it is the right thing to 
do, and I am calling on him to do it.

  I have faith in Commissioner Koskinen. I believe he is an honest man. 
I don't think he has any other choice but to stop these obnoxious 
regulations which people from the left to the right consider to be 
breaches of free speech and are wrong.
  I yield the floor.


                          Affordable Care Act

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, over the next several months the 
Affordable Care Act is going to become less important as a Republican 
campaign issue because more and more Americans--from young adults all 
the way through seniors--are going to realize the benefits it has to 
offer. It is happening already.
  Every day there are more positive stories about people getting 
cheaper coverage, better coverage or coverage for the first time. Let 
me say, in my State of New York the initial rollout of ACA has been a 
big success. We didn't have the problems of a Web site because we did 
our own, and because we have a lot of competition, as was intended on 
the exchanges, people are getting very good offers and a large number 
of people are getting their costs reduced.

[[Page S1215]]

  I will tell one story. A friend of mine goes to a hairdresser in a 
conservative neighborhood in New York. The person who owns the beauty 
shop is very conservative, and when the ACA first rolled out she was 
very upset. She said: Look. I have looked at that Web site. I am a nice 
person. I pay for health care for my eight employees. It is going to 
cost me hundreds of dollars more for each employee. I don't even know 
if I can afford to stay in business. That person talked to all of her 
friends, I think she blogged on her Web site, and talked all about it.
  I spoke to my friend a few weeks ago. Guess what. This same person 
actually got health care on the New York Web site which reduced the 
cost of health care for employees by a couple of hundred dollars each. 
She was very happy. Of course, I asked my friend to make sure she puts 
that on her Web site and tells all of her conservative friends about 
that.
  But this story is going to be repeated over and over. There are going 
to be millions of seniors who realize they can get a free checkup and 
keep their health good. There are going to be millions of young people 
who realize they can continue their health care and stay on their 
parents' health insurance from age 21 to 26. Millions of people are 
going to find out that either, God forbid, someone in their family or 
someone in a family they know has a preexisting condition, and now they 
can get health care. Millions of businesses are going to see the cost 
of health care is actually going up at a much smaller rate than they 
are used to. So all these good things will start mounting and the 
positives about ACA will grow in the public's mind and eventually I 
believe it will catch up in the Senate and the House. Then something 
else too will happen and that is this: Lots of people who are not 
affected directly by ACA have had fear put into their souls. They 
listen to the rightwing talk radio and they hear: Oh, they may lose all 
their health care or their costs will go way up. But what they are 
finding is it is not happening.
  I met a firefighter who works for New York City--not a volunteer 
firefighter--a few months ago. He said: I know ObamaCare is going to 
kill me. It is going to greatly reduce the health care I am getting as 
a New York City firefighter.
  They get very good health care and they should. They are risking 
their lives for us. He said: It is going to happen, I hear, in the new 
year, January 1, 2014.
  I saw the firefighter a few weeks ago, and he said to me: Hey, I 
still have my health care and nothing changed. Well, of course nothing 
changed. All the horror stories which have been launched by so many on 
the rightwing talk radio and those who just hate ObamaCare, whether it 
works or not, are starting to fade.
  So we are seeing two things happen at once: We are seeing the 
positives increase and the negatives decrease and we are seeing it 
particularly with senior citizens. Because the doughnut hole is filled, 
millions of our senior citizens are spending much less on prescription 
drugs than they had to. It is a huge benefit to them. Since ACA was 
enacted, more than 7 million seniors and people with disabilities have 
saved $9 billion. That is a huge amount of money. To seniors, many of 
whom are on fixed incomes, that is dramatic savings for them.
  Something else is happening to our seniors. They are getting free 
checkups. That does two things. First, it saves money out of their own 
pockets but, second, it reduces our health care costs because we all 
know an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
  Free checkups are that prevention we need. It will not only save the 
seniors but save our system billions and billions of dollars in the 
years and decades to come. Somebody who finds a growth on their skin 
and gets it removed before it becomes cancerous, somebody who might get 
a colonoscopy, a mammogram or a prostate exam and is saved from 
prostate cancer--all that is going to happen.
  So the bottom line is very simple: People are learning the positives 
of ACA. The Web site is being improved. More people are signing up. In 
my State of New York alone, more than 250,000 people with Medicare 
saved $246 million on prescription drugs. The numbers are higher when 
we count up to today because that was only the first 10 months, through 
November 1 of 2013. The benefits are all over the place.
  One other thing. This is not our subject of the week, but I think we 
have to keep mentioning it. We are reducing the budget deficit through 
the ACA. I know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very 
careful about the budget deficit. Good. They should be. Health care 
costs are declining and declining significantly. Some is due to the 
recession, but almost every expert says much is due to the ACA.
  National health care expenditures, for instance, in 2012 grew by 3.7 
percent, meaning that the growth from 2009 to 2012 was the slowest 
since government collected this information in the 1960s. The 
percentage of health care spending for the first time actually shrunk 
from 17.3 to 17.2. At the same time, the solvency of Medicare's 
hospital insurance fund increased and costs declined. So this is great 
news.
  The bottom line: I know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
think they hit political goals when they attack the ACA and call for 
its repeal, but the American people don't want repeal. Secondly, as we 
move on in time the positives of ACA will become more apparent, the 
negatives people perceive of ACA will decline, and I believe by 
November this issue will not be the political gold mine our colleagues 
think it is.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Massachusetts.
  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Schumer for his great 
leadership on this issue and his strong words.
  I am pleased to join with my colleagues on the floor to speak about 
the positive impacts of the Affordable Care Act and the impact it is 
having on our Nation's health and particularly the health of our 
seniors.
  We have all heard about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act in 
terms of increasing coverage: Over 4 million people have already signed 
up for the affordable private health insurance through the State and 
Federal exchanges, millions more have signed up for Medicaid coverage, 
and millions more young people are now able to stay on their parents' 
insurance policies until they are 26--and the numbers are growing.
  But as important as these figures are, the Affordable Care Act isn't 
just about expanding coverage for the uninsured. It is also about 
improving the quality of care and the quality of coverage for all 
Americans, including our seniors.
  Seniors in this country rely on the Medicare Program--and they should 
rely on the Medicare Program--because Medicare respects a promise that 
we made as a country to ensure that people who contribute to the 
program during their working years will have their health care needs 
taken care of after the age of 65. We have a duty to keep that promise, 
and we need to build on that promise.
  To keep the promise of Medicare, we have to make sure the program 
stays afloat. The Affordable Care Act does this by improving the 
quality of care, by coordinating care, and by better delivering under 
Medicare so we reduce waste in the program and we use Medicare dollars 
in a way that improves health outcomes for our seniors.
  The Republicans have a very different approach to Medicare solvency. 
They want to reduce benefits, they want to increase premiums and copays 
so it is harder for seniors to afford to go to a doctor, and they even 
want to end Medicare's guaranteed benefits entirely by turning it into 
a voucher system. Think about that: lower benefits, charge more, and 
end Medicare as we know it.
  These approaches are wrong. They do not reflect our values, and they 
also don't reflect good policy because cutting Medicare benefits will 
not stop seniors from having heart attacks, it will not stop seniors 
from getting sick. It will just push them into emergency rooms and 
private insurance systems--which is more expensive and less efficient 
than Medicare--or, worse, it will prevent them entirely from getting 
the medical care they need.
  Fortunately, the Republican vision is not the law of the land. The 
Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, and it is already showing 
progress in improving the solvency of Medicare and the quality of care 
for our seniors.

[[Page S1216]]

  We can already see how the accountable care organizations created 
under the Affordable Care Act are saving money. The pioneer accountable 
care organizations--five of which are now operating in Massachusetts--
have already saved Medicare nearly $147 million while continuing to 
deliver high-quality care. New standards for hospital reimbursements 
have reduced the number of people who need to be readmitted, meaning 
that for seniors 130,000 fewer Medicare beneficiaries had to check back 
into a hospital last year.
  Thanks to these and other changes, the Medicare trust fund will be 
solvent for nearly 10 years longer than was projected before we passed 
the Affordable Care Act. The results are clear. When it comes to our 
seniors, the Affordable Care Act is saving money and saving lives.
  But the Affordable Care Act does more. It builds on the promise of 
Medicare by improving prevention coverage and reducing actual out-of-
pockets for our seniors. Last year over 70 percent of seniors--25.4 
million people in Medicare--visited their doctor and received a 
preventive service, such as a critical colonoscopy or a lifesaving 
mammogram. They received it for free because of the Affordable Care 
Act. Despite high drug prices, the average senior in America saved an 
average of $1,200 on their prescription drugs in 2013 because of the 
Affordable Care Act closing the doughnut hole in Medicare Part D 
prescription drug coverage. The Affordable Care Act has made these 
changes--reducing the cost for seniors, expanding benefits and reducing 
wasteful spending at the same time that we have improved the solvency 
of Medicare.

  When I hear Republicans talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, 
I wonder what alternative universe they are living in. In this real 
world there should be no confusion about what repealing the Affordable 
Care Act would actually mean for our seniors: higher costs for 
prescription drugs, higher costs for preventive services, reduced 
benefits, and a Medicare program that would go bankrupt nearly 10 years 
sooner.
  The Affordable Care Act is working to help seniors with their 
expenses and to keep the costs of health care down. We need to improve 
and build on the progress the law has made and not argue over tearing 
it down. This should not be about politics. This should be about 
keeping the promise we made to our seniors. It is about building on 
that promise, and I will continue to fight for that.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Connecticut.
  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues--Senator 
Warren, Senator Schumer, and Senator Murray--joining us on the floor 
today. I think we will be joined by Senator Stabenow in a few moments. 
I also appreciate that they were at an event we did yesterday in which 
we were kicking off the Affordable Care Works Campaign. The campaign is 
designed to tell what has been untold for much of the last 6 months, 
which is the increasing good news about the millions of Americans for 
which the Affordable Care Act is working and, indeed for many of them, 
changing their lives.
  An announcement was made this week that 4 million Americans have now 
signed up for the private health care exchanges. There are now over 10 
million Americans all across the country who now have insurance today 
that didn't have it prior to the passage of the law either because of 
these private exchanges or increased eligibility of Medicaid or the 
law's provision that young men and women under the age of 26 can stay 
on their parents' insurance. Over 10 million people all across the 
country now have access to insurance that they didn't have before we 
passed this law.
  As Senator Schume.."

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 7, 2012

  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 436 but I am 
opposed to the Medical Device Excise Tax. I support the Affordable Care 
Act, but just like all bills, it was not perfect.
  In Texas, the medical device industry supports nearly 55,000 jobs. It 
is an industry at the cutting edge of technological innovation

[[Page E1032]]

and is critical to addressing many of the health challenges we face now 
and will in future. I believe this industry, just like any other, 
should pay their fair share, but I am worried that a tax like this will 
chill innovation. The tax is on revenue and not profits, which will 
have a disproportionate effect on small and mid-sized companies. 
Medical devices are incredibly expensive to develop and it takes a lot 
of revenue to offset overhead. By taxing revenue, instead of profit, it 
adds additional costs. Most business taxes are calculated on the 
profits after expenses, but this one is not.
  A company near our district in Houston, Cyberonics, employs hundreds 
of Americans. A few years ago, I toured their facilities. I was 
surprised to learn that they did all of their manufacturing in-house, 
in Houston. This is an increasingly rare way to do business, but one we 
should encourage. Their company is a good example of American 
innovation and entrepreneurship. I am concerned that the way this tax 
is structured, it will negatively impact Cyberonics and companies like 
it. We should be taking steps to support research, design, and 
manufacturing job growth in our country.
  While I oppose this tax, I am also opposed to the way this bill pays 
for the repeal of the tax. We should not replace a poorly designed 
policy with more poorly designed policies. This bill shifts the cost on 
to low and middle income earners and potentially risks their health 
insurance coverage under ACA.
  We should find a better way to fix this and I want to work with my 
colleagues to craft a compromise that will not endanger American jobs 
but at the same time won't shift significant costs on to those who can 
least afford it.

                     HEALTH CARE EXCHANGES WORKING

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, today marks day 7 since the rollout of the 
health care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Listening to the 
hysterical rhetoric from the majority party in the House, you would 
think that America's basic freedoms and economy would be in ruins after 
day 7. And in fact, there have been some problems in terms of some of 
the accessing through the database that was set up.
  Part of the problem was the fact that millions of Americans, far more 
than anyone expected, even the most ardent supporters of the law, have 
swamped the system, which, if you think about it, I think speaks 
volumes about the fact that there is a tremendous need out there for 
this affordable care--which, again, the law I think made an historic 
step in terms of advancing it.
  I am proud of the fact that coming from the State of Connecticut, 
which, again, is one of the States that did not stonewall the 
legislation, Governor Malloy moved forward as quickly as possible and 
set up a system that was actually ready last week to deal with the 
onslaught of emails and calls into the call centers. As of Friday, they 
tallied over 100,000 contacts that came into the system. Again, they 
enrolled actually over a thousand people even though, again, coverage 
doesn't even begin until January.
  So for a lot of people, again, the need to enroll right away doesn't 
exist right now because you have to actually write a check if you are 
going to enroll this early. But nonetheless, still, a thousand people 
have already signed up. And as I said, 100,000 were able to contact the 
system and interacted with it with little or no problem.
  First of all, I would just like to again congratulate Lieutenant 
Governor Nancy Wyman, who has been sort of shepherding and 
quarterbacking this process over the last few months or so, again, to 
make sure that Connecticut's system was ready.
  And I wanted to share, again, a couple of the stories of individuals 
who contacted the Connecticut Health Exchange over the last week or so 
to describe their experiences. There was 48-year-old Elly Baros, who 
said that she was pleased to be one step closer to enrolling in health 
insurance. The New Britain woman, who spent the entire afternoon at the 
health center going through her options, has been without coverage for 
a year and a half due to a layoff.
  She said that she has been holding her breath, thanking God every day 
``I don't get sick or get into a car accident.'' She was excited to 
learn that she could get good individual coverage for about $70 to $200 
a month or possibly even qualify for expanded Medicaid coverage.
  I had a conversation and an email with a woman from Norwich, who is a 
50-year-old, self-employed individual, who said to me:

       I currently pay $980 a month for coverage for myself. I 
     have a rare preexisting condition known as trigeminal 
     neuralgia, which is treated by medication in four annual 
     visits to my doctor. For this, I am considered a ``heavy 
     utilizer.'' My condition interferes with my ability to earn.

  Right now, what she is paying is on par with her mortgage payment.

       After speaking with my insurance agent, I found out that my 
     premiums under the Affordable Care Act will be cut to $440 a 
     month.

  When I spoke to her on the phone the other day, she said when her 
agent called her and gave her this news she did a happy dance in her 
office, knowing that her health insurance premiums were going to be cut 
in half. Again, a 50-year-old, working individual who is now paying 
$980 a month is seeing her health insurance bill cut in half because of 
the health care exchange.
  She is one of these people who has contacted the system, but she 
hasn't enrolled yet, but she will. Believe me. She cannot believe that 
we are at a point right now where there is a concerted, intentional 
effort to shut the government down in an effort to deny her--somebody 
who, again, has a preexisting condition--access to a smarter, more 
rational marketplace than the one that exists today.
  The stories go on and on.
  I have a letter from an individual who actually wrote to The New York 
Times, talking about the fact that on day 1 there were reports about 
how terrible the system is. She said:

       I tried to sign up. I had absolutely no difficulty getting 
     all the answers I needed and all the forms to fill out on the 
     very first try. The entire process was simple, direct, and 
     easy to follow. Please don't forget all of us who, while 
     maybe not newsworthy, are a large part of the equation.

  Her name is Hu Lindsay from Norwalk, Connecticut.
  So, again, the folks at the health care exchange who have been 
planning and preparing for months have demonstrated that that demand 
can be met if you have the right planning in place and that, when 
people actually have a chance to get past all the nonsense that is 
thrown around out there about the end of American freedom and actually 
see that they can buy private health insurance plans--again, 
Connecticut offers three private health insurance plans, Anthem Blue 
Cross, ConnectiCare, and Healthy Connecticut--the system will work. 
That's why we must keep this government open and not buckle to the 
folks who want to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act.

                          ____________________

                 HEALTH CARE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2012

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 7, 2012

  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
discuss my vote on H.R. 436, the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 
2011. As many of my colleagues know, I helped lead the charge 
throughout the 2010 healthcare debate to ensure the medical device 
industry was not overly burdened by the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act (ACA). During negotiations on the final healthcare 
bill, I made it a point to argue that overly taxing the medical device 
industry would stump innovation, affect patient care quality and burden 
an already struggling job market. When we came together to discuss 
health care reform, we agreed that it was necessary for everyone to 
contribute in order to ensure a successful outcome. That is why I 
fought tirelessly, within my own caucus, to make sure the bill was 
responsible in the way Congress paid for the legislation.
  As we approach the 2014 deadline of final implementation for ACA, 
many uncertainties have arisen from both the general public and 
business community. The Republican Majority has addressed this growing 
concern with an onslaught on key revenue provisions of the ACA. In 
fact, they have paid for those repeals by targeting programs from those 
individuals who need ACA the most. For that reason, I was forced to 
vote against H.R. 436, which CBO estimated, if enacted, could remove 
over 350,000 individuals off of health care. Given that many of my 
constituents rely on the health care benefits provided by the ACA, I 
could not support this bill as written.
  However, as the full implementation moves forward, I will continue to 
monitor the effects of this legislation on the medical device industry. 
If the capacity that is anticipated to flood the markets does not 
become realized, I am ready and willing to work with the medical device 
industry to unburden them of any unnecessary taxes, while responsibly 
ensuring that the rest of the ACA moves forward.

                               speech of

                            HON. LOIS CAPPS

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 7, 2012

  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of concern regarding the 
Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2011 (H.R. 436).
  I am extremely disappointed that this bill, which addresses important 
issues, was needlessly injected with partisanship.
  The medical device industry is integral to both our health care 
system and our economy.
  Regardless of our political leanings, we should all be able to agree 
that it is in all of our best interests to support a thriving domestic 
medical device industry.
  I have met with a variety of people on this issue--innovators, 
manufacturers, patients, consumer advocates, and many other 
stakeholders.
  I understand their concerns about the impact that this policy would 
have, especially on small firms and in California, and wish we had the 
opportunity to look at a range of options to address them.
  Unfortunately, in the bill before us, the House Majority has once 
again found a way to poison a bill by slashing important insurance 
provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
  Yet again they have shown that they are willing to disregard American 
families in order to get a pithy sound bite and further their own 
divisive agenda.
  By removing protections for low- and moderate income families who 
receive subsidies to purchase private health insurance, this bill pits 
American families verse manufacturers.
  It essentially punishes people for improving their situation by 
getting a new job or a raise.
  The result? According to the Congressional Budget Office, an 
estimated 350,000 families would be added to the uninsured ranks, and 
others would be left debating between going for a promotion or paying a 
hefty tax bill.
  Health care is a right deserved by all, and shouldn't come with fear 
of punishment.
  And the idea of asking American families to choose between having 
health insurance and improving their financial situations is 
preposterous.
  Through this bill, the other side has shown that they are more 
concerned with dismantling health care reform than ensuring that the 
American people have access to health care.
  And therefore I cannot vote for it.

                          ____________________

                           INDIAN HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. GRIJALVA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, the middle class and men and women 
looking for work in this country are asking: Where are the jobs?
  The Republican majority in the House will be responding, once again, 
by voting to take away health coverage to struggling Americans. For 
instance, instead of bringing a jobs bill or a fair taxation bill up to 
the floor, we will be taking away health care from a very significant 
and important group of Americans--the first Americans--the American 
Indians.
  By upholding health reform, the Supreme Court decision affirmed that 
the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act 
was also part of the decision. The National Congress of American 
Indians responded by stating:

       This is an important step for health care in Indian 
     Country. The permanence of the Indian Health Care Improvement 
     Act has been affirmed.

  The Affordable Care Act permanently authorizes the daily health care 
delivery to nearly 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who 
are in critical need of improved health care and services to their 
communities. There will be critical updates and modernizations, 
expanded cancer screenings, long-term care, hospice care, and care for 
the elderly and the disabled.
  The passage of health care reform represented a 14-year struggle by 
tribal leaders to make permanent a legislative commitment by the 
Federal Government that had not been upheld. It is wrong for the 
Republicans to take this promise away from Indian Country and from the 
first Americans of this country. Americans want a jobs plan, not their 
health care taken away.

                               speech of

                          HON. GARY C. PETERS

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 15, 2013

  Mr. PETERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a 
temporary, one year extension of health care plans in the individual 
market. Although this bill isn't perfect, I believe it is important 
that Congress works together to give Michigan residents certainty and 
stability in their healthcare choices while the Administration works 
out the problems in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
  I want to emphasize my support for health care reform. I voted for 
this important law in 2010, and have voted 40 times against efforts to 
repeal and dismantle health care reform. However, many of my 
constituents have called my office confused by the cancellation letters 
sent by insurers. Compounding this confusion is the ongoing technology 
glitches that are keeping people from signing up on the exchanges and 
learning about new options for health insurance.
  At a time when too many Michigan families are still struggling 
economically, it is important that we keep our promises that the law 
would allow you to keep your insurance and doctor if you want to.
  The President announced his plan to grandfather in health care plans 
that have been recently canceled, but I believe that Congress must also 
vote to support that decision legislatively. I believe that this 
temporary, one year extension of health care plans is necessary while 
people can get the information they need to make the right choices for 
their family on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.
  I support the President's requirement to have insurers disclose 
better information about these grandfathered plans and new plans that 
might be available. That is why I also joined in sending a letter to 
Secretary Sebelius stating that we must require insurers to explain to 
policyholders what benefits they would be losing under the 
grandfathered plans, and the tax credits and subsidies they could be 
eligible for in the new insurance marketplace. We must ensure that 
insurance companies provide a clear explanation when any future changes 
to plans are not a requirement of the Affordable Care Act.
  As I have always said, I am willing to work in order to make 
improvements to ACA as they are needed. Clearly a fix is needed to 
ensure that people can keep their insurance if they like it. It is 
important that we work together to give certainty on this issue, and 
Congress should pass a bipartisan bill to achieve this goal.

   SUSPENDING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY LAW EQUALS FAIRNESS ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                         HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 5, 2014

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4118, 
the 50th vote to undermine the Affordable Care Act.
  First, let me say, I'm concerned that many Marylanders, including my 
constituents, are struggling to sign up for health insurance through 
the state-based Marketplace due to technical issues. With open 
enrollment coming to a close at the end of the month, I urge the 
Administration, state governments, and insurance carriers to come 
together to assist applicants in getting eligibility determinations and 
enrolling in coverage as soon as possible. I appreciated the guidance 
provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) last 
week that would allow consumers the possibility of qualifying 
retroactive health insurance, tax credits and cost-sharing assistance. 
It's critical that CMS clarify that those individuals who take 
retroactive coverage will be protected from any undue penalties for the 
months prior to the effective date of retroactive coverage.
  The bill on the floor today is not about helping Marylanders or any 
other Americans, but rather about dismantling the Affordable Care Act 
and putting health insurance further out of reach for them. I want to 
be clear: the requirement that individuals take responsibility for 
ensuring they have adequate health insurance coverage was an idea 
espoused by the Heritage Foundation in the late 1980s. It was carefully 
crafted and includes exemptions for individuals facing hardships and 
those who can't afford insurance. Delaying the provision for everyone 
for a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would 
increase the number of uninsured by one million this year and two 
million in 2015, and lead to higher premiums. It's obvious that 
delaying the provision will undermine the protections and reforms that 
have taken effect and will introduce more instability into market.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the House leadership to put an end to these 
Affordable Care Act repeal votes. We want to work with you to identify 
parts of the law that can be improved and develop serious solutions. 
Unfortunately, today's bill is not one of them. I urge my colleagues to 
oppose it.

                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to continue 
to urge my colleagues for quick passage of my legislation that would 
restore access to life-saving medicines for children's hospitals.
  As my colleagues are aware, I introduced independent legislation in 
September that would protect the lives of the most vulnerable among 
us--our Nation's children--by immediately restoring access and ensuring 
children's hospitals across the country are able to purchase orphan 
drugs at a discount.
  Children's hospitals lost access to these medicines when Congress 
passed

[[Page S8344]]

the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  That wasn't right.
  And so my legislation sought to fix it and restore access to these 
life-saving medicines for children's hospitals. Without this fix, 
children's hospitals across the country will be faced with higher drug 
costs. I introduced this legislation with the support of several of my 
Republican colleagues. And I know that my Democratic colleagues support 
the intent of my legislation too.
  Unfortunately, and despite passage in the House, the Senate has not 
passed legislation to correct this flaw in the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act.
  But I am hopeful that the Senate will take action soon. I continue to 
work with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and with Senate 
leadership to ensure that the Senate acts swiftly to correct this error 
in the Federal health care reform bill.
  As my colleagues are aware, access to orphan drugs are critically 
important to children, many of whom, if they are ill, suffer from rare 
diseases or conditions. Orphan drugs, by definition, are designed and 
developed to help and treat diseases or conditions that affect fewer 
than 200,000 people, many of whom are children. On a daily basis, the 
Children's Hospital of Boston uses most of the 347 medicines that are 
designated orphan drugs.
  I will say again that my legislation has the support of my colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle. And I have this support because fixing 
this provision and restoring access to life-saving medicines is the 
right thing to do.
  My legislation restores and protects the ability for children's 
hospitals to access those outpatient medicines through the 340B drug 
discount program authorized in the Public Health Services Act. Access 
to this program and the corresponding discount saves the Children's 
Hospital of Boston nearly $3 million annually, but more importantly, 
Children's Hospital of Boston is able to save lives as a result. 
Hospitals and doctors at children's hospitals are able to access life-
saving medicines, children live better lives, and families are given 
peace of mind.
  Passing my bill quickly is the right thing to do and I encourage my 
colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly to enact my legislation to 
ensure that children's hospitals can once again receive discounted 
pricing on these life-saving medicines.
  There is no cause for delay. The House has passed this restorative 
language twice already. The Senate needs to do the same. And we should 
do so before the end of this year.
  I believe quick passage is possible--quick passage should be 
possible--because of the support and efforts that I have seen 
demonstrated by my fellow Senators.

         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES ON PUBLIC BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS

  Under clause 2 of rule XIII, reports of committees were delivered to 
the Clerk for printing and reference to the proper calendar, as 
follows:


[[Page H72]]


       Mr. BURGESS: Committee on Rules. House Resolution 455. 
     Resolution providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 
     2279) to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act relating to 
     review of regulations under such Act and to amend the 
     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
     Liability Act of 1980 relating to financial responsibility 
     for classes of facilities; providing for consideration of the 
     bill (H.R. 3362) to amend the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act to require transparency in the operation 
     of American Health Benefit Exchanges; and providing for 
     consideration of the bill (H.R. 3811) to require notification 
     of individuals of breaches of personally identifiable 
     information through Exchanges under the Patient Protection

                           ACA IMPLEMENTATION

  (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, despite my significant frustration with the 
rollout of the Affordable Care Act, I remain committed to increasing 
access to affordable health care for every Granite Stater. To that end, 
I support efforts to ensure that folks who like their current health 
plan can keep them for another year.
  In New Hampshire, Granite Staters already have the option of renewing 
their current plans; and I believe that families across the country 
should be able to do the same, and I will support good-faith efforts to 
do that.
  But the Affordable Care Act is not a perfect law, and I am committed 
to improving it. Make no mistake; we cannot go back to the days when 
insurance companies were free to deny insurance coverage for people 
with preexisting conditions, or simply because they were female and 
their rates would be higher, or to drop people from their plans because 
they got sick, or to drop people from their plans because they grew 
older and were not living in their own home with the family.
  I will continue to work with anybody who is serious about making this 
law work and to ensure that Granite Staters have access to the quality, 
affordable health care that they deserve.

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the Republican leadership 
pulled H.J. Res. 80 from further consideration today. It is the 
American Indian and Alaska Native, Health, Education, and Safety Act.
  The Affordable Care Act, which the Republicans are demanding be 
eliminated in exchange for allowing the government to reopen, includes 
the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement 
Act. As the author of the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care 
Improvement Act, I know the challenges that the reauthorization faced 
and just how long it took for us to finally get it passed into law--a 
decade, in case you are wondering.
  If we yield to Republican hostage-taking and throw out the Affordable 
Care Act, we throw out the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care 
Improvement Act. That would be devastating to Indian country.
  This bill, H.J. Res. 80, continues the damaging sequester cuts that 
the National Congress of American Indians have said pose particular 
hardship for Indian country and the surrounding communities that rely 
on tribes as employers.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to stop this nonsense. If you truly do 
believe in the sacred trust and responsibility our government has to 
tribes, then let's have a vote on a clean CR and reopen the government.

                               OBAMACARE

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, last week the health insurance 
marketplace opened, giving millions access to quality health care. 
Since then, there has been too much focus on the small hiccups that are 
to be expected when any large program is implemented.
  Yesterday, I received a letter from a North Carolina woman who lives 
over 600 miles from my home district in Illinois. Like many 
Illinoisans, she believes the positives of the Affordable Care Act are 
being overlooked. She said:

       My family has already benefited from the Affordable Care 
     Act as I have two children just finishing college. I am 
     relieved I can keep them on my medical coverage at no cost. 
     This saves them money and gives me peace of mind. The cost of 
     our health care plan has decreased by $400.

  Like many, she wants to ask Congress: Is this why you shut down the 
government, to keep me and my children from getting affordable health 
care?
  Citizens are sick and tired of the misinformation being spread about 
the ACA. The ACA didn't cause the shutdown. The shutdown is a symptom 
of what really ails America--cynicism that allows a few to take hollow 
ideological stances at the expense of many.
  Like me, she wants us to pass a clean CR and end this shutdown today.

                               OBAMACARE

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was surprised this morning to hear 
Republicans literally howling over President Obama's decision to ease 
the transition for medium-sized businesses to providing health 
insurance for all of their employees. Republicans have complained that 
health care reform is a burden to employers, but now they are 
complaining that President Obama is trying to ease that burden and 
smooth the transition to a new system. Think about that one.
  But this Republican duplicity should come as no surprise. After all, 
Republicans are the ones who invented the individual mandate. It was 
their idea. It is a conservative idea that every American has a 
responsibility to seek insurance to cover their health care needs, and 
the government has a responsibility to make that coverage accessible 
and affordable. But now Republicans are attacking their own brain 
child--the individual mandate. The individual mandate was their idea, 
and Republicans are willfully ignoring the fact that the Affordable 
Care Act creates a transition period for individuals to obtain 
insurance as well.
  It is time for Republicans to stop talking out of both sides of their 
mouths. If they have legitimate concerns about the Affordable Care Act, 
or ObamaCare, and not just political gripes, they should work with the 
President and the Democrats in Congress to fix and improve the law; 
otherwise, they should stop complaining and get out of the way.

  (Ms. FUDGE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FUDGE. Madam Speaker, prior to the passage of the Affordable Care 
Act, 23 percent of Ohioans with incomes below 133 percent of the 
Federal poverty level were uninsured. But thanks to the expansion of 
Medicaid in my home State of Ohio, all of the almost 600,000 residents 
who are uninsured with incomes below 138 percent of the Federal poverty 
level will now have access to Medicaid coverage.
  In my district alone, an additional 72,000 people became eligible for 
Medicaid. And next Monday, December 9, all of these individuals will be 
able to begin signing up for health care coverage that begins January 
1. No longer will I receive calls from constituents like Brandon 
Proctor, who was told that he was ``too rich for Medicaid but too poor 
for subsidies.''
  This is the way the Affordable Care Act was supposed to work. 
Finally, all Ohioans will have access to quality and affordable health 
care.

            SECRETARY SEBELIUS CONTINUES TO VIOLATE CONGRESS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, last month, it was learned that the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, has been 
calling executives from private groups asking them to fund the 
Affordable Care Act by donating money to a private organization called 
Enroll America. Her actions then were questionable and have left us to 
wonder what the Secretary is promising executives in exchange for their 
support.
  Last Tuesday, Secretary Sebelius disclosed that she solicited three 
additional companies, all of which provide services regulated by her 
agency: a drug maker, Johnson & Johnson; a health care system, 
Ascension Health; and a health insurance provider, Kaiser Permanente.
  And so it begs the question: How far will this administration go to 
promote their flawed takeover of the country's health care?
  Agencies that have already been engrossed in scandal, like the IRS, 
will be directly administering major provisions of the Affordable Care 
Act. Along with them, the Department of Homeland Security, the 
Department of Labor, and the Treasury, these agencies will be involved 
in sharing and tracking consumer information to implement the 
President's law.
  Do you really want to entrust this administration with the 
responsibility of controlling your health care and controlling your 
health care information?

                                  2775

  Mr. REID. I am told there are four bills at the desk due for second 
readings.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bills by 
title for a second time.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1513) to amend the Helium Act to complete the 
     privatization of the Federal helium reserve in a competitive 
     market fashion that ensures stability in the helium markets 
     while protecting the interests of American taxpayers, and for 
     other purposes.
       A bill (S. 1514) to save coal jobs, and for other purposes.
       A bill (H.R. 2009) to prohibit the Secretary of the 
     Treasury from enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
     of 2010.
       A bill (H.R. 2775) to condition the provision of premium 
     and cost-sharing subsidies under the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act upon a certification that a program to

                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ED PERLMUTTER

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 11, 2013

  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, on August 2, 2013 I was not present to 
vote on the Motion to Recommit and Final Passage of H.R. 2009--the 
``Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act of 2013.'' I want to inform you 
that if present I would have voted: ``aye'' on the Motion to Recommit 
to H.R. 2009; and ``nay'' on Final Passage of H.R. 2009.
  The legislation prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury, or any 
delegate of the Secretary, from implementing or enforcing any 
provisions of or amendments made by the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
of 2010.
  This bill marks the 40th time House Republicans have brought forth 
legislation seeking to repeal, obstruct and undermine the Affordable 
Care Act. It is time for Congress to focus on legislation that 
strengthens the middle-class, creates jobs and grows the economy.

                          ____________________

                         THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the House Republicans and 
Congressman Ryan released their budget, which, unfortunately, once 
again seeks to balance the budget on the backs of seniors, the middle 
class, and the most vulnerable among us. The GOP budget presents the 
same failed policies that Americans rejected last fall.
  This budget is full of false realities, fuzzy math, and the wrong 
priorities. Instead of closing the corporate jet loophole, the 
Republican budget ends Medicare as we know it, turning health care for 
seniors into a voucher program. Instead of ending billions in tax 
subsidies for Big Oil, the Republican budget slashes Medicaid for the 
most vulnerable among us, turning it into a block grant program. And 
instead of asking the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share, it 
wants to kick millions of people off health care plans by repealing the 
Affordable Care Act--well, actually, repealing the parts of the 
Affordable Care Act that provide care for people but somehow preserving 
the cost savings and the revenues that it delivers.
  Instead of targeting the most vulnerable communities and placing the 
burden entirely on the middle class, Republicans should work with 
Democrats to put in place a balanced and bipartisan budget that puts 
Americans back to work.

          FOUR YEARS AFTER OBAMACARE, AMERICANS ARE WORSE OFF

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, this is the Affordable Care Act. Yesterday 
marks the 4-year anniversary of when it was signed into law. We all 
knew, at least on the Republican side of this House, how this thing was 
troubled when it was passed 4 years ago, but what no one could have 
predicted was the aggressive incompetence of the administration and the 
agencies during the implementation.
  It is hurting average Americans. I get comments from people back home 
on my Facebook page literally every day. People tell me their stories 
of their health care plans being canceled, their premiums and 
deductibles going up, and trusted access to family doctors being lost.
  Rosie told me her premiums went up 62 percent last year. Heidi's 
husband lost his job because his company was forced to downsize because 
of the law. Kim told me her family's premium has gone up, resulting in 
over $9,000 a year now out-of-pocket, in addition to what they paid 
last year.
  One person put it best, saying: This Affordable Care Act is simply 
not affordable. Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve better.

                               OBAMACARE

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of one of my 
constituents' experiences with the Affordable Care Act, Allan, from 
Santa Barbara County.
  Prior to the Affordable Care Act, his wife was paying $20,000 a year 
in insurance premiums. She has a preexisting condition. Even though it 
costs so much, she was thankful to have any coverage at all.
  When Covered California, our online marketplace, opened, she made a 
call, looked at her options, and found a plan that works for her. This 
plan saved them $8,000 a year, and it was a much better plan.
  We know that the rollout nationally has been sloppy, that the law is 
not perfect, and that there are real issues we must fix. We must fix 
those problems without diminishing the true benefits the law is giving 
to families in my district and across the country. So now is the time 
to work together to ensure all Americans have access to quality, 
affordable health care.

                OBAMACARE INCREASES HEALTHCARE SPENDING

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the White House 
claimed ObamaCare is partially responsible for helping to slow the 
growth rate in health care spending. Health care spending did grow at a 
record slow pace in 2012. Unfortunately, according to NPR:

       The Federal officials who compiled the report disagree with 
     the Obama administration about why.

  That's right. The annual report from the actuaries for the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services disagrees with the White House.
  NPR disagrees as well:

       One thing that did not lead to slower growth, according to 
     the report's authors, was the Affordable Care Act.

  ``It's the recession, not ObamaCare, that is slowing health 
spending,'' writes the National Journal.
  Mr. Speaker, hospital costs are increasing. Out-of-pocket costs 
continue to increase, and any reduction in the rate of growth isn't due 
to the Affordable Care Act.
  A closer look at the numbers shows us that this law has made matters 
worse. A closer look at the numbers tells us more about what the White 
House would rather not discuss. A closer look tells us that the 
American people deserve better.

                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, all we are asking is the President keeps his 
word. I have got hundreds of letters now from constituents from all 
across my entire district.
  Nate from Oakdale says:

       Before the Affordable Care Act, our health coverage was 
     $279 a month for me and my wife. We recently got a letter in 
     the mail stating that our plan is no longer available due to 
     the Affordable Care Act and that our premium will be $434.60 
     a month, an increase of $155.60.

  Tom from Ceres says:

       Farm Bureau has informed me that my med insurance will be 
     canceled in January 2014. My premium will increase 170 
     percent for now.

  Valerie from Denair:

       My policy was canceled. In shopping for a new plan, I see 
     that my monthly cost will at least triple for inferior 
     coverage.

  These lists go on and on and on.
  Dawn from Turlock says:

       I just received a letter today from my health care 
     provider, and they have notified us our health care insurance 
     has just doubled.

  We owe it to the American people that this does not go on any longer. 
The President needs to fulfill his promise.

             ACA RAISES COSTS ON YOUNG AND HEALTHY COVERAGE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, HHS 
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is scheduled to testify before the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee on the massive technological failures of 
the online rollout of the Affordable Care Act; and while some of my 
colleagues would lead you to believe that these are only minor Web site 
glitches, I rise to address a more basic, fundamental flaw in the 
construct of the Affordable Care Act.
  The structure of the design, admittedly by an MIT economist who 
helped create ObamaCare, was to increase rates for the young and 
healthy while decreasing rates for the elderly or sick. The problem is 
this only serves to deter young Americans from purchasing health care 
when faced with the costs of education, a first home, and the prospect 
of starting a family.
  We all want Americans to be covered, but higher premiums for the 
young and healthy to subsidize those who are greater consumers of 
health care was not the bill of goods the American people were 
originally sold. Mr. Speaker, young Americans deserve better.

                            JOBS, JOBS, JOBS

  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it's now been 866 days since I 
arrived in Congress, and the Republican leadership has still not 
allowed a single vote on serious legislation to address our 
unemployment crisis.
  That's zero votes to address our Nation's most pressing emergency. 
That's zero votes to address the sequester policies that are making our 
job crisis immeasurably worse. Yet yesterday, the Republican Congress 
took its 37th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Mr. Speaker, this was not only a colossal waste of valuable time that 
could have been spent focusing on jobs legislation, it's a further step 
in the wrong direction. By expanding access to health care, the 
Affordable Care Act gives Americans more disposable income, creating 
more customers for our businesses and, in turn, more jobs.
  It's time to bring the American Jobs Act to the floor. It deserves a 
vote.
  Investigate Benghazi; investigate the AP leaks; investigate the IRS; 
but, Mr. Speaker, don't forget our focus, our crisis. Our mantra should 
be: jobs, jobs, jobs.

                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address 
what has really been going on behind the scenes in the Affordable Care 
Act. You see, if millions of people didn't lose their coverage, the 
architects of the law knew the exchanges would be full just of sick and 
elderly, without healthier populations subsidizing those plans.
  No matter which way you spin it, the President's broken promises--
this one, in particular--should concern us all. We were promised we 
could keep our policies, coverage, and doctors; yet these choices are 
now being denied for millions of Americans.
  Many of us are not surprised. For the fact of the matter is that the 
Affordable Care Act is not about consumer choice. It is about 
governmental control, control over our lives, control over our 
decisionmaking. This is social engineering at its worst.
  The lackluster performance of a Web site will disappear over time. 
Unfortunately, the insurance cancelations and cost increases are going 
to continue regardless of an executive order or another ``promise'' 
from the White House. The American people deserve better, Mr. Speaker; 
and they surely can't afford more broken promises.

                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise to give voice to my constituents. 
While I would expect that ObamaCare's thousands of pages would help at 
least a handful of people, a sampling of mail coming into any office 
lets me know that help by the Affordable Care Act is rare.
  Steve from Greenfield says he and his wife are in good health with 
current insurance costing $485 a month. Under ObamaCare, that goes to 
roughly $1,150 a month, a 237 percent increase.
  June from Batavia received a letter from UnitedHealthcare. They are 
discontinuing coverage for most of her family's doctors. And while she 
says she can handle it, it will be a problem for her husband. He has 
stage 4 kidney disease and is on dialysis and will soon not have his 
doctors.
  Don from Loveland says:

       If the Affordable Care Act is allowed to stand, my family 
     will have to come up with an extra $6,600 next year. We can't 
     afford that.

  Mr. Speaker, from what I am seeing, stress and anxiety are becoming 
an increasingly common diagnosis, all due to ObamaCare. The Web site 
isn't the only problem, Mr. Speaker, the law is the problem.

                REPEAL THE EMPLOYER MANDATE IN OBAMACARE

  (Mr. BARROW of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BARROW of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, just over a week ago, the 
administration announced a 1-year delay of the employer mandate in the 
Affordable Care Act. While a temporary delay is a good thing for 
businesses, a full repeal would be even better. Businesses in my 
district in Georgia have made very clear that the employer mandate 
would prevent them from expanding their businesses or hiring workers. 
One of the main reasons I voted against the law in the first place was 
because too many job creators in my district simply can't afford the 
costs of the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act.
  We can fix this, however. I'm proud to be leading the effort to fully 
repeal the employer mandate, along with two of my colleagues from 
across the aisle. We know this can be fixed, and we've got the 
bipartisan legislation to do it. I urge my colleagues to swiftly bring 
up the full repeal of the employer mandate and make this delay 
permanent so businesses across the country can get back to creating the 
jobs we need.

                        THE TEA PARTY IS WORRIED

  (Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, so the Tea Party has successfully shut 
down the operations of the Federal Government. And why have they done 
it? Well, they've done it because they're worried:
  They're worried about the danger that the Affordable Care Act is 
going to work and people are going to like it;
  They're worried about the danger that people with preexisting 
conditions are going to be covered;
  They're worried about the danger that women are going to qualify for 
preventative health care services;
  They're worried about the danger that children living at home up to 
age 26 are going to be covered under their parents' insurance policies;
  They're worried about the danger that seniors are going to save money 
on their prescription drugs as the Medicare part D doughnut hole 
closes.
  What they're worried about is that the Affordable Care Act is going 
to work and people are going to like it.
  Mr. Speaker, the Tea Party thinks these things are dangerous, so they 
shut down the government. But with all respect, I say to you, it is the 
Tea Party--it is the Tea Party, itself. They are the danger.

                USE POWER OF THE PURSE TO STOP OBAMACARE

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, how do Yucca Mountain, Iran Contra, and 
the Vietnam War relate to the Affordable Care Act? All of those 
represent legislative limitations of funding to counter decisions made 
by the executive branch. In each instance, Congress used its authority 
provided under the Constitution to place limits on Presidential 
decisions. We need to use those constitutional powers again.
  The Affordable Care Act is lurching toward an uncertain start and is 
dramatically different than what was signed into law over 3 years ago. 
Gone are the CLASS Act and the 1099 business activity reporting 
requirement. What about the Federal preexisting program? It hasn't 
accepted a new patient since February of this year.
  How unfair is it that the large corporations in this country received 
an 11th-hour Presidential exemption and Members of Congress receive a 
subsidy? None of this is available to the average American.
  I look at all of this and I ask: What tools are available to prevent 
this disaster? And the answer is provided in the historical record when 
previous Congresses used the one trump card they have available. All 
that is required is the courage and the clarity of vision to alter 
history.

                 H.R. 1549: A WIN-WIN FOR CONSERVATIVES

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, tomorrow on the floor of this House, we 
will consider H.R. 1549, the Helping Sick Americans Now Act.
  This bill is a win-win for our constituents. It's compassionate 
towards the most vulnerable.
  Unlike other parts of the Affordable Care Act, which only expand 
broken government-run programs, this program will provide private 
health insurance to sick Americans.
  The bill is fiscally responsible. It reduces the country's deficit 
while redirecting funds from a slush fund while the administration uses 
the Prevention and Public Health Fund money to prop up their train 
wreck of implementation for the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives 
actually want to use it to help sick Americans.
  This bill helps those with preexisting conditions that have no other 
options and provides a fiscally conservative policy that reduces the 
deficit.
  I urge Members of the House to support and pass H.R. 1549 when it's 
on the floor tomorrow.

     being taken into account for purposes of the employer mandate

  Mr. REID. Have all three titles been read, Madam President?
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have.
  Mr. REID. I now ask for a second reading of each of the bills but 
object to my own request, en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will 
receive their second reading on the next legislative day.

            IF YOU LIKE YOUR HEALTH PLAN, YOU CAN'T KEEP IT

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, ``If you like your health plan, you will be 
able to keep your health plan.''
  That is what the President said in 2009, but now NBC News is 
reporting that this administration knew for at least 3 years that that 
wasn't true.
  Now millions of hardworking Americans in the individual market will 
not be able to keep their plans even if they like them. People across 
the Nation are experiencing sticker shock as they receive cancelation 
letters from their insurers and see their monthly premiums rise up to 
400 percent. More people have received cancelation letters than have 
enrolled so far through all of the Affordable Care Act exchanges.
  The Affordable Care Act has proven to be anything but. It is time for 
the President and my Democratic colleagues to work with us to suspend 
this flawed law and to work to fix it. We have to find a better way to 
deliver the reforms people really need because this law isn't working.

                             ROLLING ALONG

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is always good to have a number of 
good news stories for my colleagues and the American people, and I am 
delighted to have a good news story, which is that the Affordable Care 
Act is rolling along. I recognize that the most important aspect of 
this law is that Americans, like Kendall Brown in Oklahoma City, are 
having their lives changed in front of their eyes.
  She writes to the President that she has Crohn's disease and she has 
already benefited from the Affordable Care Act by being able to stay on 
her parents' insurance, but now she is able to enroll. And she wrote in 
this letter that as individuals are debating to delay the individual 
mandate--she said:

       Mr. President, if they do it, then this is the last letter 
     that you will receive from me because I will be dead by the 
     time I am 27 years old.

  So the good news is, my friends, enroll. You can use 1-800-318-2596--
30,000 calls and only 20 seconds in wait time. You can use the 
navigators. You can use the outreach efforts. You can even get on the 
Web and be educated. 1-800-318-2596.

                        NO MORE DAMAGING TACTICS

  (Mr. WELCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives has put this 
country through a spectacle these past few months; and it was a 
spectacle that was based on the proposition that it was legitimate to 
actually have a discussion about whether we had to pay our bills.
  Mercifully, we are on the threshold of a bipartisan agreement 
whereby, number one, the Affordable Care Act will be the law of the 
land, and the debate in the future is not about its repeal; it is about 
improving it. It is about facing the challenges of implementation. 
Number two, we are repudiating as legitimate tactics to get your way, 
by any faction--it could be Democrats in the future--the use of tactics 
that do damage, threatening to default on our obligations and shutting 
down the government and inflicting pain on innocent people.
  So this struggle has damaged the institution, but the principles that 
were at stake are now resolved: one, the Affordable Care Act is the law 
of the land; two, you cannot use the tactic of shutdown or the tactic 
of default as a way to get your way on your agenda.

  (Mr. HIMES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, when Senator Cruz took to the Senate floor 
for 21 hours to explain to the American public why the Congress had to 
shut down the government and breach the debt ceiling in order to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act, I listened carefully. One of the themes was, 
make D.C. listen. Make D.C. listen.
  We know, from polling, that 70 percent of Americans oppose shutting 
down the government to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  But I went, on Monday, to listen to a couple of my constituents, 
Tamika Younger and Carla Carey, of Bridgeport. These are two young 
mothers who

[[Page H6430]]

drop their children at Head Start in Bridgeport every single day so 
that they can go off to their jobs to make the money to give those 
children some quality of life.
  Thanks to the Republican government shutdown, there is no Head Start 
in Bridgeport now, and they are scrambling and putting their jobs at 
risk to find something to do with those children they love.
  So, Mr. Speaker, let's make D.C. listen to 70 percent of Americans 
and to Tamika and to Carla, who have very real problems today.

                            ``CRUZ CONTROL''

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I deeply regret that the 
Republicans have shut down the government. They have shut the whole 
thing down. Their 2-year-old plan to shut down the government over the 
Affordable Care Act is as harmful as it is fruitless.
  However, all is not lost. The Republican shutdown can end today if 
the Speaker would simply disengage the ``Cruz control'' and hold a vote 
on a clean bill. This is day 8 of the government shutdown. With the 
debt ceiling vote looming, this is the time for action, not talk.
  You can't negotiate with a Republican Party stuck on ``Cruz control'' 
on something so basic as a clean bill to reopen our government. 
Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues have determined that fealty to 
extreme Tea Party groups is more important than the needs of the people 
they represent.
  It's time to end the stubborn, unreasonable, and mean-spirited 
obsession with killing the Affordable Care Act. The Republican shutdown 
can end today if only the Speaker would allow a vote.

                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, this week, a Republican colleague spoke of 
the need to shut down the government. He said: ``We just want to help 
Americans get past one of the most insidious laws ever created by 
man.'' He was referring to the Affordable Care Act, but his words 
sounded eerily familiar to statements from this body's past.
  A Congressman once said:

       Never in the history of the world has any measure been 
     brought here so insidiously designed as to prevent business 
     recovery--to enslave workers.

  Another one said:

       We cannot stand idly by now as the Nation embarks on an 
     ill-conceived adventure in government medicine, from which 
     the patient will be the ultimate sufferer.

  These aren't quotes about the Affordable Care Act. The quotes are 
from Congressman Taber in 1935, opposing Social Security, and from 
Congressman Hall in 1965, opposing Medicare.
  What if opponents of Social Security and Medicare shut down the 
entire government because they didn't get their way? What if the 
majorities gave into the demands of those on the wrong side of history? 
This country would be very different today.
  These may be forgotten, but this reckless shutdown will not be, and 
the American people will remember who caused it.

                    SAD DAY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, this shutdown was totally brought about by 
the Republican leadership. If you listened to our Democratic leader, 
Nancy Pelosi, when she spoke earlier, she made it quite clear that 
there wasn't any real disagreement with regard to the budget or the 
continuing resolution to keep the government going.
  The fact of the matter is that last night, the Republican leadership 
could have simply passed the clean Senate bill to keep the government 
running, at least for a short period of time, if further negotiations 
were necessary. But that's not what they wanted to do. They wanted to 
shut it down in the name of repealing or defunding the Affordable Care 
Act.
  We've already been through that. We had an election. The Affordable 
Care Act was passed 3 years ago. Those 30 or 40 million Americans who 
have no health insurance can actually sign up today. We should not be 
going through that exercise again for the 41st or 42nd or 43rd time.
  Do not believe the Republican leadership. They wanted to shut this 
place down. They have shut it down. And I don't see any effort to try 
to reopen it. It's a sad day for the American people.

                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, once again, the clock is ticking. And with 
another deadline looming before Congress, Republicans are bullying this 
Nation with the threat of a government shutdown unless we get rid of 
the Affordable Care Act.
  The Republicans have tried over 40 times to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act, and it hasn't gotten them anywhere. Now they've found 
themselves a hostage and they're saying, Give us what we want, or we're 
going to blow up the economy and shut down this government. That will 
cause critical services to be stopped for the American people, which 
could mean that over 3 million veterans will not receive their 
disability benefits, 10 million Americans may not receive their Social 
Security checks on time, and the SEC and EPA will be closed for 
business.
  Careening from one fiscal crisis to the next is no way to run this 
country. That's not how we're supposed to do business. There are enough 
problems in this Nation without Congress manufacturing new ones. Let's 
end this man-made crisis and get to the business of not hurting the 
American people.

                          OBAMACARE EMPLOYMENT

  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, every week I hear from constituents who are 
being hurt by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The law is 
imposing new costs on businesses and workers, reducing take-home pay, 
reducing the number of jobs available, and reducing the number of hours 
employees are working.
  Survey after survey confirms that the anecdotes I hear from back home 
are true for Americans across the country. A survey of 300 accountants 
finds that employers are holding back on hiring workers and that some 
are even paring back their payrolls.
  CNBC reports that doctors are skeptical and confused about the 
implementation of the law. Workers, doctors, and employers have every 
right to be confused since the Affordable Care Act is being implemented 
haphazardly and without regard to the law as it is written. 
Beneficiaries will sign up for subsidies without income verification.
  We don't truly know what we'll get until October, but we can say with 
confidence that it won't be what the President promised years ago. 
Americans won't be saving $2,500 a year, many will lose the coverage 
they have, and others will have to switch to a new doctor.
  Many promises have already been broken, and more disappointment is 
bound to happen.

    OBAMACARE WILL DESTROY THE VERY HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WORKERS

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, here it is, Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, section 1513, page 159, paragraph D, Effective 
Date. This is the section that deals with the so-called ``employer 
responsibility,'' what we call the ``employer mandate,'' the effective 
date as defined in law:

       The amendments made by this section shall apply to the 
     months beginning after December 31, 2013.

  Mr. Speaker, I'd like to bring the House's attention to a letter that 
was submitted to Leader Pelosi and Leader Reid by leaders of some of 
our country's labor unions. This is from James Hoffa from the Teamsters 
Union.

       Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, we have been 
     bringing our deep concerns to the administration seeking 
     reasonable regulatory interpretations to the statute that 
     would help prevent the destruction of nonprofit health plans. 
     As you both know firsthand, our persuasive arguments have 
     been disregarded and met with a stone wall by the White House 
     and the pertinent agencies. This is especially stinging 
     because other stakeholders have repeatedly received 
     successful interpretations for their respective grievances. 
     Most disconcerting of course is last week's huge 
     accommodation for the employer community--extending the 
     statutorily mandated December 31, 2013, deadline for the 
     employer mandate and penalties.

  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, 3 years after the Affordable Care Act was 
signed into law, a law that is already helping millions of Americans, 
our friends on the other side of the aisle are wasting time again on a 
pointless symbolic vote that will never become law and takes us 
backwards.
  For the 37th time, our colleagues are forcing us to vote on repealing 
the Affordable Care Act when they know--they know--it has no chance of 
succeeding.
  For the 37th time, they are voting to allow insurance companies to 
deny coverage to children with preexisting conditions.
  For the 37th time, they are voting to roll back our efforts to not 
allow insurance companies to charge women more just because they are 
women.
  And for the 37th time, they are voting to strip small businesses of 
protections against the skyrocketing insurance premiums we faced long 
before the ACA.
  Einstein used to say: Insanity is when one attempts to do the same 
thing over and over again--expecting a different result.
  This is wrong for the 37th time and a waste of our time.

                       WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE HEALTH

  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, 26 years ago, I was diagnosed with 
ovarian cancer. I was lucky. I had excellent doctors. They detected the 
cancer by chance in stage I. If my cancer had not been caught early, I 
might not be speaking to you today. Many women are not so lucky because 
they have never had access to preventive health care.
  That is why I am so pleased to see that today, thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act, more lifesaving preventive services will begin to 
be covered for women all over the country. Last year, 54 million 
Americans with private health insurance gained access to preventive 
services without cost sharing, including over 700,000 in my State of 
Connecticut.
  Starting today, 47 million American women, including over 600,000 
Connecticut women, will now have access to well-women visits, 
screenings for gestational diabetes, HPV and HIV, contraception, and 
counseling and support for STIs, breast feeding, and for domestic 
violence.
  A report in 2009 found that more than half of American women delayed 
or avoided necessary care because they could not afford it. This is why 
we passed the Affordable Care Act.
  Let's help Americans get quality care. Let's save lives.

[Pages S930-S931]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about the 
letters I have received and the messages we have received in the office 
in the last week regarding the changes we see going on in health care. 
There was quite a bit of discussion last week about how health care 
impacts the workplace, and I think a lot of misinformation is out. The 
Congressional Budget Office projection, as some people have alleged, 
does not say that 2 million more people are going to have part-time 
jobs. It says the equivalent job loss because of the Affordable Health 
Care Act is the equivalent of 2.3 million people losing full-time jobs. 
That may mean that 10 million people who otherwise would have had full-
time jobs have part-time jobs.
  The other thing is, it is three times as big as the number that was 
on the table when people voted for the Affordable Care Act. At that 
time, the Congressional Budget Office said: If this

[[Page S931]]

law passes, there will be 800,000 fewer jobs than if this law does not 
pass. The collective impact on the economy is 800,000 fewer jobs.
  Last week they said there would be 2.3 million fewer jobs--roughly 
three times the amount that the earlier estimate was. Similar to so 
many other estimates in this law, the reality of the law turns out to 
be different than the estimates. Surely that was an estimate that 
nobody wanted. I cannot imagine anybody who voted for this bill--and I 
did not vote for it--but I cannot imagine anybody who voted for this 
bill thought: That is a really great thing. We are going to lose 
800,000 jobs if this bill passes. I assume they thought: The good this 
bill will do will offset losing 800,000 jobs.
  Now we find out it is 2.3 million jobs and all kinds of information 
that the good that was supposedly going to be done is not what people 
had hoped for.
  While we are talking about the workplace, I have a letter from a 
person who is the president of one of our community colleges in the 
State of Missouri. He says because of the Affordable Care Act ``we have 
reviewed all part-time employment to ensure compliance with the 
Affordable Care Act . . . which defines full-time as 30 hours or more 
per week. Without specific guidance in converting credit hours to clock 
hours, we have reduced part-time faculty's teaching loads to ensure'' 
nobody works more than 30 hours.
  This is not the only letter or contact all of us have had on this 
topic. We know the unintended consequence of this law on the workplace 
is that people are now told whom they do not have to insure. State 
governments, community colleges, big companies all looking at a law for 
the first time that supposedly says whom you have to insure--though the 
President certainly feels he has the authority that none of us can find 
anywhere in the law to decide when the law is going to go into effect 
and when it is not--but the law says whom you have to insure, and 
suddenly people who for a long time have provided health care benefits 
because they thought it was the right thing to do or the competitive 
thing to do now respond to this directive from the Federal Government 
that says what you have to do, and that means that is all you have to 
do.
  So all of these employees who may have worked 25 hours, 28 hours, 32 
hours in the past who all got insurance now are suddenly working less 
than 30 hours. I have talked to enough of these employees to know this 
is not because they do not want to work more; this is not because they 
want to make less money; this is not because they want to teach one 
less class; it is because the law has had that kind of impact on the 
workplace.
  The other promises--we are going to get better coverage for less 
cost--surely, somebody is getting better coverage for less cost. But my 
guess is that is a much smaller group than the people who are losing 
their insurance and because of the so-called broader and better 
coverage have more costs.
  Here is a letter from Kathy in Wentzville, MO. She says:

       I carry insurance through a large corporation and my 
     premium increased this year because the minimum standards [in 
     the law] affect my plan.
       Premiums increased by 25 percent.

  She goes on, in no uncertain terms, to suggest that she does not like 
the Affordable Care Act or think it is affordable.
  Jeff from St. Joseph said:

       Thank you for the opportunity to share my family's opinion 
     on ObamaCare. First off I would like to state that we have 
     experienced increases in our health insurance. My employer's 
     insurance has doubled of which I pay \1/2\. My family's 
     separate insurance policy has risen as well with a 
     cancellation due in December. I have considered canceling my 
     [own] health insurance through my employer so that I could 
     provide for my family's [health insurance at their new 
     rates].

  This is a family that a few months ago thought they were going to be 
able to continue to keep what they had. They liked what they had. They 
thought they could afford what they had. Now they are deciding who is 
going to go without insurance so other people can have insurance in the 
family at the higher rate.
  William from St. Louis, MO, says:

       My insurance was canceled in December.

  He says:

       . . . my insurance rates have been drastically increasing 
     each year since the law was passed.
       Four years ago, I had a policy for my family with a $500 
     deductible and the ability to go to any hospital/doctor in 
     St. Louis for $1,000 per month. Now I have a policy with a 
     $2,000 deductible and I can't go to [the doctor I used to go 
     to].

  He says his policy now--that does not allow him to go to the doctor 
he used to go to--does not cost $1,000 a month any longer; it costs 
$1,500 a month.
  Ted in St. Joseph said his doctor has changed the way he does 
business. He says his doctor has downsized the types of plans he 
accepts and is moving to a customer base with higher incomes.
  So Ted's doctor, according to Ted in St. Joseph, has stopped taking 
patients with Blue Cross/Blue Shield because of increased costs, and 
Ted, who by the way liked the doctor he had, now has to find another 
doctor who will take the coverage he can get.

  Steve, in St. Joseph, and his wife are raising their 14-year-old 
grandson, and all three have seen their insurance costs increase--they 
think because of the Affordable Care Act. His grandson's policy went up 
$50 a month, from $104 to $154. His wife's deductible went from $1,000 
per year to $5,000 per year and her insurance costs over $800 a month.
  He goes on to say--and I thought about whether I should read this; I 
assume they have talked about this too. He said: ``If we were to get 
divorced, her premium would be less than $200 per month.'' I think 
Steve is not suggesting that he and his wife should get divorced, but 
he is just talking about, again, the unintended consequences. A family 
who is together cannot afford to have the coverage they had. Her 
coverage is $800 a month, but as a substitute teacher--I believe that 
is what this letter says she does--her income would qualify her for a 
$200-a-month policy instead of the $800 they are paying now.
  Sandy from Armstrong, MO, says she received a letter from her 
insurance company notifying her that her premiums were about to 
increase. She went on healthcare.gov to find plans she and her husband 
could qualify for, and the plans she found were double the premiums she 
had been paying.
  Kelly from Farmington, MO, works in the HR department, the human 
resources department, at a bank. She feels healthy groups will be 
paying more for insurance because of the ACA and because of the 
expanded coverage.
  Her department has received many questions, she says, about health 
care coverage but feels limited in how much they can tell anybody 
because they do not know how the new law is going to apply.
  The law of unintended consequences continues to be the law that 
applies here. Missourians and people all over the country are 
contacting us and asking how much damage we are willing to do to the 
health care system that was working to get more people included in that 
system. There were ways to do this, every one of which I believe was 
legislatively proposed in 2009--small changes that would have made a 
big difference in a health care system that was working for people who 
were in that system. We needed to figure out the few ways to get more 
people in that system. Instead, we have had a dramatic impact on the 
best health care system in the world, and people are beginning to 
figure that out.
  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                           HON. LARRY BUCSHON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 25, 2012

  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight some innovative 
health care programs being implemented by Applied Extrusion 
Technologies in Terre Haute, Indiana. AET Films is a leading supplier 
of specialized oriented polypropylene films in North America.
  In 2005, while being faced with ever increasing insurance premiums, 
they chose to take the path less traveled, empowering their employees 
through a high deductible health plan coupled with a health savings 
account. Over time they further implemented healthy employee incentives 
and education programs to help employees make better consumer-driven 
health decisions. The results of these programs have been irrevocable, 
as AET Films has seen near 0 percent premiums increases since 
implementation.
  With the Supreme Court's recent ruling, and our vote this week to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety for the 4th time, it is 
important to understand the creative steps being taken in the private 
sector that lower health care costs, and incentivize better health 
outcomes--all without government control or interference. I commend AET 
for their innovation, and encourage the Senate and the President to 
join the House in repealing the Affordable Care Act, which dismantles 
innovative programs pursued by AET Films and job creators across the 
United States, and replace it with private sector reforms that lessen 
the cost of health care for all Americans.

                       FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS

  (Mr. COURTNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, our third American President, John Adams, 
once said, ``Facts are stubborn

[[Page H8981]]

things; and whatever may be our wishes . . . or the dictates of our 
passions, they cannot alter the state of facts.''
  Well, Mr. Speaker, the facts are that the health care reform law is 
working for millions of young adults all across this country. 
Yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services released figures 
which show that 2.5 million young Americans up to age 26 are now 
covered because of the Affordable Care Act's provision that allows age 
26 coverage for families. Private and public employers all across 
America now provide this benefit at a cost of only, on average, 1 
percent to health care costs. This is a plan which is working.
  Last week, figures came out that showed that 2.7 million seniors are 
now getting relief from prescription drug costs--$1.5 billion in 
reduced prescriptions drug costs because the Affordable Care Act is 
closing the doughnut hole.
  Facts are stubborn things, and the facts show that the health care 
reform law is helping young Americans and older Americans.

                    REPUBLICAN'S FEAR OF DR. BERWICK

  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow's a sad day. Don Berwick, Dr.

[[Page H8015]]

Berwick, will step down as Administrator of Medicare. It's a bad day 
for seniors.
  But the Senate Republicans are happy because they believe that 
getting rid of Don will end the implementation of the Affordable Care 
Act. When the Senate Republicans blocked a vote on Dr. Berwick, they 
made it possible only for a recess appointment for 18 months. Why do 
the Republicans fear Dr. Berwick so much? Hard to say.
  His career has been spent improving the quality of health care. He 
believes that we can have good quality health care at low cost. They're 
synonymous. He put patients first, believing in evidence-based 
medicine, and collaborates with others in the public good.
  His sin was that he once said a nice word about the British health 
care system, and therefore he has to go.
  Dr. Berwick's a great public servant, and the Republicans demonized 
him. Republicans have cynically prevented America's seniors from having 
the benefit of Dr. Berwick's vision and experience, and they ought to 
be ashamed of themselves.
  We will do the Affordable Care Act in spite of the fact that Dr. 
Berwick is gone.

                      OPPOSE THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET

  (Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I'm troubled by the Republican budget's 
effect on health care, specifically the provisions that would eliminate 
the Affordable Care Act. Passing the Republican budget would be 
detrimental to the health of citizens across the United States, but 
it's particularly harmful to women.
  As we mark the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, we can measure 
its successes by the benefits that women have already realized: 
preventive care is guaranteed, gender rating will soon be gone, and 
access to contraceptives has expanded. This expansion is important for 
all women, not just those women who use contraceptives for birth 
control.
  My colleagues will share stories of women who have been put at risk 
by this budget. I would like to share the story of Julie, an Oregonian 
whose contraceptives are important to her health on a daily basis to 
treat endometriosis. Without contraceptives, Julie would suffer from 
extreme pain and the risk of infertility. Under the Republican budget, 
her access to this medication could be in jeopardy.
  It is unconscionable to deny women access to treatments that can 
improve the quality of their lives, and I urge my colleagues to stand 
up for women and oppose the Republican budget.

                                MEDICARE

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, this past Tuesday, 41 House Republicans 
sent a letter to President Obama pleading with him to stop the 
criticism of the GOP's plan to turn Medicare into a private voucher 
system--a system that would cost future seniors thousands of dollars 
each year. Let bygones be bygones, these Republicans said. Let's wipe 
the slate clean. Well, I can't help but laugh at the irony.
  Last year, in districts all throughout the country, Republican 
candidates for Congress attacked Democrats for supporting the 
Affordable Care Act, claiming it cut $500 billion from Medicare--
wrongly, I might add.
  Fast forward 1 year later, and those same Republicans now in Congress 
just a few weeks ago voted for a budget that actually embraces the very 
same $500 billion in savings we found in Medicare in the Affordable 
Care Act.
  There's a difference, though. In the health care law, Democrats took 
that $500 billion and reinvested it in Medicare to increase the life of 
the program for more than a decade. What did the Republicans do? They 
take that $500 billion and use it to pay for more tax cuts for the 
wealthiest Americans and giant oil companies. And Medicare? They 
dismantle it, forcing future seniors into a new system that will 
require them to pay upwards of $180,000 more for their care.
  The American people will not let them forget.

                       DO NOT TURN THE CLOCK BACK

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Madam Speaker, it's been about 236 years since we 
declared independence, but it's only been 92 years since women could 
vote. We have fought for equality, fighting our way from being second-
class citizens. One such battle is the discrimination in health care.
  For so long, insurance companies have denied coverage for preexisting 
conditions like pregnancy, breast cancer, C-sections, and domestic 
abuse. Ninety percent of the best-selling plans charge women more. Some 
plans require women to even get a pre-authorization before they can 
seek OB GYN services.
  From 2014, that will not be the case because of the Affordable Care 
Act. But just a few months ago, efforts by Republicans were to block 
contraception. Now the attempts are to repeal the Affordable Care Act. 
This is the act that's been the great equalizer for women and children.
  Don't let them turn the clock back. We should not have to do another 
hundred years of battle for equality.

                        PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES

  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill's constitutional 
authority statement cites the Tenth Amendment, and as such fails to 
live up to the rule of the House, and tries to perpetuate the false 
myth that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.
  Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has heard the case. They have made 
their decision. The Affordable Care Act is constitutional. And Speaker 
Boehner has said, it is the law of the land. The constitutional 
authority statement for this bill is completely inaccurate.
  It is the 37th time we are voting to repeal or defund the Affordable 
Care Act, but apparently we still can't get the paperwork right. How 
does a Member correct the statement of constitutional authority?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not been recognized to 
engage in debate.
  Does the gentleman have a parliamentary inquiry?
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. POLIS. Has the House ever voted to repeal in whole or in part 
another piece of legislation 37 times, like we are doing here today--in 
this case, a piece of legislation that makes it illegal for insurance 
companies to discriminate against a woman if she becomes pregnant and 
makes sure that children under the age of 26 can stay on their parents' 
health care plan?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a proper 
parliamentary inquiry, and the Chair does not place proceedings in a 
historical context.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. POLIS. Is it correct that the House Republican budget maintains 
$1.2 trillion of tax increases included in the Affordable Care Act and 
$716 billion in cuts of Medicare; and, in fact, this very budget that 
we operate under would not have balanced without including these 
savings in taxes from ObamaCare?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's parliamentary inquiry is not 
relevant to any business pending before the House.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. POLIS. Is the House here this week spending millions of dollars 
of taxpayer money to repeal the Affordable Care Act because it actually 
believes that that will occur while Barack Obama is in the White House 
or because freshman Republicans want to score political points back 
home?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair does not respond to political 
commentary under the guise of parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. POLIS. I trust the American people will respond to these 
questions.

             KEEP THE IRS OFF YOUR HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2013

  Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 322, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 2009) to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from 
enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health 
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and ask for its 
immediate consideration.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 322, the bill 
is considered read.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 2009

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the IRS Off Your Health 
     Care Act of 2013''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) On May 10, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service admitted 
     that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, 
     seeking tax-exempt status.
       (2) This action raises pertinent questions about the 
     agency's ability to implement and oversee Public Law 111-148 
     and Public Law 111-152.
       (3) This action could be an indication of future Internal 
     Revenue Service abuses in relation to Public Law 111-148 and 
     Public Law 111-152 given that it is their responsibility to 
     enforce a key provision, the individual mandate.
       (4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, 
     and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the 
     Federal Government.

     SEC. 3. PROHIBITING ENFORCEMENT OF PPACA AND HCERA.

       The Secretary of the Treasury, or any delegate of the 
     Secretary, shall not implement or enforce any provisions of 
     or amendments made by Public Law 111-148 or 111-152.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Camp) and 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Camp).


                             General Leave

  Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 
5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 2009.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Michigan?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I come to the floor today in support of H.R. 2009, legislation that 
will prevent the IRS from getting involved in Americans' health care.
  The IRS is already out of control, abusing its power to tax and to 
audit the activities of honest, hardworking Americans. The IRS has 
betrayed the trust of the American people. Yet ObamaCare granted the 
IRS 47 new powers, including giving confidential taxpayer information 
to other departments and applying new taxes and penalties. Well before 
the IRS started getting involved in your health care and sharing your 
information and forcing people to pay even more taxes, let's first look 
at the job the IRS is already doing.
  Back in 2011, I investigated claims that the IRS was threatening with 
higher taxes donors to conservative causes. It turned out to be true. 
The IRS was abusing its authority, and it was harassing conservatives; 
but that was just the tip of the iceberg. We soon learned of more 
accusations about how the IRS was targeting Americans for their 
political beliefs. What we have found so far--and we just have 3 
percent of the documents from the IRS that we have requested--is that 
the IRS did leak confidential taxpayer information, that they did delay 
applications of groups supporting conservative causes, and that they 
did threaten conservatives with higher taxes.
  And Democrats want to give this agency more power and authority? They 
want this agency involved in Americans' health care? No way.
  Even the agency's own watchdog says the IRS cannot handle the job. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, the independent Treasury Inspector General 
stated that they are not confident about the IRS's ability to protect 
confidential taxpayer information or to prevent fraud. Well, neither am 
I; and by every indication, neither are the American people.
  It has been 3 years since the health care law was passed, and in less 
than 2 months, the administration claims it will be fully ready to 
implement the law; but in the face of all of these failures, of all of 
these breaches of the public trust, more Americans than ever want this 
law to be repealed.
  Why? It's simple: ObamaCare has brought increased health care costs 
to families and individuals; it has stifled businesses from expanding; 
and it has forced American job creators to cut jobs, wages, and hours.
  Just yesterday, at a hearing in the Ways and Means Committee, a key 
official from Health and Human Services could not confirm that the 
health care law would lower the health care costs for hardworking 
families in my home State of Michigan.
  But wasn't this the signature promise of this administration, that 
premiums would be $2,500 lower? And now the administration cannot make 
good on that promise.
  With so little time before the exchanges are set to open and for 
families

[[Page H5363]]

to plan their health care spending for next year, it is extremely 
concerning that the administration cannot tell the American people what 
their health insurance will look like or what it will cost. Simply put, 
this law is a failure and ought to be repealed, but it didn't have to 
be this way.
  The House Republican alternative to the Democrats' health care law, 
which I authored, was the only legislation scored by the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office as meeting the top health priority of 
American families because it was the only bill that actually lowered 
the cost of health insurance premiums, and it didn't give the IRS a 
single new power. It kept the IRS out of your health care, which is 
exactly what this bill will do--keep the IRS off and out of your health 
care.
  We should be cutting the IRS, not expanding it. We should reduce its 
power and authority and its ability to harass and abuse Americans. 
That's exactly what this bill does. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting ``yes'' on this legislation.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  We are now 7 months into this House Republican session. It has been 
nothing more than a bridge to nowhere. Nowhere on jobs. Nowhere on 
immigration reform. Nowhere on a budget agreement. Nowhere on most 
appropriations bills.
  Instead, House Republicans today continue their obsession--so vividly 
embraced by the chairman of our committee in his words--with trying to 
destroy the bridge built by the President and the Democratic Congress 
to somewhere vital--putting all Americans in charge of their own health 
care.
  This bill before us is nothing more than a continuation of the 
Republicans' blind obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act. 
This is how Republicans have chosen to spend the last day here before 
they recess this House for 5 weeks.
  It's so clear. The Republican mission is to destroy, not implement, 
health care reform. Rather than help leading on the issue, House 
Republicans have spent the last 2-plus years trying to mislead 
Americans about health care rights under the ACA. Now we can expect 
more misinformation, and the statement of our chairman is loaded with 
it.
  Thirteen States, for example, published preliminary premiums for 
marketplace coverage. Within those States, Americans will be able to 
purchase insurance at a price that is, on average, 20 percent below 
what the CBO estimated; and in Michigan, there will be 14 insurance 
carriers in the marketplace--and someone comes up here and says health 
care reform is failing.
  So, to the American people, be prepared for more scare tactics and 
other misguided efforts from Republicans to convince constituents that 
applying for health care coverage will be time-consuming and 
cumbersome, and be prepared for all kinds of misstatements about the 
powers and the role of the IRS.
  This should be said categorically. Neither the IRS nor the Department 
of Health and Human Services will have access to medical records or 
other personal history--no access whatsoever.
  Five weeks of recess await Republicans when they adjourn this House 
today. I hope when they return they will at last turn their attention 
to the pressing economic issues that Americans expect the Congress to 
address.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CAMP. At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Price, a distinguished member of the Ways 
and Means Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. Price) control the remainder of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Georgia will control the time?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I want to commend the chairman for his work on 
this and in so many vital areas of the issue of health care on our 
committee, and I want to thank him for the time and the opportunity to 
bring this bill forward.
  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans' goal in health care is to make certain 
that we have the highest quality health care in the world. That's our 
desire. We simply want it to be patient-centered health care, not 
government-centered health care. We believe that patients and families 
and doctors ought to be making medical decisions, not Washington, D.C. 
So this bill, H.R. 2009, grows out of the IRS's activities that have 
come to light in this country over the past number of months. As the 
chairman mentioned, we've been doing a lot of oversight hearings in our 
committee.
  The American people have drawn a conclusion about the IRS at this 
point, and that conclusion is that it cannot be trusted now. The 
chairman mentioned that the IRS has targeted groups that have come to 
the IRS asking for a tax-exempt status. It has targeted groups for 
their political ideology. The IRS has leaked donor information to those 
groups, and many of us believe--and I think it will come out--that the 
IRS has, in fact, targeted donors to those groups for audits to those 
individual Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, this is chilling activity from the Internal Revenue 
Service, so the American people have lost their faith and trust in the 
Internal Revenue Service. That's why this bill is so important.
  This is a very simple piece of legislation--two pages, in fact. All 
it says, simply, is what the American people believe, and that is that 
the IRS should not be charged and have the authority to either 
implement or enforce the Affordable Care Act. I want to commend over 
140 Members from this House of Representatives for being cosponsors, 
and we have hundreds of citizen cosponsors from across the country.
  Some say that this isn't necessary, that it is not going to 
accomplish anything, that there is no reason the IRS would want that 
information anyway. The fact of the matter is that that's exactly what 
they said about what they did for the tax-exempt groups. They said, 
Well, it wasn't necessary for them to get that information about 
political ideology or beliefs or prayers that prayer groups were 
offering. That wasn't necessary either.
  So, if that were not necessary, Mr. Speaker, how can the American 
people have faith and confidence that the IRS won't do something that 
also is unnecessary, and that is to engage in implementing themselves 
into that trusted relationship between patients and physicians?

                              {time}  1045

  Then another piece of evidence, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest is the 
individual who's running the IRS division that is charged with the 
enforcement of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Speaker, that individual is 
Sarah Hall Ingram. You don't have to look too far back in her biography 
to recognize that she was the individual who was, in fact, in charge of 
the tax exempt group in the IRS at the time when the challenges to the 
IRS had been focused.
  Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming percent of the American people 
understand and appreciate that the IRS should not be involved in the 
health care of this Nation. We believe patients and families and 
doctors ought to be making medical decisions, not Washington, D.C., and 
certainly not the Internal Revenue Service.
  I reserve the balance of my time
  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
McDermott), another member of the committee.
  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.)
  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I would remind my distinguished colleague 
from Georgia of a story in the Bible about a king who was very famous 
and one day noticed on the wall some writing. He had someone come in 
and interpret for him, and the writing said: ``Your days are numbered 
upon the Earth.''
  Your days are numbered on this issue. You have 59 more days. I'm sure 
you can bring up a bill every single day to try and repeal it. The 
Speaker has announced there will be two more, but it will not work. 
This is going to be the law on 1 October, and it's going to go into 
effect. The Supreme Court has spoken. The Speaker has actually said, 
``It's the law of the land.'' Yet we see this hopeless strategy--it's 
worse than hopeless. It's weak and it's mean. What you're saying is you 
want to take away

[[Page H5364]]

from people what they already have, guaranteed issue, coverage for 
their kids to age 26, and lifetime limits will be gone. All of that you 
want to take away.
  Have a great break, because you're going to go back to your districts 
and explain for 38 days why you will not provide health care coverage 
for the people of America. I hear there's a mythical bill with 141 
signatures. The Republicans have been running the Ways and Means 
Committee for 16 out of the last 18 years, and we have never had a bill 
put in front of us for a vote. It's never been through the Rules 
Committee. It's never been out to the floor.
  You have no plan. You have a piece of paper that you wave around, but 
you won't go out and defend it. The President came and put a bill out 
here, and we passed it, and we're defending it, and it's going to go 
into effect and provide what all Americans want: security if they get 
sick; they want to know they'll be covered; they want to know they 
won't be bankrupted.
  Vote ``no'' again today, and we'll be back after the break for a few 
more ``no'' votes.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record a letter 
from The Seniors Coalition in support of H.R. 2009.

                                        The Seniors Coalition,

                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2013.
     Hon. Dr. Tom Price,
     Cannon House Office Building,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Congressman Price: I am writing to you today on behalf 
     of the over four million members and supporters of The 
     Seniors Coalition in support of your bill H.R. 2009, ``The 
     Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act.'' The Seniors 
     Coalition was originally founded as a public advocacy group 
     fighting to repeal the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act. 
     Since 1990, TSC has grown rapidly and expanded its advocacy 
     to include any issue that concerns America's senior citizens. 
     Today the Coalition is one of the largest grassroots advocacy 
     organizations in Washington, D.C. in terms of number of 
     supporters nationwide. TSC currently has over four million 
     supporters representing every state in the union.
       The Obama Administration, including the IRS, has betrayed 
     the trust of the American people. Allowing the IRS to enforce 
     ObamaCare is opening up the door to more abuse, more 
     targeting and more harassment of American citizens. The vast 
     majority of the American people do not support ObamaCare, and 
     President Obama is ignoring the will of the people.
       That is why The Seniors Coalition is writing today to fully 
     support H.R. 2009. Clearly, the IRS has proven itself either 
     unwilling or unable to prudently and impartially enforce the 
     law, and we certainly cannot trust them with our health care.
       Thank you for all your hard work Dr. Price, and please 
     don't hesitate to contact me directly if there is anything 
     that The Seniors Coalition and its over four million members 
     and supporters in all 50 states can do to assist you in your 
     effort to de-fund/repeal ObamaCare.
           Sincerely,
                                                    Sean Ferritor,
                                               Executive Director.

  I'm now pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Carter).
  Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for 
bringing this bill forward.
  Mr. Speaker, I'd be willing to bet if you took a poll in any 
household in America and asked, Who do you trust, the IRS or your 
doctor, doctors would overwhelmingly be trusted; the IRS would be 
overwhelmingly distrusted.
  I don't understand when we actually pass laws in this Congress 
restricting the access to health care information and putting severe 
penalties on our health care providers for releasing health care 
information and these HIPAA laws--they've been around a while now, I'd 
say--and then we write a bill that turns the entire health care system 
administration over to the one agency that the American people hate 
more than any other agency.
  Some of the Democrats like it because they like to get other people's 
money and spend it. The reality is the IRS is not trusted, and it 
wasn't trusted before the events that have been described here today. 
Today they're totally distrusted. In fact, they are totally feared 
because of what they can do to the private lives of American citizens. 
This bill speaks for the American people, and they say don't let the 
IRS get their hands on our health care. They will destroy us.
  Remember, they're the one agency that doesn't have to meet a burden 
of proof. They require the public to meet the burden of proof.
  Don't let the IRS get their hands on our health care.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.
  Saying that the entire administration of health care is turned over 
to the IRS is a big lie. The IRS will not have access to the medical 
records or personal health history of a single American.
  I now yield 2 minutes to a distinguished colleague of mine from 
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this is a fitting conclusion to a week 
that has shown the collapse of the Republican legislative agenda. 
Remember, this is the time we were supposed to be voting on budgets, 
but the Republicans cannot even bring themselves to allow a vote on the 
budget that they themselves have mandated. We're not voting on the 
Transportation-HUD; we're not voting on Interior. They refuse to allow 
a conference committee to be appointed so that we can reconcile 
differences on the budget, setting up a showdown over a shutdown of the 
government next month.
  Now we're dealing with health care for arguably the 40th time that 
they are going to ``repeal'' it. The bill is not going anywhere. They 
repeatedly demonstrated at our hearing yesterday in Ways and Means that 
my Republican colleagues don't even understand how the bill that they 
are so adamantly opposed to works.
  We have not seen any attempt to improve, to refine. What we have seen 
is an unprecedented effort to sabotage legislation, to make it not work 
for the American people, to confuse, to undercut. This is something 
that is unprecedented, to the best of my knowledge, in what we have had 
in Congress in the past. What more fitting illustration of a group 
that's bankrupt of ideas and bent on simply attempting to force their 
way for an agenda that is so extreme that they cannot agree to bring it 
to the floor to vote on it.
  I urge rejection of this charade.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I now insert into the Record a 
letter from the group Let Freedom Ring that endorses H.R. 2009.

                                             Let Freedom Ring,

                                                       July, 2013.
       Dear Friend: You have no doubt heard by now that senior 
     members of the United States Internal Revenue Service were 
     involved in a politically-motivated effort to blunt the 
     impact of the tea party movement and other organizations not 
     in sync with President Barack Obama's agenda for America.
       We don't yet know all the facts but we do know that some 
     groups had their applications for non-profit status ``slow 
     walked'' through the process, existing groups were subjected 
     to comprehensive audits, many were loaded down with intrusive 
     and inappropriate questions about the prayers of their 
     members and other activities, and that tax returns of major 
     donors and conservative operatives were audited.
       Things are so bad that one senior IRS official who appears 
     to have been involved ``took the fifth'' before a 
     congressional investigating committee.
       If that were not enough, some of the same people that look 
     to have been involved in the effort to politically harass 
     potential opponents of the president's agenda have now been 
     put in charge of expansion of the IRS's role in monitoring 
     individual and corporate compliance with Obamacare.
       Our good friend Dr. Tom Price, who represents Georgia's 6th 
     Congressional District, is taking the bull by the horns--but 
     he needs our help. He has introduced a bill--H.R. 2009--that 
     would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from implementing 
     or enforcing any provisions of the president's health care 
     law.
       Congress needs to act--now--and they need pressure from you 
     to do so. They need to get behind Dr. Price's bill before the 
     IRS can do even more damage. Will you please take a moment to 
     write to your member of Congress and your two Senators and 
     urge them to support Dr. Price's legislation? Tell them to 
     cut off funding for the expansion of the IRS for Obamacare 
     unless and until the American people have all the answers 
     about how President Obama and his subordinates politicized 
     the IRS to harass their political opponents.
       The whole business is suspicious, especially since the IRS 
     has for the last three years been denying to Congress that 
     any such activity or any activity like it was occurring. 
     Congress is now asking questions and the Obama Administration 
     has become evasive--despite a report by the IRS's own 
     inspector general that the agency had committed wrongdoing.
       The IRS can no longer be trusted to behave in a non-
     partisan manner. It should not be given extra authority until 
     it can prove once again that it will not abuse the public 
     trust.

[[Page H5365]]

       Thank you for all you do on behalf of freedom.
           Sincerely,
                                                      Colin Hanna,
                                                        President.

  I'm pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to a Member from the great State 
of Michigan, Dr. Benishek, and a fellow physician.
  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2009, the 
Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act, and urge my colleagues to 
support this necessary legislation.
  The bill will keep the Internal Revenue Service from implementing any 
aspect of the President's health care law. With the recent revelations 
that employees of the IRS targeted U.S. citizens based on their 
political views, it's imperative that we keep the IRS from being 
further involved than it already is in the lives of the American 
people.
  This legislation would repeal both the individual mandate and the 
employer mandate, while at the same time helping to shrink the IRS.
  As a doctor, I've been taking care of patients for the last 30 years. 
I know that putting the Federal Government between patients and doctors 
will be disastrous. Many families in northern Michigan agree, and they 
want to see this law repealed. This legislation is a good step toward 
rolling back this massive expansion of Federal Government power.
  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of it.
  Mr. LEVIN. It's now a special pleasure for me to yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman who presided over the passage of 
Medicare 48 years ago and has worked on health care issues his entire 
historic career, Mr. Dingell from the State of Michigan.
  (Mr. DINGELL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. DINGELL. I thank my beloved friend for yielding me this time, Mr. 
Speaker.
  I rise to ask: Aren't you embarrassed to go a 40th time in a 
fruitless, hopeless act? This is the 40th time we've tried to kill the 
legislation. It costs us $1.5 million every time, none of which have 
been successful.
  My Republican colleagues have never come forward with a proposal 
which they have presented to this House, but they sit over there 
railing and complaining about what is going on. They're going to take 
the rights of the American people for protection against pre-existing 
condition, bans on their insurance. They're going to take away from the 
American people all kinds of protections which we have in the 
Affordable Care Act.
  The Speaker the other day said the Republicans were the party of 
repeal. I think he's right. I suspect we don't want to call them the 
Republicans anymore, but I think we ought to call them the 
``Repealicans'' or perhaps the ``Repealican'ts,'' because they've never 
been able to repeal anything, and they can't enact legislation.
  There have been 12 bills, I think, that this Congress has sent to the 
White House, and there is small prospect of anything more coming from 
here. It's interesting to note they can't move a budget; they can't do 
legislation on jobs; they're incapable of seeing to it that we do the 
other things that are necessary to help the middle class. Yet we keep 
coming over here with nonsense like this.
  The Republican Party is like the Bourbons of France: they forget 
nothing because they never learned anything.
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I now insert into the Record a 
letter from the group Americans for Prosperity which endorses H.R. 
2009.

                                     Americans for Prosperity,

                                     Arlington, VA, July 15, 2013.
       Dear Representative Price: On behalf of more than two 
     million Americans for Prosperity activists in all 50 states, 
     I applaud you for introducing the Keep the IRS Off Your 
     Health Care Act (H.R. 2009), which would prohibit the 
     Internal Revenue Service from implementing the President's 
     health care law.
       The health care law grants the IRS an alarming expansion of 
     new power, essentially granting the agency the authority to 
     oversee every American's health insurance decisions. The IRS 
     will be responsible for enforcing the health insurance 
     mandates on individuals and employers, collecting the 21 new 
     taxes created in the law, and cross-referencing individuals' 
     health insurance exchange applications with IRS records.
       AFP is deeply concerned that all Americans will now be 
     asked to turn over the private health insurance information 
     about their children and families to a disgraced organization 
     that has admitted to abusing its power and processing 
     applications in a biased, political manner. How can the 
     American people trust that the IRS won't also target American 
     citizens who disagree with the President when enforcing the 
     health care law?
       Your legislation also affirms the common-sense principle 
     that control over health care decisions should remain between 
     American families and their doctors, not Washington 
     bureaucrats like the IRS. Americans for Prosperity is proud 
     to support H.R. 2009, your legislation to prohibit the IRS 
     from enforcing provisions of the health care law. I urge your 
     colleagues to support its passage, and I look forward to 
     working with you in the future.
           Sincerely,
                                          Christine Harbin Hanson,
                         Policy Analyst, Americans for Prosperity.

  Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Culberson), a gentleman who's a member of the 
Appropriations Committee, a fellow who has led on this issue for his 
entire career.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much the gentleman from 
Georgia filing this important legislation. I feel my day is not 
complete if we don't get a chance to vote to cut spending and abolish 
ObamaCare.
  We were sent here by our constituents to protect the Treasury and do 
everything we can to keep the government out of their lives and out of 
their pockets. Yet ObamaCare contains more than 20 tax increases and 
gives the IRS unprecedented authority to collect personal health 
information from more than 300 million Americans.
  ObamaCare requires all insurance companies to report to the IRS the 
name, address, identification number, and type of insurance policy 
purchased by every customer, along with a determination of whether or 
not the insurance was ``government approved.''
  I'm very proud to be a co-author of Dr. Price's legislation that will 
prohibit the IRS from collecting our personal health care information. 
The IRS has proven they cannot be trusted by targeting organizations 
based on their political affiliation. Since the IRS has admitted this, 
I've heard from so many constituents who are members of patriotic 
organizations. They've stepped up for the first time in their lives to 
get involved in politics and organizations like the Texas Tea Party, 
the Katy Tea Party, and the King Street Patriots. For standing up as 
patriots and trying to do the right thing for the right reasons, they 
were targeted by the IRS and harassed.
  Today the IRS is spending 80 percent of its budget trying to 
implement ObamaCare, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew recently testified 
the IRS has approximately 700 full-time staff working on ObamaCare 
implementation. Now the IRS wants to hire an additional 2,000 
bureaucrats to continue to implement ObamaCare.
  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
  Mr. LEVIN. I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. Andrews), who has been a leader on this issue.
  (Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)

                              {time}  1100

  Mr. ANDREWS. Colleagues, somewhere in America today a family is going 
to get the devastating news you all dread about your children: they're 
going to hear that that lump in their daughter's stomach is cancer. And 
they're going to go home and they're going to have all the agony and 
they're going to have all of the unthinkable thoughts that parents are 
going to have in that situation, but they are going to be faced with 
another problem because they have no health insurance. Both the mom and 
the dad work. They make about $40,000 a year between the two of them. 
They don't get coverage at work, and they can't .."

[Page H4766]
                        VOTE AGAINST THE REPEAL

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, we have just finished part 
of the debate for legislation that wants to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act. I rise today as we conclude and begin to look toward the 
conclusion of the debate tomorrow to make a public appeal.
  When the 1965 Medicare law was written, it was written to save lives. 
We have statistics that recognize that prior to Medicare, Americans 
were living 60 years and under. It is well documented that we've 
extended the lives of senior citizens through Medicare. Now the 
Affordable Care Act seeks to extend the lives of the sickest of the 
sick, to extend the lives of children with preexisting diseases, to 
extend the lives of individuals who would not have access to insurance, 
or those families who have been thrown into poverty because of 
catastrophic illnesses or an accident. We can do better.
  This bill is a promise of allowing and providing for all Americans to 
be insured. This bill cries out for Republicans and Democrats to work 
together. This bill cries out for saving the lives of Americans who 
have been falling along the highway of despair and dying.
  It is important for us to look for the common and better good, the 
public good. Save this bill. Vote against the repeal.

                          ____________________

                        THE SUPREME COURT RULING

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I'm proud of 
the decision of the United States Supreme Court today. I was proud to 
serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee that actually drafted this 
bill. I read it many times, and I actually had a lot of amendments.
  The Affordable Care Act has already benefited millions of Americans 
and will continue to help those who are in the greatest of need--
children, young adults, people with preexisting conditions, and our 
seniors. In my own congressional district in Texas, this is 
particularly important because we have one of the highest rates of 
uninsured individuals in the country.
  Our Constitution gives the U.S. Supreme Court the job to be the 
decider on what is constitutional. The Affordable Care Act is 
constitutional. Just like Social Security and Medicare, now it's the 
law of this great Nation.

[Page H42]
           By Mr. GARRETT:
       H.R. 21.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       This bill seeks to strike a provision from the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act, the so-called 
     ``individual mandate,'' which is unconstitutional.
       The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires 
     individuals to purchase private health insurance--health 
     insurance that has been approved by the federal government--
     or pay a fine. While Congress is granted the authority to 
     ``regulate commerce . . . among the several states,'' and the 
     Supreme Court has allowed Congress to regulate and prohibit 
     ``economic'' activities that are not, strictly speaking, 
     commerce, this is the first time in our nation's history that 
     Congress has sought to regulate inactivity. And for the first 
     time, Congress has mandated that individuals purchase a 
     private good, approved by the government, as the price of 
     citizenship. This requirement is plainly unconstitutional, 
     and, as Federal District Court Judge Henry Hudson recently 
     wrote in his opinion striking down the individual mandate, 
     ``is beyond the historical reach of the Commerce Clause.''

                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, March 6, 2014

  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I want to state for the record that on 
Wednesday, March 5, 2014, I unfortunately missed rollcall votes as I 
traveled to New Britain, CT, with President Barack Obama on official 
business.
  Had I been present I would have voted:
  ``No'' on the Previous Question (roll #93). Had a majority of the 
House voted no, this bill would have allowed a vote to renew the 
emergency unemployment insurance to help over 35,000 jobseekers in 
Connecticut;
  ``No'' on H. Res. 497 (roll #94), which prevented any amendments to 
H.R. 4118 from being considered;
  ``Aye'' on H.R. 938, the U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act (roll 
#95), which I proudly cosponsored;
  ``Aye'' on the Motion to Recommit H.R. 4118 (roll #96) to prevent 
H.R. 4118 from altering, weakening, or delaying the ACA's prohibition 
of discrimination based on pre-existing conditions or gender and tax 
credits and rebates;
  ``No'' on H.R. 4118 (roll #97). Back in July of last year, I was 
concerned that the federal marketplace would not be ready for the 
October 1, 2013, start date for enrollment under the Affordable Care 
Act. And, in fact, as we saw last fall, the federal website was not 
ready to handle the volume from states that didn't set up their own 
exchange. The website problems were unacceptable. Based on the 
situation that I saw eight months ago, I believed that giving folks an 
extra year to learn about the benefits and responsibilities under the 
new law without penalty was a reasonable modification, particularly 
with misinformation spread about the Affordable Care Act and the 
uncertainty about the readiness of the marketplace.
  I believe that my job is to solve problems and vote based on actual 
facts in my state and district, not ideology. And the facts in 
Connecticut in March 2014 are quite different than they were in July 
2013. The exchanges have been up and running for five full months, and 
Connecticut is leading the way. With less than one month left in the 
enrollment period, over 130,000 people in Connecticut have signed up 
for health coverage through Access Health CT, exceeding the state and 
federal government's goals. Now is not the time to retroactively delay 
the individual mandate. As I've previously stated, the individual 
mandate, upheld by the Supreme Court, is a critical part of the 
Affordable Care Act. Since July 2013, I've held workshops for small 
businesses and individuals to learn more about the Affordable Care Act 
and how to sign up for health insurance. I've heard stories from 
constituents about how the Affordable Care Act has helped them access 
affordable, quality health care. A woman from Canaan, a breast cancer 
survivor, is now saving over $1,500 on her monthly premium; a former 
small business owner in New Britain can afford health insurance for the 
first time in 12 years.
  The law is not perfect, and improvements can, should, and have been 
made. I will continue to raise concerns I've heard from folks in my 
district and to work with the Obama Administration to fix problems as 
they arise. But there is no question that the responsible course of 
action is to continue to move forward;
  ``Aye'' on H.R. 2126, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act (roll 
#98), which was a bipartisan bill to expand energy efficiency 
standards.

[Page H6058]
    THIS IS A SAD DAY FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day for the American people and 
for American democracy.
  For weeks, I've told my constituents that I know things look bad, but 
the Republicans won't shut down the government. There's too many adults 
on that side of the room to let this happen.
  And now, after watching what happened yesterday, I can barely explain 
this to myself. The best I can say is I feel like I'm serving in the 
Nation's largest kindergarten, only we're in charge of the Federal 
checkbook and the nuclear arsenal.
  The fact that so many Republicans are holding their breath because 
they don't like the Affordable Care Act--Congress passed the Affordable 
Care Act. The President signed the bill into law. The Supreme Court has 
upheld the law.
  And yet this body keeps voting to try and repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, not just once or twice, getting the message, but 46 times. And 
it's still operational today.
  What happened last night, in the final half hour before closing down 
our government?
  The Republicans came up with a last-ditch effort: let's go to 
conference committee.
  I serve on the Budget Committee. We have been asking, for 6 months, 
to have the Republicans appoint conferees so we could have a budget in 
this country. The only obstacle between this country having a budget 
and not is the fact that the Speaker would refuse to appoint conferees 
to a budget.
  Last night, with 15 minutes to spare, the best idea the Republicans 
have, after 46 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is to have us 
go to a conference committee.
  What are the results of what happened?
  Well, one, government is shut down. Thank you, Republican Party.
  Two, the Affordable Care Act is implementing today and is the law of 
the land.
  And, three, I'm guessing the Tea Party had a pretty good fundraising 
week or two.
  But here's what happens to the people in my district. People who are 
trying to get small business loans from the Small Business 
Administration are going to be halted; $1 billion a month that happens 
is halted right now, so we can't grow the economy.
  People trying to get housing loans for rural families and low- and 
middle-income families are going to be put on hold.
  The Women, Infant and Children program for low-income, pregnant women 
will be put on hold, after this Congress has already tried to cut $39 
billion from food stamps.
  We're going to block the Centers for Disease Control from tracking 
influenza, something that could potentially have devastating impact 
across the country.
  And more than 800,000 Federal employees are going to be furloughed 
because some Republicans couldn't get their way on the 46th try.
  I served in the Wisconsin legislature for 14 years before coming 
here, and we had our differences, but we always moved on. We did our 
jobs.
  Now it's time for Congress to do our job. It doesn't matter what 
party you belong to. America deserves better.
  The adults in the Republican Party need to take the keys back from 
the Tea Party before they have to call a tow truck to take the country 
out of the ditch. It's time for the country to act, and we need the 
Republicans to get behind something that gets a budget done.

                           TEXT OF AMENDMENTS

  SA 3553. Mr. VITTER submitted an amendment which was ordered to lie 
on the table; as follows:

       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

                         HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Griffin) is 
recognized for the remainder of the time until 10 p.m. as the designee 
of the majority leader.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a little time 
tonight with my colleague, Representative Young from Indiana, to talk a 
little bit about health care in America, talk a little bit about the 
Affordable Care Act that is currently being implemented, and talk about 
the need for real health care reform in this country.
  I want to start out by just emphasizing that I firmly believe we need 
health care reform. I believe that the health care reform we got in the 
form of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, is not the health care 
reform that we need. And I would say that we have lots of proposals 
here in the House. I think last Congress we had over 200 bills 
introduced that related to the health care system, reforming our health 
care system. And this Congress, we have dozens of health care reform 
related bills as well.
  So the idea that it's either the Affordable Care Act as we're seeing 
it unfold, or nothing at all, it's a false choice. That's not the 
choice that we have. There are lots of ideas; lots of much better 
ideas, I must add. And while I am personally for repeal--I certainly 
want the Affordable Care Act repealed--I want to replace it with 
quality, patient-centered health care reform.
  I am not against providing relief to Americans who are feeling the 
burden of the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare right now. In fact, we 
had a hearing on the implementation of the ObamaCare law in the Ways 
and Means Committee today, a committee of which I am a member. And my 
colleague Representative Young is also a member. And we heard a lot of 
people say hey, this is the law of the land, don't mess with it. This 
is the law of the land, let it go. This is the law of the land, any 
attempt to criticize it, to discuss its shortcomings, is a waste of 
time.
  Well, I reject that outright. And, you know, I think the President, 
through his actions, has rejected that.
  What am I talking about? Well, it's interesting because we've passed 
seven bills in this House, seven bills, that relate to ObamaCare, 
changing ObamaCare, repealing a part of ObamaCare, seven that not only 
passed this House, we sent them to the other side of the Capitol. They 
passed the Senate. And you know what? The President signed them into 
law. That may come as a surprise to some folks, but it's the truth. We 
passed seven bills to change, to modify, to repeal parts of, to make 
better ObamaCare, and the President has agreed with us on all seven. He 
signed them into law.

  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Are these some of the very same bills, my good 
colleague, that the President in recent speeches has characterized as 
partisan, misguided, meaningless? I do believe you may be referring to 
some of those bills.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Those are the same bills, and I would like 
to go through, if I can, the seven bills, and talk a little bit about 
what they do and how they were an improvement. I think they are 
evidence that yes, we'd like to replace this bill with something much 
better, this law, but in the short term, we will do whatever it takes 
to provide relief to American workers, relief to American families, 
relief to small businesses that are under the burden of ObamaCare.
  So let me mention a few of these.
  H.R. 4: H.R. 4 repealed the small business paperwork 1099 mandate. I 
remember when I first got to Congress, I heard from a bunch of folks 
about the 1099 filing obligation under the President's health care law. 
We repealed that. You know what the President did? He agreed. Bad part 
of the law.
  Next, H.R. 1473. We cut $2.2 billion from what was characterized as a 
stealth public plan, a consumer-operated and -oriented plan, and froze 
the IRS budget. The President signed that into law.
  Next, H.R. 674. We saved taxpayers $13 billion by adjusting the 
eligibility for ObamaCare programs. The President signed that into law.
  H.R. 2055 made more reductions to the consumer-operated and -oriented 
plan that I mentioned earlier, also to the IPAB, the Independent 
Payment Advisory Board, an independent board that's going to cut 
Medicare, because it hasn't been reformed, when it runs out of money. 
So that was signed into law. And again in today's hearing in the Ways 
and Means Committee, folks on the other side of the aisle were saying 
this talk, this criticism about the President's law, ObamaCare, a waste 
of time, meaningless, all politics. Hogwash; the President signed a 
bunch of it into law.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Well, it is hogwash. And it's particularly 
hogwash because among those various reforms that you've itemized there, 
let's reflect on how much persuasion, how much public argument was 
required to even bring the President of the United States to go along 
with repealing this egregious, superfluous 1099 obligation.

[[Page H5333]]

We had to make the public argument. We had to win the argument because 
there was great reluctance, if recollection serves, and I think it 
does, to make any changes whatsoever to what most Americans now know as 
ObamaCare.
  The thought was and the thinking still seems to be among a number of 
our colleagues that if they touch the act, then that is going to lead 
to further reform, perhaps dissolution or repeal of the act altogether 
and replacement with something that is more patient centered, with 
something, frankly, that is more bipartisan.
  So to our colleagues who often level criticisms at those of us who 
are identifying ways to alleviate the pain on the American people with 
respect to this law, the so-called Affordable Care Act, I think it 
bears reminding the importance of continuing the argument, forcefully 
making the argument about all the pain that it is causing.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Precisely. And a lot of people ask, why all 
the focus, why all the energy, why all the speeches? Because it's 
important, number one. And, number two, it takes the energy, the focus, 
the time, the prioritization, the resources, to convince people, the 
President included, that this is not the way to go.
  Now, I think if you were to throw these seven different bills out 
there a few years ago when ObamaCare passed and say, hey, what are the 
chances of the President signing this? People would have said no way. 
No way it's going to happen. So it's a process. It's a process of 
making the argument with facts; not through personal attack, with 
facts. Make the vigorous argument. That's what this body and democracy 
is about, make the argument, win the argument, and then repeal or 
change.
  And I would mention, there are three more: H.R. 3630 slashed billions 
of dollars from some discretionary funds, some slush funds which they 
had some flexibility to use, and the President agreed with that. He 
signed that into law.
  H.R. 4348 adjusted a drafting error. It saved $670 million.
  And H.R. 8 repealed what was called the CLASS program--Community 
Living Assistance Services and Support program. The former Democratic 
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee called the CLASS program ``a 
Ponzi scheme of the first order, the kind of thing Bernie Madoff would 
be proud of.''
  We saved billions of dollars through the repeal of H.R. 8. So to 
reiterate, there are seven bills we fought hard for, and every single 
one of them ultimately was signed into law by the President of the 
United States.
  Now, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the biggest change, 
the most consequential change to ObamaCare, the most open and full 
recognition that the President's health care law is unworkable and 
problematic and a burden is the fact that the President himself just a 
few weeks ago on July 2, through a blog post, a Department of Treasury 
blog post, said, you know what? I am going to suspend, postpone for a 
year the so-called employer mandate that is one of the key pillars of 
the ObamaCare law.

                              {time}  2115

  Now, what is that mandate?
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Well, the mandate is that every employer across 
the United States of America who employs 50 or more persons on a full-
time basis must provide government-sanctioned, government-approved 
health insurance to their employees.
  Now, look, superficially, that sounds just great. There's some 
problems here. First, this law redefines full-time in a way that 
Americans have never understood
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. If you were to ask me what does full-time 
mean to you, I'd say, growing up in south Arkansas, full-time means 40 
hours in a week or more, right?
  That's a commonsense, practical application of what full-time is.
  Would that be right under ObamaCare?
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. That's what most Hoosiers think as well.
  I think I've traveled quite a bit, gotten to know people around the 
country. And I don't believe I've encountered, I reckon, anyone who 
thought that full-time was 30 hours. So where did this come from? Out 
of thin air, presumably.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. So the bottom line is the President 
recognized--and I applaud him for this--I applaud him for recognizing 
the problem, the burden of his law, particularly the employer mandate. 
And he said, I'm going to postpone that part of the law. I'm basically 
going to repeal, in effect, repeal that for a year; just make that go 
away for a year as a practical matter.
  Now, I applaud his recognition that the law has problems. The problem 
I had with that action is I don't think, still do not believe the 
President had the power to do that. If he wants the law changed, he 
should have called Congress. We would have been more than happy to 
deliver up a bill--send it over to the Senate--that postponed the 
employer mandate a year.
  In fact, because of the President doing that, that's precisely what 
we did. So I introduced H.R. 2667, that does that in legislation, not 
through a regulatory change, a blog post. But I introduced the 
Authority for Mandate Delay Act, which we voted on. We passed on this 
floor.
  Why?
  It does the same basic thing, a little bit different, but the same 
basic thing that the President was doing, and we did it so that what he 
did would be legal. And you know what? Thirty-five Democrats supported 
this bill. Thirty-five Democrats supported this bill, and I applaud 
them for doing it.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Potentially, you, myself and so many other 
Members of this body agreed with the substance of the President's blog 
post, though one would question whether we were intended to be a Nation 
of laws or instead a Nation of blog posts. We could get into that 
separate conversation.
  I think fair-minded people agreed that the delay was appropriate. 
ObamaCare is not ready for prime time. The computer systems don't seem 
to be ready. Employers are confused about exactly how this law's going 
to work, exactly how it's going to impact them. Employees are confused. 
And something had to be done.
  But I think that recognition that something had to be done only 
occurred because there were people in Congress making arguments, as 
they continue to make arguments, with respect to the flaws in this 
legislation.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. And I would add to that there are many of us 
that believe the reason this law is not working is because it will 
never work. It is unworkable by design. It is top-down. It is the old 
way of doing things in a world that is becoming network bottom-up, 
innovative, new way of doing things. This is an old central control, 
top-down way of legislating.
  And so the President recognized that. But, of course, for partisan 
politics reasons, even though my bill did basically what he did, he 
opposed it. He opposed the bill that would have made his actions legal.
  And, of course, now it is sitting, napping, because we hope to awake 
it, it's napping in the Senate, in the United States Senate, with your 
companion bill, the Individual Mandate Delay.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Well, kudos to the one of, what is it, six 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle that joined us in voting for 
your bill.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Thirty-five Democrats.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Thirty-five in total?
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. That's right.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. I think one out of every six members of their 
conference were supportive of your bill.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. That's exactly right.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. I think that was the right thing to do, the 
right vote to cast. It certainly preserved the precedent that it is 
this body that passes the laws, that develops the legislation.
  It's the job of the executive branch to sign those various acts into 
law, and then to execute them, not to recraft the laws as it might see 
convenient, for whatever motives.
  And so you mentioned my bill, which is really, in the end, the 
American people's bill because it's designed to provide relief to 
American families, the Fairness for American Families Act.
  You know, the thinking behind this is quite simple. If the President 
wants

[[Page H5334]]

to offer businesses a relief from the employer mandate tax, as our 
Supreme Court has styled it, then why won't you offer relief to working 
Americans and their families?
  It's that simple. And I have yet to hear an acceptable response. No, 
we're playing politics.
  Well, are those one of nine Democrats who voted for my legislation 
also playing politics?
  No, candidly, I think they're being fair minded. Some would argue 
that they're looking for political cover or whatever. I'll let others 
assess that.
  But, certainly, it's good legislation. It's fair and equitable 
legislation to accord the same sort of treatment to hardworking 
Americans that the President would give to the business community.
  And though I agree, let me go on record that that business community 
needs relief too.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Well, and one in nine of the Democrats voted 
for your bill. I think it was 22 total. I think, just a year or two 
ago, that would have been unthinkable, that 35 would have joined voting 
for the Employer Mandate Delay and 22 or so for your bill. It would 
have been unthinkable.
  It is because we have been relentless in pursuit of a better way, 
relentless in pursuit of real health care reform, relentless in 
identifying and letting folks in Washington know that the people back 
home, constituents, have made their voice very clear, where I live, in 
Arkansas, on the issue of the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare.
  And what's interesting is, today, in the Ways and Means Committee, we 
had the head of the IRS testifying. And he was explaining why the 
President decided to delay, for 1 year, one of the two key components 
of the Affordable Care Act--one being the employer mandate, and the 
other part of the law being the individual mandate.
  We know that the President delayed that one, the employer mandate, 
and he was explaining why he did that. And this is a paraphrase of what 
he said.
  It's the head of the IRS describing why the President gave 1 year 
relief to businesses impacted by the employer mandate. He said, to 
paraphrase, not a direct quote, but to paraphrase, he said, in effect, 
we heard from a lot of American small businesses that this was a burden 
on them, and so we acted to give them relief. That's a paraphrase, but 
that's effectively what he said.
  I agree with the general sentiment. It is a burden on American 
workers and small businesses, et cetera, and they do need relief, and 
I'm glad they're getting it.
  But it raises the question, why wouldn't you give that same relief, 
as a matter of fairness, to individuals, families, workers impacted by 
the individual mandate, the other key component of ObamaCare, of the 
Affordable Care Act?
  Why would you give relief to small businesses and businesses and what 
have you, but not give relief to individuals?
  It fundamentally doesn't make sense. It's not fair.
  And when he said that, I thought to myself, well, is it possible that 
he doesn't know, that the head of the IRS and the administration don't 
know that individuals and families and workers are also impacted in a 
negative way, that they are burdened, many of them, by this law?
  Yes, they want health care reform. Yes, people need insurance. Yes, 
people want to be covered. But this is not the way to go.
  Does he not know the impact that this law is having?
  So I thought, why don't we put all the opinions aside, the op eds, 
the editorialists, and why don't we just talk about some of the news 
headlines?
  Without my commentary, I thought you and I could just read some of 
the headlines. These are news stories, not op eds, not editorial 
writers. These are news stories from a variety of publications from 
around the country. And I thought it would be instructive to run 
through some of those tonight.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. There seem to be a lot there. How would you 
like to proceed?
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. I tell you what, I'll read through one of 
these, and I'll put one up. You could read through, and then I'll take 
one. These are headlines from around the country. And we're going to 
run through them because they are news stories that, regardless of what 
you hear from this administration, this is what's happening around the 
country.
  The AP: Florida Insurance Officials: Rates Will Rise Under ObamaCare.
  Georgia Insurance Rates Spike Under ObamaCare.
  Now, I would point out, we don't have to guess what's going to happen 
anymore. We don't have to predict what's going to happen.
  Why? Because we're already there. Implementation is under way. It's 
already happening. So we'll just let the facts speak.
  Chattanooga Business Owner Says ObamaCare Costing Workers Pay Raises 
and Benefits.
  Consumers Could See 25-Percent Premium Increases Under ObamaCare.
  UNA Asks Student Employees to Work Fewer Hours.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. So the Contra Costa Times of Concord says that 
half of the Affordable Care Act call-center jobs will be part-time.
  The Missourian says ObamaCare is going to impact Franklin County 
workers.
  The Weekly Standard reports Wisconsin grocery store forced to cut 
hours due to ObamaCare.
  The Huffington Post reports that White Castle indicates that 
ObamaCare is causing them to consider only hiring part-time workers.
  KHN indicates Wellpoint sees small employers dropping their health 
coverage.
  There's more.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. I would point out that these are from all 
over the country. Growing worries about ObamaCare forcing insurers out 
of State markets.
  Iowa Public Radio: Full-time vs part-time workers. Restaurants weigh 
ObamaCare.
  ObamaCare forces work-hour limits for CMU students.
  Brevard cuts some workers' part-time hours to avoid ObamaCare rules.
  ObamaCare delay is a relief for a family business.

                              {time}  2130

  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. So we're already picking up on some trends 
here. From a number of the headlines, we're getting the sense that this 
health care law is not what we were told it would be, what the American 
people were told it would be. It's not sustainable. That's why there's 
all manner of taxes, from medical device taxes to what was once a 
tanning tax. They're looking for revenue under every rock to make this 
thing sustainable.
  It doesn't control costs. By some estimates in my own State, the 
State of Indiana, premiums are expected to go up 70 percent-plus within 
the next year or so. There are problems about access that we're hearing 
about that are captured in articles around the country. Rural areas, in 
particular, can expect to have a shortage of doctors as a direct result 
of this law. And there are quality concerns.
  I've just listed my thoughts on what health care reform ought to 
accomplish. All those various things ought to happen. Unfortunately, 
ObamaCare is failing on every front. And I don't say this with any 
celebration. I lament the fact. It's all the more reason that we need 
to continue to educate our colleagues and that minority of the American 
people that still believe this is going to work.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. As we see here:
  Texas Business Owner Facing $1 Million in Annual ObamaCare Costs;
  Maryland Employers Cutting Hours Due to ObamaCare;
  Waitress Said She's Losing Full-Time Status Due to the ObamaCare 
Rule;
  St. Pete College: HCC Cut Adjuncts' Hours Over Health Care;
  Local Entrepreneur Sells Part of Business Due to ObamaCare.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. There are people behind every one of these 
headlines.
  Forbes says: Labor Unions Are Indicating That ObamaCare Will Shatter 
Our Health Benefits and Cause Nightmare Scenarios.
  My recollection was that labor was very much behind this bill, 
originally. I would love to work with them or any members of union or 
union leadership

[[Page H5335]]

to be part of the solution here to help alleviate some of the pain. 
Welcome home.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. I share your feeling there. I found common 
ground with a lot of labor union folks on the Keystone pipeline because 
they want the jobs.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Absolutely.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Here, the labor unions are realizing this is 
a nightmare.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Well, they're hearing from their members.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. The members are speaking out.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. That's right.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Here you see:
  Restaurant Shift: Sorry, Just Part-Time.
  There's a theme here.
  Workers' Hours Cut--`ObamaCare' Blamed.
  Again, for those just tuning in, we're just reading news headlines, 
not op-eds. These are news headlines, stories from around the country, 
everything from the Weekly Standard to the Huffington Post, the AP.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Objective journalists.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. ObamaCare Strikes: Part-Time Jobs Surge to 
All-Time High; Full-Time Jobs Plunge by 240,000;
  16,500 Working Fewer Hours Due to ObamaCare Mandate.
  This is one of the mandates we've been talking about here tonight.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Let me press ``pause'' here before we read more 
of these headlines, which are incredibly illustrative and instructive.
  So many of them deal with the cut in the number of hours for our wage 
earners during the worst economy since the Great Depression.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Sure.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Why is that happening? Why is that happening?
  Well, you've got employers that are now mandated to provide health 
insurance to their employees, and many of them, in order to remain 
profitable, must change their way of doing business. So they change 
people from full-time into a part-time status. They hire people into 
part-time positions rather than full-time positions.
  And then we have, perhaps most pathetically and tragically, what has 
been dubbed the ``29er effect,'' where people are working more than 30 
hours a week, many of whom are barely getting by, barely able to put 
food on the table and meet their utility bills and so on, that are 
being dropped down to 29 or fewer hours.
  How is that helpful to the American people?
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. And these are folks that the Obama 
administration says are full-time, but they're really not full-time. 
They may be working 35 hours a week. They don't even have a truly full-
time, 40-hour-a-week job, what most folks across America know to be 
full-time. We talked about this before. Who said that 30 hours is full-
time?
  A lot of folks working 35 hours are trying to make ends meet. They 
would rather work 40 and get some other time. But what is happening is 
they're being cut back below 30, which is not just the number of hours 
they work. It's simultaneously reducing the money they take home.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. That's right. And we have legislation here, 
again, to address this problem, like the Saving American Workers Act. 
There's lots of cosponsors here in the House.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. That's your bill.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. I introduced the bill in response to some of 
the same things I'm hearing from my colleagues who are, in turn, 
hearing from their constituents and the sort of things I hear back home 
in Indiana, which is this is absolutely ridiculous. We're helping very 
few people at the expense of many.
  Let's restore the definition of full-time as it's always been 
popularly understood and provide some relief. So we need to move 
forward on that. Let's continue to educate and assess what is being 
reported across the country on some of these.

  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. Houston Doctors to Close Doors Because of 
ObamaCare;
  Aetna Letter Warns Customers: `Many People Will Pay More for Health 
Insurance' Under ObamaCare;
  East Penn Cuts Cafeteria Workers' Hours to Avoid ObamaCare;
  Affordable Care Act Insurance Mandates Leading Some Businesses to Cut 
Employees' Work Hours;
  Limiting Part-Time Hours Unintended Result of Health Law.
  Maybe the unintended consequences have something to do with the fact 
they didn't know half of what was in the law in the first place.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. That's right.
  I've seen some Indiana headlines--a number of them--related to some 
of these effects. One pops out there for me.
  The Indianapolis News: School Part-Timers Fear Fewer Hours, Less Pay, 
as Impact of Health Care Law Kicks In.
  Let's remember this is not just businesses that are being impacted. 
We've got municipalities, school workers, and businesses, especially in 
the hospitality industry or your retail sector, where we see a lot more 
people being hired on a part-time basis. Seemingly, every aspect of our 
economy and much of our society is being adversely impacted by this 
law.
  Now, that's not to say that some people aren't helped. All things 
being equal, if we can insure a few more million people, that's a great 
thing; but with all the collateral damage created by this law and its 
unsustainability, that's the real problem here.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. And we can help those people. We can help 
those people through other means. As I said before, the idea that it's 
the ObamaCare model or nothing is a false choice. There are many other 
better patient-centered ways to do this to reach the same goal.
  Health Care Law Causing SCC to Reexamine Adjunct Faculty Members;
  Local Employers Struggle with Affordable Care Act.
  When employers are struggling, the workers are struggling. The 
families are struggling.
  ObamaCare Glitch Could Make Coverage Unaffordable for Low-Wage 
Workers;

  We're getting short on time, so I think we ought to run through 
these.
  I want to talk a little bit about where our bills are now, sitting at 
the other end of the Capitol. I want to urge our Senate friends to 
think about the opportunity they have.
  But let's take a quick look at these before we close out.

Costs;
  Part-time Staff Hours in Flux Due to ObamaCare;

by first of all thanking my colleague, Representative Young of Indiana, 
for being here with me.
  But I'd just like to point out that the employer mandate bill that 
mimics what the President did, that postpones the employer mandate for 
1 year, we passed it here with 35 Democrats, bipartisan. Your bill, the 
individual mandate postponement, 22 Democrats. We passed them out of 
here. We did our job.
  The worst the White House could say about my bill is that it was 
redundant. Those bills are sitting down in the Senate, waiting for 
action.
  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Redundant to the Treasury Department's blog 
post, it bears reminding. They're sitting over there, gathering dust, 
as the American people demand relief. It is so important.
  I want to thank you for your leadership on this issue. Those in 
Arkansas are well represented by you on this and other matters, working 
very hard to ensure that where relief can be provided, we provide it; 
where the prerogatives of the legislative branch can be defended, you 
will defend them.
  That's where I stand as well. We just need the United States Senate 
to act.
  Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas. On the employer mandate delay, they should 
pass that immediately to make the President's actions legal, and they 
should pass the individual mandate delay to make the President's 
actions fair.
  I appreciate you being here with me tonight. You are an outstanding 
member of the Ways and Means Committee, and I appreciate your 
leadership.
  We're running out of time. I want to thank folks for joining us 
tonight, and I yield back the balance of my time.

[Pages S5584-S5602]
      KEEP STUDENT LOANS AFFORDABLE ACT OF 2013--MOTION TO PROCEED

  Mr. REID. I move to proceed to Calendar No. 124, S. 1238, Senator 
Reed's student loan bill.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by 
title.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1238) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 
     to extend the current reduced interest rate for undergraduate 
     Federal Direct Stafford Loans for 1 year, to modify required 
     distribution rules for pension plans, and for other purposes.


                                Schedule

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following the remarks of Senator McConnell, 
the time until noon will be equally divided and controlled between the 
two leaders, with each Senator permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes 
each.
  At noon there will be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed on S. 
1238, the student loan bill.


                   Recognition of the Minority Leader

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is 
recognized.
  Mr. McCONNELL. For more than a month, I have been coming to the floor 
to talk about student loan reform. I have said that to an outside 
observer, this is an issue that should have been an easy bipartisan 
slam dunk. I have noted that the proposals put forward by both 
President Obama and congressional Republicans have been strikingly 
similar. We both agree on the need for a permanent reform, and we agree 
on the need to help all students and not just some of them. Yet here we 
are after the July 1 deadline and Democrats are still blocking 
bipartisan student loan reform.
  You have to ask yourself why. It is because they have prioritized 
politics over helping students. There are basically two different 
Democratic groups battling for supremacy: a more responsible reform-
permanently faction and a more political campaign-permanently faction.
  In the first group are the sensible Democratic Senators who agree 
with both President Obama and Republicans that it is time to finally 
solve this issue. Washington should actually help students and stop 
using them as pawns in a political chess match. They support the 
bipartisan compromise plan put forward by Democratic, Republican, and 
Independent Senators alike.
  Unfortunately, this faction is opposed and outnumbered by the 
campaign-permanently Democrats. They are the ones whom I suspect would 
actually prefer to see rates lapse so they can manufacture another 
campaign issue. To hear the musings of some top Democrats, one would 
have to conclude that the Democratic leadership is on the side of 
campaigning permanently and against helping students.
  As the majority leader put it a few weeks ago: ``[We're] not looking 
for compromise.''
  Another Democratic Senator in leadership boasted a goal in this 
debate was to show ``the difference between the two parties on a key 
issue.''
  I mean, this is just the kind of thing that makes people so cynical 
about Washington. Washington Democrats yell and wave their arms about 
the need for something, and then they appear to do everything possible 
behind the scenes to sabotage it, apparently so they can manufacture a 
politically convenient crisis. They are doing it on student loans, and 
they have been doing it with nominations too.
  All week it seems they have been breathlessly telling any reporter 
who will listen that we have a nominations crisis around here; that 
Republicans are holding up the President's nominees. It is really 
laughable.
  To hear some of the over-the-top rhetoric, one would think 
Republicans have blocked all of the President's second-term Cabinet 
nominees. But then, of course, you would be entirely wrong.
  The truth is, since the President swore his oath of office in 
January, the Senate has confirmed every single Cabinet pick that has 
been brought up for a vote--every single one of them.
  Let me repeat that. Every single one that has been brought up for a 
vote, all of them have been confirmed. Many of them have been confirmed 
on unanimous or nearly unanimous votes. Yesterday, the ranking 
Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee announced his 
support for an up-or-down vote on Gina McCarthy's nomination to be EPA 
Administrator. So there is no question she is going to be confirmed.

  It is clear that facts are getting in the way of the Democrats' 
arguments, which is why they are forced to gin up this fake--absolutely 
fake--nominations ``crisis.'' It is why we see them bringing out all 
the nominees who have been appointed to office either illegally or who 
are exceedingly controversial. Democrats themselves have delayed 
consideration of these nominees literally for months--because the 
majority leader determines the timing--so they could pull them all out 
of the woodwork at the same time, in the hopes the Senate would reject 
them.
  Democrats are out there daring the Senate to do it. They want it so 
badly it appears to be their goal. And there is a reason for this. It 
is because the far-left base seems to be getting fed up with the 
democratic process. The big labor bosses are sick of waiting for the 
special interest legislative kickbacks they must feel they are owed, 
and now they know that altering the rules of our democracy is the only 
way to get what they want.
  This isn't going to work. The facts show the truth, and the truth is 
that any crisis over nominations is a crisis of Washington Democrats' 
own making--one they have stirred up intentionally--an absolutely 
manufactured crisis by any objective analysis.
  As of last night, there were 140 nominees pending in various 
committees.

[[Page S5585]]

These nominees are under the control of the majority, not us. And there 
are a little over two dozen or so eligible for expedited floor 
consideration, many of whom Republicans have already said we would pass 
unanimously. Why hasn't the majority leader called for votes on any of 
these folks? Clearly, if anyone is obstructing here, it is the majority 
leader, because this whole conversation isn't about making the Senate 
work better, and he knows it. It is all about his power grab. Well, let 
me caution him again to think long and hard about what he is doing.
  As one of the most senior members of the Democratic Party said 
yesterday, deploying the nuclear option would mean breaking the rules 
to change the rules--breaking the rules to change the rules. As the 
majority leader himself once said, it would ``ruin our country.'' And 
we all know why. Once the trigger is pulled, there would be no limit to 
the consequences, not just for Republicans or for our country but for 
Democrats too. They should think very carefully about the ramifications 
for them when a future Republican President makes his own appointments 
to the Cabinet and to the Federal bench.
  Look, we know Senate Democrats are not serious about implementing 
student loan reform. They have already demonstrated that by blocking 
just about every bipartisan effort to do so. But on the nuclear option, 
it is certainly my hope that cooler heads will prevail. I have to 
believe they will choose the long-term health of our democracy and of 
their party over what frankly amounts to the narrowest--the narrowest--
of short-term political considerations. Pulling the nuclear trigger is 
not something the history books will look favorably on, and they know 
it. And, of course, there will be consequences.
  When the President was in the Senate back in 2005, and the then-
Republican majority was thinking about something akin to this, this is 
what the President had to say. ``If they choose to change the rules and 
put an end to the democratic debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, 
and the gridlock will only get worse.'' The President was entirely 
correct.
  Senator Reid said in 2009, a couple of years ago, ``There is no way I 
would employ the use of the nuclear option. No way.'' He said it would 
``ruin our country.'' He said, ``It would have destroyed the Senate as 
we know it.''
  Hopefully, that was not then and there is some different standard 
now. And, of course, we know we had this debate at the beginning of the 
year. Actually, we have had it at the beginning of the last two 
Congresses, and the Senate--the occupant of the Chair had newly arrived 
here--voted on two rules changes and two standing orders, after which 
the majority leader said, ``The rules issue for this Congress is 
over.''
  He gave his word in January of this year. We are waiting to see if 
that word will be kept.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor.


                       Reservation of Leader Time

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved.


                           Order of Business

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time 
until 12 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two 
leaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 
10 minutes each.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the 
future of student loans for America's students. When I say students, I 
have to define who that is because, as we know, today we have students 
of all ages.
  We have a category of students where a financial impact requirement 
is applied, such as for a 19-year-old who has entered their freshman 
year, and depending upon where the income of their family is, under the 
current system they may get a subsidized loan. The maximum they can 
receive under that subsidized loan as an undergraduate is $3,500.
  I would be willing to bet the President pro tempore and I both can't 
pick an institution in any of our States where the tuition on an annual 
basis is $3,500. It doesn't happen today, and that is the reality that 
has been left out of the debate so far. This debate has been all about 
politics and it has not been about students and how to apply 
affordability as broadly as we can in the marketplace.
  Let me describe where we are today. Between 1965 and 1992 the cap on 
the student loan program in this country was 10 percent--10 percent. In 
the mid-2000s, Congress, very politically, said: You know what. We are 
going to adjust it, and subsidized loans are going to be at 3.4 percent 
and nonsubsidized loans are going to be at 6.8 percent, graduate loans 
are going to be at 7.9 percent, and if you are a parent borrowing, you 
are going to have an even higher rate, in the 8-plus percent range.
  That strikes me as incredibly unfair. We are taking two 
undergraduates--two 19-year-old freshmen--entering the same institution 
with the same financial obligation and we are saying to one: We are 
going to give you a rate on your student loan that is half of the 
person who sits in the seat next to you--half. In this chair, the 
student will pay 3.4 percent, and the student sitting in the chair next 
to him will pay 6.8 percent. Understand, the parents of the person 
sitting in this chair, depending upon the cost of the institution, may 
have an income over $100,000. Yet they may qualify for a Federal 
subsidy.
  Let me suggest to you that the marketplace is the thing that ought to 
dictate and decide what the rate is. That is the only thing that is 
fair to the taxpayers in this country--the predictability of knowing it 
is tied to something.
  Let me suggest that the bill we are going to take up--and we are 
going to vote on a motion to proceed at 12 noon today--is a bill that 
was created in the 2000s. Two years ago we kicked the can down the road 
and said we are going to extend this inequitable student loan program 
at 3.4 percent for some, 6.8 percent for others, 7.9 percent, and 8-
plus percent for parents. Why? Because we are overcharging some to 
subsidize others. Let me say that again. We are overcharging some--we 
are overcharging some 19-year-old undergraduate freshmen in college--at 
6.8 percent so they will subsidize the 3.4 percent we are charging on 
the subsidized loans.
  Let me point to a chart I have here which shows undergraduates under 
the student loan program. This is a comparison. Actually, let me move 
to a different chart, because this one best displays what I am talking 
about.
  Twenty-six percent of our Nation's kids are undergraduates and are 
subsidized, and 55 percent of the eligible students are either 
undergraduates or graduate students who fall under a 6.8-percent 
interest rate. So when the Senate majority leader came to the floor and 
said some were upstairs trying to negotiate a deal, he was 100-percent 
accurate. But the reality is we are still only going to have a vote on 
one plan at 12 o'clock. There is no option for Members of Congress.
  What I would suggest is that this displays why, at best, there should 
be two options and, at worst, we ought to vitiate the motion to proceed 
and see if we can come up with another bipartisan agreement.
  You see, another option--the Manchin bill--is a bipartisan approach.
  It is Democrats and Republicans coming together and saying we can 
agree on something that we think is fair and equitable and financially 
sustainable.
  But this is the plan we are going to have a vote on at 12. Fifty-five 
percent of the population of students, quite frankly, are being 
screwed. They are overpaying. They are paying 6.8 percent for interest, 
when a home mortgage for 15 years is 3.8 percent. Yet we are charging 
students 6.8 percent, and we are saying that to go to this is an 
injustice to our students, where all of a sudden we take 64 percent of 
the kids and we treat them all alike and we charge them 3.66 percent. 
Something is inherently wrong in the debate we are having.
  If this is about kids and about affordability, this is the plan on 
which we

[[Page S5586]]

should be having the motion to proceed, not this one. This plan merely 
kicks the can down the road for 12 more months.
  Let me say this plan wasn't created by Joe Manchin or Richard Burr or 
Tom Coburn or Senator King or Senator Alexander. This plan was created 
by the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office in 
their March 2011 report to Congress came up with the idea of tying the 
interest rate to the 10-year Treasury bond, except the CBO says it 
should be the 10-year Treasury bond plus 3 percent. That is what 
Senator Coburn and I introduced. When Senator Manchin, Senator King, 
Senator Alexander, Senator Carper, and others got involved, we decided 
what we needed to do was continue to have a blended rate. We all agreed 
that an undergraduate student shouldn't face an interest rate schedule 
that is not equitable to all undergraduates.
  So instead of applying it to 26 percent, we applied it to 100 percent 
of the undergraduates. We said: If you are an undergraduate in college, 
we are going to give you the best rate, which is the 10-year bond plus 
1.85. It is fair. It is understandable. It is predictable. It is 
consistent. One year in advance you know exactly what your rate is 
going to be because it is determined on the 10-year bond every May.
  My good friend Senator Harkin, whom I have great affection for, came 
to the floor and said we were balancing the budget on the back of the 
student loan program. The student loan program is a $1.3 trillion 
program. Based upon the CBO score on this bill, it had a 0.7-percent 
surplus. By Washington standards, in a $1 billion program, 0.7 would be 
a rounding error. This is a $1.3 trillion program. Let me assure the 
President and my colleagues, this is a rounding error. I can't look 
everybody in the face and say it might not cost us $100 billion. It 
might save us $100 billion. But we are certainly not balancing a $17 
trillion deficit debt on the back of the student loan program. Let me 
assure you of that, and for any who suggest we are, that is, in fact, 
disingenuous.
  This is the first time I have been accused of balancing the budget on 
the backs of our kids. But in 2010, as part of the health care reform 
act, Democrats ended the Federal Family Education Loan Program, FFEL, 
at a savings of $61 billion. Of that, the Democrats directed $19 
billion to deficit reduction and the rest to help pay for ObamaCare, 
the Affordable Care Act.
  If I am being accused of balancing the budget on 0.7 percent, 
determined by CBO, and in 2010 the Democrats voted to eliminate the 
FFEL Program and save $61 billion and applied $19 billion to deficit 
reduction and the rest to help the Affordable Care Act, then they 
plowed this ground long before I did.
  As a matter of fact, in 2007, as part of the College Cost Reduction 
and Access Act, the Democrats found $21 billion in savings and spent a 
good amount of it on new programs--and then directed $1 billion to 
deficit reduction.
  I said earlier, I have great affection for Senator Harkin. Senator 
Harkin said this should be part of the Higher Education Reauthorization 
Act--that may or may not happen next year.
  We made changes to the interest rate on student loans outside of the 
higher education reauthorization in 2012 with a 1-year extension of the 
3.4 percent. We did it in 2010 with the elimination of the FFEL 
Program. We did it in 2005 under the CCRAA, the Deficit Reduction Act. 
Senator Harkin's Appropriations Committee has made changes to the 
eligibility rules for Pell grants each of the past several years 
outside of the higher education authorization, including the 
elimination of summer eligibility, ability to benefit, and lowering of 
the automatic enrollment for low-income students.
  It is not fair to come and say to me that I am doing it outside of 
higher education reauthorization when there is continually a track 
record of the person who accused us of doing it of doing it himself.
  Mr. MANCHIN. Would the Senator yield?
  Mr. BURR. I would be happy to yield.
  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the good Senator for working in such a 
bipartisan manner. I think this truly is a bipartisan bill.
  This bill has been described as belonging to one party or the other, 
and that is wrong. Senator Burr, Senator Alexander, Senator Coburn, 
Senator King, Senator Carper, and I sat down and looked at how we could 
fix something. We looked at it from the standpoint that this deadline 
has hit. One year ago we extended it. They said it was the political 
atmosphere and we had to extend it. We knew that year would come and, 
similar to everything else that has happened here for the last 2 or 3 
years, nothing gets done. We just said: Enough is enough. It has to be 
fixed, and if we want to fix it, to understand the program, we have to 
look at the whole program.
  I think now they are making accusations that students are paying 
profits so we can pay down the debt. Whether there is profit built in 
depends on the accounting procedures used by our Federal Government. It 
was built in. You can blame whomever you want to blame, but it is built 
into it. We have to deal with the facts in front of us.
  What I would ask the Senator, all of us have agreed in a bipartisan 
manner that no profit will be made on the backs of students, what we 
can determine through the bill we are working on, right?
  Mr. BURR. That is 100 percent correct.
  Mr. MANCHIN. So we have all come to that agreement--Democrats and 
Republicans--no profit in debt reduction. It should go to lowering the 
rate.
  Mr. BURR. That is correct.
  Mr. MANCHIN. We agreed on that. We have agreed on a long-term fix, 10 
years, rather than kicking it down the road another year, knowing 
another year will come and go and we are probably going to be standing 
here debating. That is the conclusion we have come to, which is 
different than what the House sent us. I applaud the Senator for 
working with us to put in a fixed rate.
  So if it is at 3.66 this year and I am able to qualify and I am 
subsidized at $3,500 of a subsidized loan the taxpayer will be paying, 
that 3.66 is fixed for the full life of the loan. We agreed on that, 
correct?
  Mr. BURR. That is correct.
  Mr. MANCHIN. So when they say it is a Republican bill or a Democratic 
bill, that is erroneous. That is not fair. This is truly a bipartisan 
effort, and we are working with all of our colleagues in my caucus--and 
I know the Senator is in his caucus--to understand that if I have a 
subsidized Stafford loan, that means the Federal Government--the 
taxpayers of this country--will pay my interest while I am in school, 
correct?
  Mr. BURR. That is correct.
  Mr. MANCHIN. At the end of that, then I pick up whatever interest 
rate has accumulated while I was in school, and I take it from that day 
forward.
  What I think a lot of our colleagues don't understand, I can't make 
it just on that $3,500. I have to borrow more money. So now, if I go 
with my colleagues on the Democratic side, if I borrow more money, I 
have to borrow that at 6.8 percent.
  We were able, in a bipartisan way, to bring that to 3.66 percent for 
all undergraduates, correct?
  Mr. BURR. The Senator is correct. I might add to my good friend, this 
chart shows exactly what we talked about. Under the plan on which we 
will vote at 12, because of the need for students in the subsidized 
category to borrow additional money at 6.8 percent, at the end of their 
process, they owe $78 a month, where under the bipartisan bill, where 
every undergraduate is treated the same, they owe $75. It is actually 
cheaper, even for the undergrads who are subsidized.
  Mr. MANCHIN. So the money I would have to borrow, even though I 
qualify because of my income for a subsidized loan, I don't have to pay 
the interest on an annual basis. So by bringing it down to one low 
rate, I am making much lower payments. So that is less obligation and 
less hardship on me as a college student to make that lower payment 
than it would be to make that higher payment.
  We want to help the subsidized, very poor kids. I might be poor, but 
I can't make it on just what you give me because I am poor. I have to 
have a little more help. Then, on top of that, I want to go to graduate 
school after I get my college degree. So then I am at 6.8 again. Ours 
brings it down to 5.21, which is more savings, which I know the Senator 
agrees to.
  If I may ask my colleague from Tennessee, right now we know we have a

[[Page S5587]]

consolidated cap at 8.25 percent. Let's say I graduate and I went to 
school during the high recession times. At the end, I have an 8.75-
percent accumulative interest I owe. I can cap that and consolidate at 
8.25, correct?
  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator from 
West Virginia.
  First, I wish to congratulate Senators Manchin and Burr for helping 
the full Senate understand this issue. This is similar to a lot of 
issues we have to face. They are not simple. I used to be a college 
president and the U.S. Secretary of Education. I had to re-educate 
myself on this legislation. I still made some mistakes.
  I was saying last night, for example, that there were only 2 million 
subsidized loans. What I was forgetting was the point that the Senator 
from West Virginia makes, which is that 80 percent of the students who 
have subsidized loans, the low-income students, also have unsubsidized 
loans. So when we only take care of these subsidized loans, we are 
leaving 7 million students with unsubsidized loans out here hanging 
high and dry, and nobody is taking care of them. So we are hurting both 
the middle-class families and the low-income families when we have an 
incomplete solution.
  The Senator from West Virginia posed a question. Let's say I 
graduated from the University of Tennessee and I had two loans; I had a 
subsidized loan, which means the government paid my interest while I 
was in college. Typically, if I am similar to four out of five 
students, I also had an unsubsidized loan, so I accrued that interest. 
Suddenly the interest rates have gone up for me because the country's 
interest rates have gone up to 10 percent. What I can do is take all my 
government loans at once and turn them into an 8.25-percent loan. So 
that is, in effect, a cap on my loan, and then I would have the choice.
  I would say this to the Senators from West Virginia and North 
Carolina. I have heard some Senators say that when I consolidate my 
loan at 8.25 percent, that means the student is going to have to pay a 
lot of interest because it spreads the loan out over a long period of 
time.
  But does not the student have that choice? Isn't it similar to a 15-
year mortgage, where you have higher monthly payments, but you pay less 
interest because you pay it off quicker?
  Mr. MANCHIN. I think what they are referring to--and I might have 
misunderstood, but I think I am accurate on this. Everyone will take 
the loans for the longest period of time, and I just got out of school 
so I want the smallest payment. Four or five years out I have a better 
job. Instead of paying $150 a month, I can afford to pay $300 or $400.
  There is no penalty for me to shorten that, as it would be in a 
conventional market. Is that how the Senator understands it?
  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask consent that the Senators from 
North Carolina and West Virginia and I be permitted to engage in a 
colloquy for a few minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is how I understand it. I would say to the 
Senator from North Carolina,--I would presume a graduate of the 
University of North Carolina would be smart enough to make that 
decision for herself or himself?
  Mr. BURR. I think they would. I think one of the agreements we came 
to was that students ought to be in control of their decision about 
their loan rate based upon what is available to them. If students go 
through the next 4 years and they have a combined interest rate of 
about 4.5 percent for the life of the loan, why in the world would they 
be excited at 8.25? If for some reason 10 years from now somebody got 
out of school and their combined interest rate was 9 percent, we give 
them the option of going back to 8.25.
  I think the Senator from West Virginia made an extremely good point. 
For the most subsidized students, they can only borrow $3,500. Think of 
the institutions that are out there--none of them have an annual 
tuition of $3,500. We know they are going to borrow out of the 6.8-
percent pot. What we are offering is that the pots are the same and 
that the subsidy is that--for students who qualify for the subsidy--
they are not responsible for the interest rate while they are in 
school. That subsidy still exists. It is just that we are not 
overcharging one group and we are certainly not overcharging the ones 
we just subsidized because they have to borrow more money to complete 
their college education.
  Mr. MANCHIN. To both of my friends, let me say that I graduate from 
college--no matter what the interest rates are, no matter what they 
might have been--I graduate and economic times are tough. I find a job 
that is not what I think my value is, but I find a job at $40,000--
$40,000. I am married now, and I have a child or two. Don't we have in 
our bill a protection which has been in place for a long time--both 
Democrats and Republicans have supported this protection--which is 
called income-based repayment? By law, I can only pay 15 percent of my 
disposable income. I think that breaks down to my payment can only be 
$142. Isn't that a subsidy too? Wouldn't we be subsidizing that to an 
extent? I am also understanding that if my economic condition does not 
improve and that is all I pay, by the end of 25 years it is exonerated. 
I pay nothing. I am done.
  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I could respond to the Senator who suggested 
that,--the answer is yes. I think it is fair to say that the 
consolidation option that a student has in case the rates go up, at 
8.25 percent can be called a cap. It is not a hard cap, but it is a 
cap. And the second cap is the income repayment provision of which the 
Senator speaks. If you are making $40,000 a year, after they apply the 
formula you probably are not spending more than about 10 percent of 
your income--it is something called disposable income--to pay for your 
student loan. Loan repayment then continues for about 20 years. If at 
the end of 20 years you have not paid your loan off, the loan is 
forgiven.
  Any student who has a loan has that opportunity. They can consolidate 
at 8.25 percent, and income repayment limits the amount they have to 
pay each year. So they have that.
  One of the things I noticed about the Manchin-Burr bill that I would 
like to ask the Senators to talk about is that you have come up with--
what I am beginning to understand, as I study this more and more--a 
very significant contribution: the idea that all of the undergraduate 
student loans--which, as I understand it, are about two out of three of 
the loans--should have the same interest rate. First, it is confusing 
the way undergraduate loan interest rates are now, but the other reason 
is that about 80 percent of the people who have subsidized loans, the 
low-income students, also have unsubsidized loans. So your contribution 
is to say: Let's simplify it, provide certainty over a long period of 
time, and treat all undergraduates the same. Otherwise, it seems to me, 
you are leaving 7 million middle-income students who have unsubsidized 
loans high and dry, and the 80 percent of the low-income students who 
also have these unsubsidized loans, you are not helping them either.
  I wonder if the Senator could comment on this idea? I notice, without 
a cap, you are able to get the interest rate for all undergraduate 
loans down to about 3.66 percent, which is a pretty low rate.
  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me say very quickly--and I will use $10 million 
hypothetically that is borrowed every year--$10 billion, $10 million, 
whatever you want to use--25 percent of that money goes to the 
subsidized, just 25 percent. I understand that it is close to about 40 
percent of the students who participate in borrowing money, but the 
volume of money is about 25 percent, one-fourth of the money that is 
loaned out. So if we are keeping the rates low on one-fourth of the 
money, that means we artificially have much higher rates on three-
fourths of the money students need to get an education.
  What we are saying is that we are going to bring a larger majority of 
that down to the lowest rate. We think it is a good policy that we 
should be discussing and talking about. That is where we are. That is 
why we came up with the plan we did, but we reduced all the rates. The 
PLUS loans I think went from 7.9 to 6.21, yes, and then the graduate 
loans went from 6.8 to 5.21.

[[Page S5588]]

But if you do all of the undergraduate, it would go from 3.4 to 3.66, a 
quarter and a point--.26.
  Mr. BURR. The most significant part is for the undergraduates who 
were not subsidized, they would go from 6.8 to 3.6.
  Mr. MANCHIN. Right. Right.
  Mr. BURR. This goes to the heart of what the Senator from Tennessee 
said. Today the subsidy goes to 26 percent of our students; 55 percent 
pay the 6.8 rate. Under the bipartisan bill, 64 percent--all 
undergraduates--get 3.66.
  If this is about affordability, if this is about what provides the 
greatest flexibility for students to afford it, then the answer is 
clear. It is on the chart. But it also computes in the monthly payments 
to which students are obligated. The f.."

  Mr. BURGESS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged 
report (Rept. No. 113-397) on the resolution (H. Res. 530) providing 
for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2575) to amend the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 to repeal the 30-hour threshold for classification as a 
full-time employee for purposes of the employer mandate in the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act and replace it with 40 hours, which 
was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed.

                       SAVE AMERICAN WORKERS ACT

  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
Hoosier colleague, Representative Todd Young's excellent bill, the Save 
American Workers Act of 2014.
  We are a country built on hard work. We are a country where people 
want to work. But right now, the Affordable Care Act is stopping people 
from working the hours they need and the hours they want to work. By 
redefining a full-time employee as someone who works 30 or more hours a 
week, the Affordable Care Act has caused workers' hours to be reduced 
in vital industries across the Nation. 2.6 million workers are losing 
because of this provision. America is losing because of this provision.
  A school employee from my district in Elwood, Indiana, recently 
shared with me the pain losing 10 hours from her workweek has caused. 
She said:

       It just doesn't make sense to me. I'm trying to be a self-
     supporting person and was doing good. It could have been 
     better, but I was making it. How am I supposed to pay a house 
     payment, utilities, car insurance, let alone food?

  This is an unwise provision that must be repealed. That is why we 
must take action and restore the traditional 40-hour workweek. Let's 
pass the Save American Workers Act of 2014. If we do, our workers win, 
our employers win, and our Nation will win.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 11, 2012

  Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of repealing the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  It's no secret that the U.S. health care system is broken; however, 
instead of strengthening the system, the Affordable Care Act took a 
top-down approach that will leave patients and taxpayers worse off than 
they were before.
  I believe Americans should have access to effective and affordable 
care. This can best be accomplished by using market forces to improve 
quality and control cost.
  I support allowing individuals to purchase health insurance across 
state lines and the expansion of associated health plans, health 
savings accounts, and other free-market reforms that allow individuals 
to be in control of their own healthcare decisions.
  Americans have a choice when they buy a car or go to the grocery 
store. Why can't they have that same choice when purchasing something 
as important as health care?
  I also support allowing small employers and individuals to pool 
together to purchase health insurance, thereby giving them greater 
buying power to negotiate when purchasing a plan.
  Expanding health savings accounts not only gives individuals maximum 
flexibility in determining how to spend their health care dollars, but 
it encourages saving and helps reduce the overall cost of health care.
  Finally, I support reforming the tax code so individuals get the same 
incentives that employers currently have for purchasing health care.
  These measures will make health care more affordable, and unlike the 
law we are repealing today, they are sustainable.
  I yield back the balance of my time.

                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, yesterday we received news that 4 
million people have now signed up in private health care exchanges all 
across the country. In addition, it was released that about 12 million 
people have called the call centers in January alone, and 1.1 million 
people signed up to receive health care through the Affordable Care Act 
during that time. Young enrollment--the group of individuals for which 
there has always been a question as to whether they are going to sign 
up for these exchanges--grew by 65 percent.
  It is time for this body to recognize the Affordable Care Act is 
working. It is working for people who have been desperate to get 
insurance. It is working for people who have been getting the short end 
of the stick from insurance companies, and it is working for millions 
of seniors all across this country who have been paying far too much 
for prescription drug costs and for preventive health care.
  We have known this from the very beginning in Connecticut. Despite 
the hiccups over enrollment in the fall period, States such as 
Connecticut that had made a commitment to making this law work, rather 
than undermining it, have seen the success from day one. Connecticut, 
at the outset, said that we were going to try to enroll between October 
1 and March 31 about 80,000 people. That was our goal. We just 
announced in Connecticut--a State that is working to implement the law, 
not undermine the law--that we didn't just hit 80,000, we didn't just 
hit 100,000, but we have enrolled 126,000 Connecticut residents in our 
health care exchanges and in Medicaid. Our projection is that we are 
going to enroll 150,000 people by March 31. That is nearly double our 
initial estimate. Last week, traffic on Connecticut's Web site rose 31 
percent, and the daily enrollments rose by 67 percent.
  The stories just keep on coming into our office about the lives that 
are being changed as people, for the first time in their lives, get 
access to affordable health care. People such as Susie Clayton, who has 
been dealing with a cancer diagnosis for over a decade--a crippling, 
preexisting condition that for most of her adult life has kept her out 
of the ranks of the insured. I have known Susie for probably two 
decades. Almost every single conversation I have had with Susie over 
those 20 years has been about her daily struggle to try to deal with 
her illness and her preexisting condition. Every single day, every 
single week, she has thought about whether she is going to be able to 
pay for her health care if she has a reoccurrence of her cancer and 
whether during that time she is going to have a job that provides her 
with insurance.
  Susie had been paying about $1,700 a month at last count for an 
insurance plan she could afford. Her life changed on January 1. She now 
is paying a couple hundred dollars a month in premiums. She finally 
gets to wake up every day not having to worry about whether she is 
going to be able to afford coverage, whether she is going to be able to 
see a doctor to deal with her very difficult diagnosis. With 4 million 
people now enrolled in these exchanges across the country, that story 
can be replicated over and over.
  A bunch of our Republican colleagues have come to the floor over the 
last couple of days--I was in the presiding chair yesterday listening 
to some speeches--regarding some new information about Medicare 
Advantage. Everybody knows by now that included in the health care bill 
was an end to the subsidies given to Medicare Advantage plans. The 
private sector in health care and in other industries always tells us 
they can do things more cheaply than the Federal Government--and a lot 
of times they are right about that--but it was exactly the opposite 
when it came to Medicare Advantage. We were paying private insurance 
companies 13 percent more than it costs the Federal Government to run 
Medicare. This was a source of enormous profit for the insurance 
companies. It didn't make sense to oversubsidize insurance companies to 
run a program the Federal Government itself was running for 13 percent 
less money. So we ended those subsidies, and part of the elimination of 
those subsidies has gone into effect.
  But the story that is being told on the floor today isn't true. The 
fact is that since the Affordable Care Act was

[[Page S1142]]

passed, even as we have been implementing these cuts to these overly 
generous, unjustifiable subsidies to insurance companies, Medicare 
Advantage enrollment has gone up by 30 percent. Thirty percent more 
seniors are now enrolled in Medicare Advantage, even as these cuts have 
been imposed. Premiums are down. Medicare Advantage premiums have been 
reduced by 10 percent.
  Over the course of the debate on the Medicare Advantage cuts, I heard 
Republican after Republican, when I was in the House of 
Representatives, come to the floor and tell us that the sky was going 
to fall when we ended these subsidies to insurance companies. I will be 
honest. A lot of them are in my State of Connecticut. Not only has the 
sky not fallen, it has risen, with 30 percent more seniors in Medicare 
Advantage with 10 percent less in premiums. To the argument I have 
heard on this floor that there will be less choices available to 
seniors because of these cuts going into effect, let's just be honest: 
The average Medicare beneficiary has 18 different Medicare Advantage 
plans to choose from--18 different plans. That is a pretty robust 
market.
  Let me just add that Republicans have voted for these cuts 
themselves. The Ryan budget, which has essentially been the budget 
standard for Republicans in both the House and in the Senate--endorsed 
by hundreds of Republican legislators--the Paul Ryan budget included 
the cuts to Medicare Advantage subsidies because Republicans have 
agreed with Democrats that there is no reason to subsidize insurance 
companies instead of subsidizing beneficiaries.
  So what happened when we decided to stop subsidizing Medicare 
Advantage? Enrollment went up 30 percent. Premiums went down 10 
percent. The average beneficiary still had the choice of 18 different 
plans. But we took that money we saved in padding the pockets of health 
care insurance companies, and we told seniors that when they show up to 
get a preventive health care visit, they are not going to have to pay 
anything out-of-pocket. So since the ACA has been passed, here is how 
much a senior has to pay for their annual checkup: Nothing. So 25 
million people have gotten free preventive care since the Affordable 
Care Act has been passed.
  What else did we do? We decided that this doughnut hole in the 
prescription drug bill, whereby people got coverage up front and then 
they had to pay for a certain amount of drugs themselves and then they 
got catastrophic coverage, didn't make sense. So we eliminated the 
prescription drug doughnut hole. It will be gone by 2020. It has been 
cut by more than half already. Since the implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act, the average senior has saved $1,200 in 
prescription drug costs thanks to the Affordable Care Act.
  So as I listen to my Republican colleagues come to the floor and 
complain about the cuts to Medicare Advantage--cuts, in fact, that many 
of them have supported--I think we have to ask ourselves: If we had a 
choice to provide a 13-percent subsidy to for-profit insurance 
companies or pass along $1,200 in savings to American seniors and 
eliminate the costs that many of these fixed-income seniors pay when 
they go in to get preventive care, what would we choose? This is really 
all about choices in this body. It is about choices in terms of where 
we put the money we spend on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. To me, 
it is a no-brainer. To the American public, it is a no-brainer. Instead 
of subsidizing insurance companies, let's subsidize hard-working 
seniors, who have built this country, with $1,200 in drug savings and 
25 million people who have gotten free preventive health care.
  For Republicans who have come down to the floor and said they want to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act or that they want to repeal the cuts to 
Medicare Advantage plans, essentially they are saying they want to 
return billions of dollars to the insurance companies and take away 
that money from seniors in this country. I do not think that is a 
choice the American people are going to accept.
  This week a group of us in the Senate are launching the ACAworks 
campaign. Later today I will be joined by a number of my colleagues 
around the corner as we launch a new effort to make clear to the 
American people that now, with 4 million people enrolled, and millions 
of people saving money--notwithstanding the legitimate difficulties 
that were encountered in the first days of the Web site--the Affordable 
Care Act is working. It is working for millions and millions of people 
across this country who are finally getting care.
  We will be joined today, as well, by a couple of Medicare recipients 
who are glad they now have the protection when they get into the 
doughnut hole. They are glad they now get free preventive care. And 
they will take the choice any day of this Congress and this government 
investing in them instead of investing in big for-profit insurance 
companies.
  None of us deny there are bumps in the road as you rework one-sixth 
of the American economy, which represents our health care economy. None 
of us will deny there is no excuse for the fact that for the first few 
months there were a lot of people who were not able to enroll who 
wanted to. But now that the enrollment site is working, now that 
outreach efforts are up and running, record numbers of people are 
signing up for health care because there is an almost insatiable demand 
for quality, affordable health care that is now being met as the 
Affordable Care Act is working.
  I yield back the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I want to begin by thanking my 
colleague and friend from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, for the very 
eloquent and powerful remarks he has just made, showing America the 
Connecticut experience with health care, which shows that the 
Affordable Care Act is working and is expanding opportunities for 
health care across the country. Once the myths are exploded, once the 
truth is told, Americans will appreciate how fortunate we are to have 
this reform in the way that health care is insured and delivered for 
the American people.
  There are bumps in the road, as Senator Murphy has just said. There 
will continue to be issues to be overcome in achieving success. But the 
enormous potential to make America healthier, to eliminate the anxiety 
and anguish Americans experience in seeking a quality of life that 
health care affords, is an opportunity and obligation we cannot shirk. 
I am proud to join with him in speaking this truth and clarifying for 
people across the country the great promise of this program.
  A lot of the promise still has to be fulfilled. A lot of the 
realization about that promise has to be educated. But we will succeed 
in that effort. I thank him and my other colleagues who are joining us 
in seeking to make America realize the great potential and promise that 
we have, and already the great accomplishments that have been made.
  Connecticut stands as a model for both the promise and the 
accomplishment in the 130,000 people who have already enrolled in the 
benefits for young people now permitted to stay on their parents' 
policies, and, indeed, the elimination of preexisting conditions as an 
obstacle to insurance.
  I know about many of these issues and obstacles from my time as 
attorney general when I fought insurance companies that denied basic 
opportunities and failed to fulfill their obligation and impose these 
kinds of obstacles. Now, hopefully, insurers will be a partner in this 
effort, and so will the medical community and business community across 
the country.
  So I look forward to continuing this effort and thank him for the 
exposition he has given, and my other colleagues who will join us later 
today.
  I want to focus on a group that particularly needs health care in 
this country, and that is our veterans. We are here to talk about the 
Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay 
Restoration Act of 2014--a measure that seeks to address 
comprehensively the challenges our veterans face today.
  There are more and more veterans. We are losing some of the 
``greatest generation.'' In fact, we are losing them tragically and 
unfortunately

[[Page S1143]]

every day. But the next greatest generation needs the same benefits and 
services we have given to the ``greatest generation.'' The next 
greatest generation is serving right now and has served recently in the 
wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
  We must be unwavering in our commitment to our veterans. We must 
determine that this big and broad bill is necessary to keep faith with 
them and to make sure we meet the diverse and urgent needs they 
present.
  We all talk in this body about our commitment to veterans. But all 
too often, our Nation has failed to keep faith. I have learned that we 
all have expressed here our admiration and commitment to our Nation's 
veterans. I have introduced, as have many of my colleagues, veterans 
bills based on input from my constituents. In fact, my very first piece 
of legislation as a Senator was the Honoring All Veterans Act.
  But the reality is this comprehensive approach is necessary. I thank 
Senator Sanders as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for 
recognizing that the needs of our veterans are interlocking, 
multifaceted, and manifold in the kinds of problems that are raised as 
they leave the military and enter the civilian world.
  Sometimes it is their medical records that cannot be transferred 
seamlessly from the Department of Defense to Veterans Affairs and 
Veterans' Administration facilities. Sometimes it is the failure to 
make their military skills transferable in credentials and licensing. 
And sometimes it is medical conditions, health care needs for post-
traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury, that make their wounds 
invisible, make them difficult to discern to the ordinary eye but are 
there deeply and enduringly unless they are treated properly. That is 
why health care for them is so important and why this bill expands 
opportunity for health care so dramatically.
  The health care needs of our veterans must be met through the 
provisions of this bill that expand health care opportunities and 
services. When I first came to the Senate, I thought--and I think 
reasonably--that a veteran needing health care could simply go to a VA 
hospital to receive it. But that is really not the case. On January 17, 
2003, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it would 
``temporarily'' suspend enrolling Priority Group 8 veterans. That 
temporary restriction stands today. So under existing restrictions, a 
veteran making as little as $33,577 or a family of five making a 
household income of $50,025 can be denied health benefits in 
Connecticut. There are an estimated 720,000 Priority Group 8 veterans 
who are not enrolled in health care. Tens of thousands of veterans 
apply each year for enrollment and are denied due to that means test.
  Simply put, the VA should have the capacity and resources to serve 
every veteran. That is why section 301 of this bill would allow 
veterans who lack that access, who do not have a service-connected 
disability, and who do not have affordable health insurance, to enroll 
in the VA's health care system.
  There are other health care provisions: section 305, which expands 
the provision of chiropractic care; sections 331, 332, and 333, which 
expand complementary and alternative medicine. Anybody who has not yet 
seen ``Escape Fire'' should view it to understand the stark ways that 
veterans have challenges in access to alternative treatments and why 
drug addiction and abuse can become such a problem. And there is 
section 334, expanding wellness programs. All of these programs are 
vital, as well as the expanded access to treatment for post-traumatic 
stress and traumatic brain injury, which, in my view, are at the core 
of the need for this legislation.
  Section 342 would require the VA to contract with outside providers 
to establish a program of supportive services to family members and 
caregivers of veterans suffering from mental illness. All of these 
invisible conditions have such dramatic consequences in the 
employability of veterans and their ability to give back and continue 
to contribute to this Nation, as so many of them wish to do.
  The needs of our veterans are also pressing in disability claims. The 
need to end the backlog is, again, one of the areas addressed directly 
in this bill. The backlog of disability claims at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs has become a chronic problem. The VA is making 
progress. There is no question that the numbers are better today than 
they were. But there are still veterans such as Army veteran Jordan 
Massa in Connecticut, who served in Afghanistan, and Marine veteran 
David Alexander, who was deployed in Iraq, who had to wait too long and 
suffered as a result. We need to keep faith with those veterans.
  I understand and I applaud Secretary Shinseki, who has committed to 
tackling this problem. But some 389,000 claims are still backlogged. In 
Connecticut, about 48 percent of the claims are backlogged, meaning 
that 48 percent of claims made by our veterans take more than 125 days 
to be resolved. Each of these veterans has an individual story, a 
record of service, a record of suffering. Be it in today's wars or 
conflicts past, a record of service and sacrifice is exemplified by 
every one of them. These individuals may now be looking for employment, 
perhaps, to support a family. We need to keep faith with them.
  This legislation aims to decrease the backlog further through an 
accelerated appeals process and getting the VA the information it needs 
to decide these claims. It brings in local governments to help with the 
claims. And it helps veterans who have misfiled documents in the claims 
process to seek a better route to what they need and deserve.
  The bill also would require regular reports to Congress on efforts to 
eliminate the backlog. Accountability is so critical--accountability on 
backlogs, on all of the issues that underlie the failure to process 
these claims as quickly as they should be. And the backlog must be 
eliminated.
  Employment programs are also addressed in this bill. So are the 
traumatic effects of sexual assault. The bill is multifaceted and 
comprehensive, as it should be. To address the diverse and urgent 
needs, it must be big and broad because the needs and challenges of our 
veterans are big and broad.
  The reality is that 1 million men and women will leave the military 
over the next 5 years. One million patriotic and brave men and women 
will be separating from our Armed Forces. Becoming veterans, they will 
need services and benefits that they have earned, and they will need 
them at the time they leave, not at some distant point in the future. 
We owe it to them now to keep faith.
  I have submitted amendments that would address some of the other 
issues.
  For example, the need to recognize that post-traumatic stress is not 
only a condition that afflicts our current military men and women and 
veterans but also past veterans, even though it was undiagnosed and 
untreated at the time. Changing their status so as to recognize post-
traumatic stress for the veterans of past wars is a need that we need 
to address.
  I will make sure those veterans of past wars, whether it is Vietnam 
or Korea or any of those conflicts in our history, receive a second 
look at their discharge. That is the purpose of the amendment. That is 
the purpose of legal action that has been brought by the Yale veterans 
clinic. I will continue to support it.
  We can go further as well to enhance our veterans' health by 
including the Toxic Exposure Research and Military Family Support Act 
in this measure. I have an amendment that will do so. Many veterans 
were exposed to toxic chemicals such as Agent Orange and their needs 
are only beginning to be addressed.
  In addition to the harmful effects to those individuals, there are 
also impacts on their children. For many years those who were exposed 
to Agent Orange were told there was no evidence that their symptoms 
resulted from that. Now that we have evidence Agent Orange is toxic, we 
need to include the longer term effects on their children and their 
families. The amendment I have offered would address those issues.
  Even if none of those amendments I have proposed are adopted during 
this process, this measure stands on its own as a historic step 
forward. It is, indeed, a historic recognition of the obligation and 
opportunity we have at this point in our history to make sure we leave 
no veterans behind and keep faith with our veterans, address their 
needs in a

[[Page S1144]]

big and broad bill that reflects the urgent and diverse issues and 
challenges they face. I am proud to support it.
  I thank my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee who have 
approved many of the parts of this bill by unanimous vote or 
overwhelming bipartisan majorities. This cause should be truly 
bipartisan. Let's move forward and move America forward addressing the 
needs and challenges of its veterans as we have an obligation to do. We 
must keep faith with our veterans and leave no veterans behind.
  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                           HEALTH CARE REFORM

  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last week a letter was sent to majority 
leader Harry Reid and minority leader Nancy Pelosi of the House of 
Representatives, and I wish to read a few quotes from that letter. It 
says:

       When you and the President sought our support for the 
     Affordable Care Act, you pledged that if we liked the health 
     plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that promise is 
     under threat. Right now, unless you--

  Directed at the majority leader and the minority leader in the 
House--

     and the Obama Administration enact an equitable fix, the 
     ACA--

  Or the Affordable Care Act, which some people refer to as 
``ObamaCare''--

     will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but 
     destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the 
     backbone of the American middle class.

  The letter goes on to say:

       Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, we have been 
     bringing our deep concerns to the Administration, seeking 
     reasonable regulatory interpretations to the statute that 
     would help prevent the destruction of non-profit health 
     plans. As you both know first-hand, our persuasive arguments 
     have been disregarded and met with a stone wall by the White 
     House and by the pertinent agencies.

  This is a letter that was, as I said, sent last week to the leaders 
in the House and in the Senate. I wish to quote a few more passages 
from that letter.

       We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended 
     consequences of the Affordable Care Act are severe. Perverse 
     incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios.
       First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep 
     employees' work hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous 
     employers have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this 
     obligation, and many of them are doing so openly. The impact 
     is twofold: fewer hours means less pay while also losing our 
     current health benefits.

  The summary of the letter at the end says:

       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we 
     represent and the families they support, we can no longer 
     stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care 
     Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our 
     members along with millions of other hardworking Americans.

  So when we look at this letter and the tone of the letter and some of 
the statements made in the letter, we see that it talks about 
destroying the health benefits of employees. It talks about nightmare 
scenarios being created by perverse incentives in the Affordable Care 
Act. As I said before, it says the Affordable Care Act will shatter not 
only our hard-earned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the 
40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle class.
  If my colleagues are wondering who sent the letter--one might think 
it came from the National Federation of Independent Business or perhaps 
the National Association of Manufacturers, the chamber of commerce, or 
some business group that obviously has major concerns and issues with 
the implementation of ObamaCare. But that letter came from Mr. James 
Hoffa, who is the general president of the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters; it was cosigned by Joseph Hansen, the international 
president of the UFCW, and by D. Taylor, the president of UNITE-HERE--
three major union organizations that are very concerned

[[Page S5714]]

about ObamaCare and its implementation and what it is going to mean to 
the health care benefits many of their members already enjoy, as well 
as what it will do to wreck the 40-hour workweek that is, as they 
describe, the backbone of the American middle class.
  So the list goes on of those who have deep and abiding concerns about 
the adverse and harmful impacts of ObamaCare as we approach the 
implementation stage the first of next year.
  As we know, last week the administration announced they were going to 
delay the implementation of the employer mandate. I think many of us 
received that news as welcome news because we have argued that many of 
the penalties associated with the legislation and its implementation 
are going to be very harmful to job creation and to economic growth and 
that we are going to see more and more employers starting not only to 
not hire people but actually to reduce the size of the workforce. In 
fact, a survey of employers around the country suggested that 40 
percent of them were, in fact, doing that. They were not hiring new 
people. Also, 20 percent of the employers in this country were actually 
reducing--laying people off--because of the concerns about the mandates 
included in ObamaCare.
  So the administration reacted to that by saying: OK, we have been 
listening to you. We hear you. We are going to delay the employer 
mandate.
  That is the penalty attached if employers don't offer a government-
approved health plan with lots of bells and whistles and things in it--
things that they didn't believe they could afford. So we get the 1-year 
temporary relief from that.
  But I think the question that has to then be asked of the 
administration is this: If you are going to provide relief from the 
employer mandate, what about everybody else? What about all of the 
other Americans who are going to be impacted and harmed? What about the 
individual mandate where we have 6 million Americans who are, when it 
is fully implemented, going to be faced with a tax of about $1,200?
  We have all kinds of families across this country who are seeing, 
because of the higher taxes and many of the mandates associated with 
the legislation already, higher premiums. In fact, when the President 
took office, he promised he was going to reduce premiums for families 
in this country by $2,500. Well, according to the Kaiser study--and 
they track premiums--since the President has taken office, health 
insurance premiums for families in this country have actually increased 
by $2,500. So when the President made the argument that he would lower 
insurance premiums for families in this country by $2,500, just the 
opposite has happened. We have seen premiums actually go up. I think 
premiums are going to continue to go up as this becomes implemented and 
becomes, ultimately, the law of the land.
  A lot of my colleagues on the other side have said: Why do you guys 
keep complaining about this? It is the law of the land. In fact, it is 
the law of the land, which I think begs the question of, why is the 
administration not enforcing it? Why has the administration been 
delaying implementation of ObamaCare, at least as it pertains to the 
employer mandate?
  I think there are a lot of obvious reasons for that. They got tired 
of hearing about the adverse impacts it was having on the economy and 
having on jobs. We saw the jobs numbers from the month of June, and the 
number of people who have been pushed into part-time jobs was actually, 
in the month of June, up by 322,000 individuals.
  In other words, what we are seeing is that a lot of people who were 
previously full-time workers and who want to work full-time in our 
economy are being pushed into part-time jobs. Why is that happening? 
Well, at least one of the reasons, I would argue, is that under 
ObamaCare the requirements that apply to employers apply to full-time 
workers. So if an employer doesn't have full-time workers--and the law 
defines that as 30 hours a week--if an employer doesn't have people 
working more than 30 hours a week, they are not covered by the mandates 
in the legislation. So what are many employers doing? Many employers 
were then cutting the hours of their employees to get under that 30-
hour threshold so they wouldn't be hit with these costly new mandates.
  What does that mean for the average family in this country? It means 
that fewer and fewer people have full-time jobs, higher take-home pay, 
and more and more Americans are having to do part-time work--probably 
finding two part-time jobs to help pay the bills. That is a crushing 
effect on an economy that is already struggling to recover. A lot of 
people who I would argue want to get back into the workforce are trying 
to find full-time work and are being met with resistance from employers 
because employers are having to deal with these costly mandates 
included in the Affordable Care Act.
  So if we look at the effect, the net result so far of ObamaCare, 
which, again--we have mentioned this many times here--is 2,700 pages in 
terms of legislation and 20,000 pages of regulations--in fact, the size 
of the stack of regulations is now 7\1/2\ feet tall, so it is about a 
foot taller than I am. Just last week another 606 pages of regulations 
were issued in terms of the implementation of this law. Can we imagine 
average Americans trying to comply with 20,000 pages of regulations or, 
for that matter, businesses trying to comply with them?
  There is so much uncertainty associated with this law and the impact 
it is going to have and fears about the impact it is going to have, and 
nothing is being done to make that any easier for most Americans. It 
was made easier for employers last week when the penalty for the 
employer mandate was delayed by 1 year.
  We believe that if they are going to delay the employer mandate for a 
year, we ought to delay the implementation of this law for everybody 
and not just do it for a year. Let's do it permanently. Let's start 
over. Let's do this the right way. It didn't take a 2,700-page bill, it 
didn't take 20,000 pages of regulations, it didn't take a government 
takeover of one-sixth of our economy to try to solve the problems and 
the challenges we have in our health care system today. Yet that was 
the solution the President and our Democratic colleagues in Congress 
came up with. As a consequence, we have higher taxes, we have higher 
premiums, we have fewer jobs, and we have lower take-home pay for many 
Americans.
  I wish to point out in terms of the issue of premiums even the 
administration has acknowledged that some people are going to see their 
premiums rise under the health care reform law. There are estimates 
from the Society of Actuaries study that was released in 2013 that 
showed the State of Ohio's current average cost to cover medical 
expenses for an individual health insurance plan to be $223.
  Based on the proposals submitted to the Department, the average to 
cover those costs in 2014 under ObamaCare is going to be $420, 
representing an increase of 88 percent when compared to--this is a 
study of actuaries--their study. So an 88-percent increase in the State 
of Ohio. That, of course, again was in the individual health care 
market.
  There have been studies done that suggest that the Federal health 
care law, the Affordable Care Act or, as I said, ObamaCare could nearly 
triple premiums for some young and healthy men. The premium for a 
relatively bare bones policy for a 27-year-old male nonsmoker in the 
individual market would be nearly 190 percent higher.
  So I do not think many of the people who are going to be impacted 
have seen the full impact yet. But when it is fully implemented, there 
are going to be lots of other impacts on premiums, adverse impacts on 
people in this country, especially in the individual market. As I 
mentioned earlier, we have already seen significant increases in 
premiums with regard to families.
  So if we look at this thing and sort of assess where we are today, 
not too far, just a few months away from what is alleged to be the full 
implementation of this--of course, now with the exception of the 
employer mandate--I think we can come to one very simple conclusion; 
that is, that the result has led to fewer jobs, it has led to more 
people being pushed into part-time work as opposed to full-time jobs, 
and therefore lower take-home pay for middle-class Americans. It has 
led to higher premiums. We are already seeing the effect of that with 
regard to premiums that are being paid by families and those who have 
to buy their insurance in the individual marketplace.

[[Page S5715]]

  We know there are lots of higher taxes in the legislation. If we look 
at the impact on many people who provide health care services, the 
medical device manufacturers have a big tax they are dealing with, 
pharmaceutical companies, health insurance plans--we can go right down 
the list. All of those new taxes are going to get passed on, in many 
cases passed on to people who are not high-income earners but middle-
class Americans who are trying to keep their heads above water and keep 
health care coverage for their family.
  These are the real-world impacts of ObamaCare as we know it today. 
That is why I think we see, even organizations that are very 
sympathetic to the President, very sympathetic to his agenda, fans of 
his agenda, people who worked very hard to get him elected in office--
the labor unions in their letter make that argument, that they worked 
very hard. They walked the neighborhoods. They did all of the 
grassroots organizing that was necessary to get the President elected. 
Here they are reacting to the Affordable Care Act, to ObamaCare, in the 
same way I think most Americans are.
  That is why we consistently see public opinion polls that are very 
negative toward the law. In fact, there was a Rasmussen survey recently 
that said 55 percent of Americans disapprove of the law, 39 percent are 
in favor of it. But a significant and decisive majority of Americans 
believe this is going to be bad for them, bad for their own personal 
situation, finances, when it comes to covering their families but also 
bad for the economy and bad for jobs.
  Higher premiums, higher taxes, fewer jobs, more part-time jobs, fewer 
full-time jobs, lower take-home pay, that is what we today know as 
ObamaCare. There is a better way. We could go back and start over, do 
this the right way; step-by-step, incrementally, deal with the 
challenges that we have in our health care system, and there are many 
of them. But it did not take a massive takeover of one-sixth of the 
American economy, a massive new government program, 2,700 pages of 
legislation, over 20,000 pages of new regulations in terms of 
implementation to solve the challenges we have in our health care 
system today.
  There is a better way. I hope the feedback, if you will, the response 
that the President and his team are getting, not only now from those 
people who were opposed to it--many of us were arguing when this was 
being debated in the Senate that this, in fact, would be the impact. We 
talked about the impact on premiums because of the mandates and the new 
taxes. We talked about the taxes. We talked about the impact on the 
economy and jobs and pointed out that this was going to have an 
adverse, harmful impact on the ability of our economy to create jobs 
and to get that unemployment rate down and get people back to work in 
this country.
  Many of us were working those arguments. Many of the organizations 
that were opposed to the legislation were saying the same things. Now 
we have those who were actually endorsing and in favor of the 
legislation coming out and saying it would shatter not only our hard-
earned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work 
week that is the backbone of the American middle class. Perverse 
incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios.
  That is what is included in the letter that was submitted last week 
to the leaders in the Congress, written by major labor organizations in 
this country. Those are not rightwing conservatives, rightwing 
Republicans who are reacting this way to ObamaCare; these are allies of 
the President who have realized and come to the conclusion that this is 
incredibly problematic, not only for them and their members and the 
employees of a lot of companies out there with regard to the current 
health care benefits that they already have but also what it means for 
the 40-hour work week and what it means for the take-home pay for 
middle-class Americans across this country.
  We can do better. We should do better. It is not too late. It is 
never too late to do the right thing. I hope that as more and more of 
this anecdotal and empirical evidence comes forward about the 
implementation of this legislation, we will do that.
  I yield the floor.

     AMERICANS NEED A HEALTHCARE RULING ACT--INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LEONARD LANCE

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, December 2, 2011

  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, the United States Supreme Court's recent 
decision to hear arguments on the fate of President Obama's Affordable 
Care Act sets the stage for an important ruling next summer that I 
believe will bring much-needed regulatory certainty to our economy.
  However an obscure tax provision enacted into law by Congress in 1867 
could delay a final ruling on the constitutionality of health care 
reform until 2015.
  The court agreed to consider four key questions concerning the 
constitutionality of the health care law including whether Congress had 
the authority to require individuals to buy health insurance by 2014 or 
pay a tax penalty.
  Legal scholars differ over whether the health care law adds a ``tax'' 
for those who lack insurance or instead imposes a ``penalty'' that must 
be paid to the Internal Revenue Service.
  Yet under a law known as the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867, judges are 
barred from deciding on tax cases until the tax has been paid. 
Therefore if the justices find themselves closely divided on the issue 
the court could invoke the Anti-Injunction Act and put off a decision 
until 2015, when the first taxpayer pays a penalty for not having 
insurance.
  Waiting for a decision on the constitutionality of the health care 
law until 2015 could be disastrous for U.S. businesses and our economy 
by continuing to deny regulatory certainty in this area.
  That is why today I am introducing the Americans Need a Healthcare 
Ruling Act. This legislation would waive the Anti-Injunction Act as it 
applies to the Affordable Care Act. Passage of this bill will help 
ensure a decision on the issue next year.

  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. For the purpose of debate only, I yield 
the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), 
pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only.


                             General Leave

  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their 
remarks.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from South Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. House Resolution 679 provides for 
consideration of H.R. 436, a bill to repeal the 2.3 percent excise tax 
on medical devices enacted as part of the President's health care law. 
It also provides for a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 5882, 
the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act. The legislative branch 
appropriations rule is typically the only structured rule in the 
appropriations process, and we are continuing that bipartisan tradition 
here today.
  We are voting here today to stand up for more than 423,000 American 
employees and the health of millions that their work protects. A new 
$29 billion tax on medical devices, passed as part of the President's 
health care package, threatens to stifle innovation in the health care 
industry. If medical device manufacturers are punished with this new 
tax, we are all punished. Our health is punished. Our parents' health 
is punished. Our kids' health is punished.
  Yesterday, I talked with one of my constituents, Dan Denson, who owns 
a medical device company in Summerville, South Carolina. He shared two 
concrete examples of how this new tax will hurt his company, the health 
care industry, and most importantly, it will hurt those in need of 
medical care.
  For Dan's home health company the profit margin is about 10 percent. 
That profit is used to pay their employees, improve technology, and 
expand when it's needed. So if you cut into it by 2.3 percent, you're 
cutting into their ability to create better devices that then provide 
better care for patients.
  As Dan put it, ``I can assure you that any additional impact to our 
cash flow will reduce the money available for innovation.
  Dan also talked to me about his fellow medical device companies who 
make the hoses for oxygen tanks and other devices which make life 
bearable for so many Americans. They are absolutely dependent on these 
devices. And what happens when we add a 2.3 percent tax to these 
smaller companies? Well, these companies work on a margin of around 3 
percent. So you don't have to be a math major to figure out that when 
you have a 3 percent profit margin and you have a new 2.3 percent tax, 
you are pretty close to zero.
  You simply cannot afford to run a business in this environment. You 
certainly cannot start a new business in this environment. We're not 
only hurting our medical device companies, we're also discouraging new 
entrepreneurs and innovators from being able to enter the ring.
  I felt it was so important to share Dan's thoughts today, as it shows 
in clear terms how this new tax will not only affect Americans' 
wallets, but it could impact the health of Americans in this country.

                              {time}  1240

  If our medical device manufacturers cannot continue to adapt and move 
forward with new and better technologies, our medical care system will 
slow down right alongside it.
  Because of innovation, life expectancy in the United States has 
increased by more than 3 years from 1986 to 2000, and the burden of 
chronic diseases representing more than 70 percent of the overall 
health care cost has been reduced. This tax affects devices ranging 
from cardiac defibrillators to artificial joints to MRI scanners, or, 
in plainer terms, the very devices that identify and treat patients in 
their time of need, and even those devices that could save lives. These 
days, technology is improving every single day.
  Why in the world would we want to put our innovators at a 
disadvantage? Why in the world would we want to take another $29 
billion worth of investments out of our future, out of our health care 
industry and put it in the hands of this government? There's no good 
answer to these questions, and there's no good reason for another new 
tax.
  Once again, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the 
underlying legislation. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on 
the rule and ``yes'' on the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule for the 
underlying bills H.R. 436, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, and H.R. 
5882, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2013. 
Frankly, I'm disappointed that the House Republicans continue to bring 
bills to the House under a closed process that restricts debate and 
discussion and doesn't allow amendments that could improve the 
underlying legislation and help forge a strong bipartisan majority.
  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans started this Congress with cries to 
repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and yet here we are a year 
and a half later, this body has voted several times to repeal the bill, 
but we've yet to see any plans to replace it. And here we are again 
with another bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. As far as I can 
tell, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not presented a 
plan to reduce rising health care costs, to provide health care 
insurance to 30 million uninsured Americans.
  This body, and those who advocate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, 
it should be incumbent upon them to talk about what we should replace 
it with to prevent the rising cost of health care from being an 
increasing burden on American businesses and American families. The 
motivations for repealing the Affordable Care Act are weaker and more 
blatantly political than ever, especially after several votes of this 
body to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  There are many provisions of the Affordable Care Act that the 
American people broadly support, including young adults staying on 
their parents' health insurance until they're 26, including creation of 
exchanges. Seniors throughout the United States are already benefiting 
from the Affordable Care Act's elimination of the Medicare prescription 
drug doughnut hole. In fact, in 2011, over 5.1 million Medicare 
beneficiaries saved over $3.2 billion on prescription drugs thanks to 
the Affordable Care Act.
  States across the country, including my home State of Colorado, are 
enthusiastically implementing health insurance exchanges in a 
bipartisan way that will help us reduce health care costs and expand 
access to high quality, affordable health care. So why are we still 
here talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act instead of 
focusing on areas where we share common ground?
  Unfortunately, the Protect Medical Innovation Act has been brought 
under a closed process which prohibits Members from being able to offer 
any amendments to this collection of four different bills. If my 
colleagues made an effort to compromise on health care proposals, there 
might actually be a chance to see legislation pass both Chambers with 
broad bipartisan support and signed by the President. This specific 
bill already has a veto threat from the President, and none of my 
colleagues on my side of the aisle were consulted with regard to a 
method of paying for this particular set of changes.

[[Page H3591]]

  Instead, the Republicans have chosen to cobble together three 
unrelated bills that do three totally different things, along with a 
very partisan offset with no opportunity to revise these bills; no 
opportunity for us to do our job as legislators, to amend these bills; 
no opportunity for us to work to forge a majority around commonsense 
proposals that can improve health care and create jobs.
  Let's take a look at what's in this diverse package of bills.
  Now, the original Protect Medical Innovation Act, that was the 
original bill before these three other bills were added and before this 
payment mechanism was added, would've repealed the excise tax on the 
manufacture or import of certain medical devices, one of the methods of 
funding the Affordable Care Act.
  Now a solid group of Members support repealing the tax. In fact, this 
tax impacts companies in my district like ZOLL Data Systems. And I hope 
we can have a straight up-or-down vote on this particular provision of 
this bill. But instead, it has been cobbled together with two unrelated 
bills and an unrelated method of paying for it.
  Similarly, there's solid support for two other pieces of legislation 
that are contained in this bill. One bill would have repealed the 
Affordable Care Act's prohibition on using HSAs and FSAs to purchase 
over-the-counter drugs, and another would have allowed individuals with 
FSAs to redeem money left in their accounts at the end of the year.
  Now, we all have our different opinions about these bills. I 
personally support allowing HSAs and FSAs to purchase over-the-counter 
drugs, and I personally oppose the FSA measure because I think that 
people should be able to spend the money that's left in their FSAs by 
the end of year; otherwise, what's the purpose of an FSA? It kind of 
ceases to exist and simply becomes a tax shelter if it's not dedicated 
to health.
  But the fact of the matter is, under this rule, no Members of this 
body will be able to express their support or opposition to any of 
these bills in particular because they've all been cobbled together 
into an incoherent mess of a bill which this rule is trying to jam down 
the throat of this body. We should have brought up these bills one at a 
time and found a reasonable offset. Instead, the Republicans have 
chosen to place the burden of paying for this cluster of bills on the 
backs of middle class American families.
  Now, there's a number of alternative ways that we could have paid for 
these bills. The most obvious one would have been repealing oil and gas 
subsidies. This was an offset that was included in the Democratic 
substitute which the majority failed to even allow to come up for a 
vote by this body. That offset would have provided $32 billion in 
reductions of oil and gas subsidies over 10 years, making sure that the 
government doesn't pick winners and losers in the energy space, 
allowing oil and gas to compete on a level playing field with all other 
energy resources instead of being designated as a recipient of taxpayer 
money and government subsidies. Now, that particular offset would have 
not only paid for eliminating the medical device tax, but also reduced 
our deficit by $3 billion.
  Today I introduced a bill, H.R. 5906, which would repeal the medical 
device tax and replace those lost revenues by eliminating tax loopholes 
and subsidies for oil and gas companies. Personally, I'm supportive of 
other ways of paying for the medical device tax as well. Let us work 
together to find a way to pay for any changes in the Affordable Care 
Act that don't fall squarely on the back of middle class American 
families.
  However, Mr. Speaker, instead of a thoughtful offset, the Republicans 
have chosen to dig into the pockets of low- and middle-income Americans 
to pay for this bill. So let's look at how this bill would affect 
American families.
  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this proposal would 
force 350,000 people to lose their health care insurance. Yes, that's 
350,000 people less that would have health care insurance.
  Now, how devastating and misguided is this? Let's take an example. 
Let's take a hypothetical family of four in Colorado, in Ohio, in 
Florida, in Pennsylvania. Let's say their household income is $36,000 a 
year. They're working hard to stay in that middle class. It's getting 
harder and harder. The family income, $36,000 a year; father and a 
mother. The mother has been out of work for 3 years. The total family 
cost of health care insurance is $12,000. Now, let's say the mother 
finds a job midway through the year. She's able to go back to work and 
she earns an additional $36,000 for her family, bringing that family of 
four's earnings to $72,000. They're fighting hard to stay in that 
middle class to afford their kids' college education. Now, under this 
bill, at the end of the year, that family is sent an additional health 
care bill for $5,160, a tax increase of over $5,000 for that middle 
class American family. Now, that's more likely to make it less of an 
incentive for that woman to get the extra job. What's the extra 
incentive to work if the government is going to stick you with a huge 
tax bill just for trying to support your family?
  Let's take another example. A family of four in Michigan, in Nevada, 
a father and mother with two young children. Let's say that the mother 
doesn't work outside the home. They're earning $36,000 a year and the 
family is struck with tragedy. The mother passes on early in the year 
leaving the father to support the kids. He takes a second job, as any 
good father would do, and is able to earn an additional $18,000 during 
the year working a 40-hour-a-week job and working a 20-hour-a-week job 
to put food on the table. Now, that increases that family's income to 
$54,000 from $36,000. And what does this Republican tax increase do? 
Well, it presents them at the end of the year with an additional $3,330 
tax increase, a $3,330 tax increase for a father who's just trying to 
put food on the table for his kids.

                              {time}  1250

  We can do better. The bill we are considering today would actually 
increase the tax hike on families by removing the restriction on the 
amount that families are required to pay. This has the perverse 
incentive of discouraging families from working and taking on 
additional jobs and working hard to get promoted. It takes away the 
incentive to perform well at your job and get a promotion or raise. 
Frankly, this payment mechanism encourages people to remain in poverty 
and on government assistance rather than striving to do better and earn 
more. This Republican bill punishes work, plain and simple, and is a 
huge tax increase on the middle class.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, if we want to repeal the medical device tax, let's 
discuss how to pay for it. If some people in this body think protecting 
subsidies for oil and gas companies is more important than getting rid 
of the medical device tax, well, fine, let's find another way to do it. 
But, unfortunately, this approach before us today isn't a serious 
approach to reducing the deficit. It's an approach that the President 
would veto, it's an approach that puts a huge tax burden squarely on 
the shoulders of working families in this country, and it doesn't help 
get Americans back to work.
  This proposal is based on politics, plain and simple, not on sound 
economic policies that are good for the middle class, good for the 
medical device industry, and good for America.
  This underlying rule also makes in order the Legislative Branch 
Appropriations Act for 2013. Now, that's an act that funds Congress 
itself and its supporting agencies. In these times of fiscal austerity, 
everyone--especially Members of Congress--should be tightening their 
belts.
  This bill provides a 1 percent reduction from last year's spending 
bill. Now, I am also heartened that it still ensures congressional 
support agencies have the sufficient funding they need to function so 
that we in this body can do our job.
  But even while the House's budget has been cut over 10 percent over 
the last 2 years, the House majority has chosen to spend scarce 
resources that the taxpayers have appropriated to us to defend the 
constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars gay and 
lesbian servicemembers, veterans and their spouses from securing the 
same benefits offered to straight military couples.
  As President Obama has determined, the law is simply indefensible 
constitutionally. And yet to date, this body, out of this bill, this 
Legislative appropriations bill, has spent three-quarters

[[Page H3592]]

of a million dollars of taxpayer money on fancy lawyers defending this 
discriminatory and offensive law. This waste of tax dollars is 
especially troubling given the recent First Circuit decision which 
found that DOMA is unconstitutional.
  Mr. Speaker, I can't support these underlying rules. It's beyond 
troubling to have a closed rule, not allowing amendments and thoughtful 
input from Members of both parties on four separate pieces of health 
care legislation that completely shuts out Republican ideas and 
Democratic ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act, improve job growth 
in this country, and help get our economy back on track.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I find it quite interesting 
and almost hilarious that my friend to the left would talk about tax 
increases when in fact embedded in this health care bill is $123 
billion in new taxes on property owners. Really? $123 billion of new 
taxes on property owners in addition to the $29 billion new tax they 
were talking about today, in addition to eliminating $500 billion from 
Medicare in order to fund this health care plan.
  I think the conversation about tax increases is a conversation we 
could spend a day on, and we'd be happy to have that conversation. But 
today, I'm going to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, 
Chairman Sessions.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, today, once again, we're on the floor of 
the House of Representatives with our friends on the other side of the 
aisle arguing about how we tax the American people, how if we're going 
to take this tax out we've got to replace it with another tax. Good 
gosh, aren't energy prices high enough already? Why do we want to pass 
that on to consumers and make gasoline more expensive? It does not make 
sense, and that's why we are here today to repeal a tax.
  Mr. Speaker, what is the tax we're talking about? It is a tax on 
business, on high tech. It is on medical devices that have allowed 
America to lead the world in solving problems, to give people medical 
devices, things that will make their lives even better.
  Mr. Speaker, I received a letter from Walter J. Humann, president and 
CEO, OsteoMed. He came and met with me at my office and then sent me a 
letter. Here's what Mr. Humann said--and I believe he represents not 
just the industry, but thousands of people, patients also who rely on 
high-tech and medical devices that would be without. He said:

       In addition to challenges with the FDA and reimbursement, 
     this 2.3 percent excise tax--which is on gross sales, whether 
     or not a business has any profits or not--will directly 
     impact our ability to create new jobs, invest in research and 
     development and effectively compete in a global marketplace.

  Further, he says:

       It should be noted that OsteoMed is also aggressively re-
     directing its business focus to international markets that 
     provide a less cumbersome and lengthy regulatory pathway with 
     revenue streams that are not subject to the medical device 
     tax . . . immediately saving 2.3 percent in the process. In 
     the past month, OsteoMed initiated the search for sales 
     managers in China and the Middle East to supplement recent 
     managers hired in Korea and Italy.

  Mr. Speaker, this is not just a tax. It is not just making it more 
difficult for employers to hire people. But it will stop America's 
innovative-ness to compete in the future.


                                                     OsteoMed,

                                        Addison, TX, June 5, 2012.
     Hon. Pete Sessions,
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative Sessions: Thank you for taking time to 
     visit with me last week regarding OsteoMed and my concerns 
     about the significant ``headwinds'' we face, especially 
     related to the 2.3% medical device tax that is scheduled for 
     implementation in 2013. On behalf of OsteoMed's 400 
     employees, I thank you for your support of H.R. 436, which 
     would repeal this onerous provision that otherwise will 
     negatively impact innovation and job creation at a time when 
     we can least afford it.
       As president & CEO of OsteoMed, a dynamic, 20 year old 
     surgical device manufacturing company based in your district, 
     I confront the challenges that America's innovators face 
     every day. In addition to challenges with the FDA and 
     reimbursement, this 2.3% excise tax--which is on gross sales, 
     whether or not a business has any profits--will directly 
     impact our ability to create new jobs, invest in research and 
     development and effectively compete in the global market.
       OsteoMed formed a new subsidiary company a couple of years 
     ago to develop an innovative spine product that greatly 
     simplifies spine fusion surgery and improves patient 
     outcomes. OsteoMed launched this product last year which 
     quickly grew to almost $5MM in sales in 2011 and currently 
     employs a number of highly skilled, high paid individuals. 
     Due to the significant upfront investment and on-going 
     development costs, this new company is not projected to make 
     a profit in the near future but is nevertheless subject to 
     the device tax which will further delay this subsidiary's 
     success. As a result, OsteoMed has now delayed additional new 
     product developments and personnel in order to make ``ends 
     meet'' and achieve the returns initially envisioned when this 
     company was created.
       OsteoMed's core business manufactures surgical implant 
     systems for use in craniofacial, neurosurgical and small bone 
     orthopedic (upper and lower extremities) surgeries. These 
     systems require extensive, specialized instruments that are 
     typically not sold, but are used to implant the devices that 
     drive OsteoMed's revenue stream. The device tax will not only 
     tax gross product revenues, but my understanding is it will 
     also tax the instruments OsteoMed must invest in and place 
     into hospitals at no charge thereby further reducing my 
     company's profit opportunities and forcing expense reductions 
     in other areas in order to achieve our profit goals.
       OsteoMed's products are sold through a variety of sales 
     channels and will require a new level of administrative 
     burden in order to track the ``gross'' revenues defined by 
     this tax. This requirement, along with the recent challenges 
     imposed by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, force 
     additional levels of administration and non value added 
     expenses that make OsteoMed less competitive and viable.
       The market in which OsteoMed competes is in turmoil and has 
     become increasingly competitive with many new offshore 
     competitors. As economics and recent government restrictions 
     have largely removed surgeons from the surgical device 
     purchase decision process, hospitals are now forcing 
     increasingly price concessions. Despite increased raw 
     material and labor costs, OsteoMed has been unable to raise 
     product prices over the past several years and is now equally 
     unlikely to simply pass along the device tax to our 
     customers.
       Like any other responsible business, OsteoMed must 
     carefully manage expenses in order to make profit and 
     continue to grow and succeed. In order to cover the shortfall 
     the new device tax will create, OsteoMed has already started 
     to implement cut backs in its operations including the delay/
     cancellation of new product development projects and the 
     hiring of additional personnel, including biomedical 
     engineering positions. It should be noted that OsteoMed is 
     also aggressively re-directing its business focus to 
     international markets that provide a less cumbersome and 
     lengthy regulatory pathway with revenue streams that are not 
     subject to the medical device tax. . . . immediately 
     ``saving'' 2.3% in the process. In the past month, OsteoMed 
     initiated the search for sales managers in China and the 
     Middle East to supplement recent managers hired in Korea and 
     Italy. Unfortunately, OsteoMed has already started to 
     effectively trade U.S. jobs for overseas positions as a 
     direct result of the medical device tax and other 
     governmental involvement.
       The medical device industry not only provides numerous 
     highly skilled and attractive jobs across the U.S., but it 
     also pays its workers on average 40% more than the typical 
     job. We are a vibrant sector of the economy and one of the 
     few remaining industries that produces a healthy export of 
     products. Tragically, this industry has now become the focus 
     of misguided and short-term government intervention and the 
     growth and continued prosperity of this proud American 
     industry now faces great hurdles.
       Again, I thank you for your service to our country and 
     specifically for your support of H.R. 436 to repeal this tax 
     and to help America's innovators continue to improve patient 
     care and drive job creation. I look forward to your ability 
     to visit OsteoMed when you are back in Dallas so you can see 
     firsthand our great employees and the innovative products 
     they produce to help people around the world. Please do not 
     hesitate to contact me to discuss this issue or any other 
     issues impacting the medical device industry.
           Sincerely,

                                             Walter J. Humann,

                                                  President & CEO,
                                                         OsteoMed.

  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire).
  Mr. ALTMIRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation 
we will be voting on this afternoon to repeal the $30 billion excise 
tax on medical device companies, and I'm proud to join Mr. Paulsen in 
his effort to prevent this misguided tax from taking effect next year.
  The district I represent in western Pennsylvania is home to a number 
of medical device companies that have planted their roots in our 
region. They offer high-paying, quality jobs and are developing 
innovative devices that are saving lives.

[[Page H3593]]

  One example is Zoll Medical, which manufactures the LifeVest, a 
lightweight, wearable defibrillator that continuously monitors a 
patient's heart. The device allows patients with medical conditions to 
return to their daily lives with the peace of mind that they are 
protected from sudden cardiac arrest. This is the type of innovation 
that we should be encouraging in this country, not penalizing.
  The excise tax is simply misguided policy. The American medical 
device industry has proven that when given the chance to succeed, it 
has the ability to produce devices that can better the quality of life 
for Americans and even save lives.
  The industry is already facing challenges from foreign competitors 
that have an easier time getting their products to market. We must give 
the U.S. device manufacturers the opportunity to succeed, not punish 
them for being innovators and risk losing the incalculable 
contributions they pro.."

                             General Leave

  Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 436.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Michigan?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I come to the floor today in support of H.R. 436, the Health Care 
Cost Reduction Act of 2012.
  This bill would repeal two of the harmful tax hikes contained in the 
Democrats' health care law: the medical device tax and restrictions on 
using health-related savings accounts for over-the-counter medication.
  The legislation also includes a provision that will increase 
flexibility for health care consumers who use flexible spending 
arrangements. All are fully paid for by recouping overpayments of 
taxpayer-funded subsidies used to purchase health care in the 
government-run exchanges. Notably, every one of these provisions has 
bipartisan support.
  As a result of ObamaCare, beginning in 2013, a 2.3 percent tax will 
be imposed on the sale of medical devices by manufacturers or 
importers. This tax will increase the effective tax rate for many 
medical technology companies, threatening higher costs, job loss, and 
reduced investment here at home. One study predicts that as many as 
43,000 American jobs are at risk if this goes into place.
  A recent Washington Post piece by George Will reinforced the threat 
to job creation and investment, noting that Zimmer--based in Indiana--
is laying off 450 workers and taking a $50 million charge against 
earnings; Medtronic expects an annual charge against earnings of $175 
million; and ZOLL Medical Corporation's CEO, Rich Packer, says the tax 
will impact the company's investment in research and development, 
stating that means fewer jobs for engineers. Plain and simple, this tax 
hike is a job killer, and it must be repealed. I commend committee 
member Erik Paulsen for introducing this legislation.

[[Page H3602]]

  Another ObamaCare tax increase, the medicine-cabinet tax, imposes new 
restrictions on the purchase of over-the-counter medications through 
tax-advantaged accounts used to pay for health care-related needs. 
Because of the Democrats' health care law, patients must now get a 
prescription from a physician if they want to use these accounts to pay 
for over-the-counter medications. The ban affects everyday lives. It 
prevents a mom from using her FSA in the middle of the night to buy 
cough medicine for her sick child without a prescription. It also 
leaves doctors saddled with unnecessary appointments to get a 
prescription so that a parent can use their FSA to buy Claritin for 
their son's allergies.
  One study estimates that even eliminating half of these unnecessary 
appointments could save patients time and the health care system more 
than 20 million visits each year, reaping a savings of more than $5 
billion. These new restrictions must be repealed, and I'm happy that 
the provision introduced by committee member Lynn Jenkins is being 
considered today.
  The last provision is a new approach that allows consumers the 
freedom and flexibility to keep more of their money. Under current law, 
employees' FSA balances must be spent by the end of the year or they 
will forfeit any unused balance back to their employers under the use-
it-or-lose-it rule. Such a rule encourages wasteful and needless 
spending at the end of the year. This legislation would allow 
participants to cash out up to $500 in FSA balances, and those funds 
would be treated as regular taxable wages.
  Allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in these 
difficult times is a commonsense goal that should be widely supported. 
This provision, championed by Dr. Boustany, is a commonsense one; and I 
urge its passage.
  Finally, I would like to take just a moment to talk about the offset 
for this legislation, asking those who receive higher tax payer-funded 
premium subsidies than they are eligible to receive to repay all of the 
overpayment. Let me be clear: this is a bipartisan offset. Increasing 
the amount of overpayments to be repaid was a proposal first put 
forward by congressional Democrats in the 2010 Medicare doc-fix 
legislation which passed the Democrat-controlled House 409 2. Such an 
offset was used again when the House passed and the President signed 
the 1099 repeal last year and more than 70 Democrats supported that 
bill. In fact, Health and Human Services Secretary Sebelius said:

       Paying back subsidy overpayments makes it fairer for all 
     taxpayers.

  This legislation, and the provisions included here, are supported by 
job creators big and small, patient advocates, senior organizations, 
and physician groups. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting 
these groups by voting for the Health Care Cost Reduction Act.
  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This bill is mainly a smoke screen. It is an effort to cover up the 
failure, indeed the refusal, of Republicans to act on the key issue 
facing our Nation: jobs and economic growth.
  As ranking member, I sent a letter last Friday to Dave Camp, who 
chairs the committee with the jurisdiction over the bill before us 
today, urging action on six major jobs bills within the committee's 
jurisdiction: extension of the section 48(c) advanced energy 
manufacturing credit; extension of the production tax credit for wind 
power and other vital advanced-energy incentives; extension of the 
highly successful build America bonds program, which financed more than 
$180 billion in infrastructure investment; extension of the 100 percent 
bonus depreciation; creation of a 10 percent income tax credit for 
small businesses that do create new jobs or increase their payroll; an 
extension of a jobs-related expired provision, such as the R tax 
credit.
  The answer: silence and continued inaction by Republicans in this 
House.
  Another bill over which the committee has jurisdiction, the highway 
bill, remains unacted upon. That bill would mean millions of jobs. No 
action. The Republican House message on the highway bill is: our way or 
the highway. And that means no highways.
  It is June. There is now the likelihood of no action or none before 
the construction season is over in numerous States. That inaction is 
not an accident. It is deliberate. It is implementing the goal stated 
20 months ago by the Senate Republican leader:

       ``The single most important thing we want to achieve is for 
     President Obama to be a one-term President.''

  It is reflected in the recent interview by the House Republican 
leader. Mr. Cantor said the rest of the year will likely be about 
``sending signals, we have huge problems to deal with.''
  Sending signals? The American people don't need and want signals. 
They need for us to take action to strengthen the economic recovery.
  We will hear today Republican efforts to describe the bill before us 
to repeal the tax on medical devices as a jobs bill. What it really is 
is another Republican effort to repeal health care reform, step by 
step, costing, in this case, $29 billion.
  We Democrats want more Americans to have access to medical devices. 
Health care reform helps do this by expanding insurance coverage to 
over 30 million individuals, which indeed will help the growth of and 
the innovation in the medical device industry. And as was true for 
other health groups benefiting from increases in health coverage, the 
medical device industry was asked to help to pay for health care reform 
so it would be fully paid for, not add to the deficit, as so many 
Republican measures, but it would be fully paid for.

                              {time}  1440

  They signed a letter with others pledging:

       ``We, as stakeholder representatives, are committed to 
     doing our part to make reform a reality in order to make the 
     system more affordable and effective for patients and 
     purchasers. We stand ready to work with you to accomplish 
     this goal.''

  The first signature on that letter is from and by the President and 
CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association.
  Now the Republicans are attempting to give that industry a free 
pass--a free pass--contrary to their stated commitment. The industry 
has not proposed any alternative whatsoever to meet that obligation 
reflected in the letter they signed. There is an effort here to cast 
repeal of the tax as a small business bill.
  The 10 largest companies in this submarket would pay 86 percent of 
the taxes relating to nondiagnostic devices. According to CRS, the 10 
largest companies that manufacture medical devices had total 
companywide profits on all their lines of businesses, both devices and 
other products, of $42 billion in 2010, including companies mentioned 
here, and $48 billion in 2011, and these companies had gross revenues 
from the sale of medical devices in 2010 of $133 billion.
  There was an effort here also to cast the bill as an effort to stop 
offshoring, but this point needs to be made. It's a fact: The tax 
applies to all covered devices, including those that are imported. So 
if anybody thinks they can just move overseas and bring it back here 
and not pay a tax, they're simply incorrect.
  The effort to cast this as a jobs bill involved allegations repeated 
here during the debate on the rule, which were analyzed by a neutral 
source and found to be simply erroneous. A Bloomberg group analysis 
made that clear: ``The study used by Republicans cites no evidence for 
the job loss claim.''
  Further, the study's assumptions, ``conflict with economic research, 
overstate companies' incentives to move jobs offshore, and ignore the 
positive effect of new demand'' created by the health care reform law.
  Before Rules yesterday, I asked that my substitute be placed in order 
to allow debate on two real jobs initiatives mentioned in my letter to 
you, Chairman Camp: a tax credit for employers that expand their 
payrolls, and an extension of bonus depreciation. Those two provisions 
would help create hundreds of thousands of jobs, not speculation, but 
real, including in small businesses. This has not been allowed.
  So we have open rules, as we have seen the last few days on some 
bills, that often mainly result in numerous amendments, shifting some 
monies from one place to another in an agency, not often helping to 
create a single job, but a closed rule when it comes to

[[Page H3603]]

bringing up provisions helping to create American jobs and economic 
growth.
  This is further evidence of what is really going on here in this 
Congress, a deliberate effort now increasingly undisguised to close the 
door on action to engender job creation and economic growth before the 
election.
  November 6 is what is driving the Republican Congress. Politics, not 
people. That is only not cynical, it is, indeed, pernicious. We owe it 
to the American people to blow the whistle on this. Too much, indeed, 
is at stake.

                                  National Women's Law Center,

                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2012.
     Re Vote No on Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2011, H.R. 
         436.

       Dear Representative: The National Women's Law Center writes 
     in strong opposition to H.R. 436, the Protect Medical 
     Innovation Act of 2011, because it would undermine a critical 
     protection in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and reduce 
     financial security for women and families. The bill would pay 
     for the elimination of the modest excise tax on medical 
     devices and other revenue provisions of the ACA by increasing 
     the tax liability of individuals and families receiving 
     premium tax credits through the new insurance exchanges.
       The modest excise tax on medical devices is a fair way to 
     raise revenue to help finance affordable health care coverage 
     for millions of Americans. The expansion of health care 
     coverage will benefit a wide range of health-related 
     industries, including the medical device industry, by 
     increasing demand for their products. Other industries in the 
     health sector are contributing to financing an expansion from 
     which they will profit; it is entirely appropriate to require 
     the medical device industry to make a contribution as well. 
     The tax will have minimal impact on consumers, because it 
     does not apply to medical devices that consumers buy at 
     retail, such as eyeglasses or hearing aids, and spending on 
     taxable medical devices represents less than one percent of 
     total personal health expenditures. And the tax will not 
     encourage manufacturers to shift production overseas: it 
     applies equally to imported and domestically produced 
     devices, and devices produced in the United States for export 
     are not subject to the tax. Repealing this tax and forgoing 
     $29 billion in needed revenues would be irresponsible--even 
     without the outrageous step of imposing this cost directly on 
     Americans without access to affordable health care coverage.
       Increasing the tax liability of individuals and families 
     receiving premium tax credits for health insurance coverage 
     is unfair and would reduce coverage for hundreds of thousands 
     of Americans. The ACA provides premium tax credits to 
     families with household income at or below 400 percent of 
     poverty who enroll in coverage through an exchange. An 
     advance payment of the premium tax credit will go directly to 
     insurance companies so that the monthly insurance premium 
     paid by families is reduced, thereby making health coverage 
     more affordable for millions of families. However, there is a 
     ``reconciliation'' at the end of the year when a family files 
     taxes to ensure that the right amount of credit was paid to 
     the insurer on the family's behalf. The ``reconciliation'' is 
     based on actual household income for the year, while the 
     advance payment is based on a projection that could be based 
     on current income or past tax returns. The ACA included an 
     important protection by including a cap on the amount of 
     repayment penalty a family would have to pay based on 
     ``reconciliation.''
       The proposal expected this week would entirely eliminate 
     this protection, leaving families vulnerable to an 
     unaffordable tax bill. Many families will be discouraged from 
     enrolling in coverage because of the potential tax liability 
     at the end of the year. Much of the savings from the proposal 
     are achieved because hundreds of thousands of people are 
     expected to refuse coverage if the cap is eliminated. Women 
     will be particularly affected by the elimination of the cap. 
     Women have lower incomes than men and experience larger 
     income variability from one year to another. This suggests 
     women will be more at risk for repayment penalties. Women 
     also often make the health care decisions for the family and 
     will be faced with the difficult decision of enrolling in 
     affordable coverage or forgoing that coverage because of a 
     potential tax penalty.
       The cap on the repayment penalty has already been 
     increased. Eliminating the cap would eliminate all 
     protections for families that are doing their best to provide 
     the right information to the exchange but face mid-year 
     changes in income or family size. A server in a restaurant 
     could gain new shifts or be promoted to manager. An employer 
     may give unexpected bonuses in December. A couple could get 
     married mid-year without fully understanding the impact on 
     household income and poverty level. The cap on the repayment 
     penalty needs to remain in place in order to protect families 
     and provide the stability promised in the ACA.
       We urge you to protect the security of families and the 
     revenue provisions of the Affordable Care Act so millions of 
     Americans can receive affordable health care by voting no on 
     H.R. 436 and any proposal to eliminate the cap on the 
     repayment penalty.
           Very truly yours,
     Judy Waxman,
       Vice President, Health and Reproductive Rights.
     Joan Entmacher,
       Vice President, Family Economic Security.

                                               ConsumersUnion,

                                        Yonkers, NY, June 6, 2012.
     Hon. Pete Stark,
     U.S. House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Congressman Stark: Consumers Union, the advocacy arm 
     of Consumer Reports, urges you to oppose H.R. 436. This bill 
     would subject consumers seeking to afford health insurance to 
     unfair penalties in order to pay for repeal of the medical 
     device excise tax under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The 
     Congressional Budget Office estimates that repealing the 
     device tax would cost $29 billion dollars over the next ten 
     years. CU opposes measures that would undermine the 
     Affordable Care Act's financing and thus jeopardize the 
     expansion of health insurance coverage to currently uninsured 
     or underinsured individuals.
       Proponents of the device tax repeal argue that it would 
     hinder the device industry's competitiveness and ultimately 
     force manufacturers to move jobs overseas. But the excise tax 
     was structured in such a way as to avoid this result. The 2.3 
     percent excise tax applies to imported as well as 
     domestically manufactured devices but does NOT apply to 
     exports. Thus, it should not disadvantage American 
     manufacturers trying to sell products abroad. Nor would it 
     disadvantage domestically produced products sold in the US, 
     as foreign competitors are subject to the same tax.
       When fully implemented the ACA is expected to create 30 
     million newly insured consumers in the health sector. The 
     Affordable Care Act finances the expansion of coverage by a 
     range of payment modifications to other sectors of the health 
     industry. The medical device industry also stands to gain 
     from the increased demand for medical devices that a large 
     newly insured population will bring. The device tax does not 
     apply to devices that individuals can buy retail such as 
     hearing aids and eye glasses. The device industry makes the 
     case that many devices are used in acute care settings, where 
     care may be provided whether a person is insured or not. But 
     this would ignore the many devices that are used for joint 
     replacement, treatment of incontinence and other non acute 
     surgeries and treatments. It is only fair that the device 
     industry pays its share in exchange for significant new 
     revenue opportunities.
       Further, CU opposes the proposed offset for the 
     legislation, the elimination of caps on subsidy repayments 
     for individuals.
       Under the ACA, eligibility for tax credits subsidies to 
     purchase private plans through health exchanges will be based 
     on an individual's annual income, determined retrospectively 
     when taxes are filed. To ease the cash flow considerations 
     associated with purchasing coverage, these credits are 
     advanceable, meaning that families can receive an estimate of 
     their credit and use those funds to pay for coverage earlier 
     in the year. However, since many low- and middle-income 
     families experience income variation throughout the year due 
     to job changes, seasonal employment and the like, it may mean 
     that too much or too little credit was awarded during the 
     year.
       The law currently current caps the amount individuals must 
     pay back in the event of this circumstance. We believe that 
     the current cap structure strikes a balance between 
     discouraging individuals from abusing the system and taking 
     money to which they are not entitled and not penalizing 
     individuals for working hard to increase their family income 
     so as not to need a subsidy. Last year Congress lowered these 
     caps, exposing subsidy users to more liability. We fear 
     eliminating these caps would have a chilling effect on low 
     income family's willingness to use the subsidies to purchase 
     insurance.
       For these reasons Consumers Union urges you to reject H.R. 
     436. We look forward to working with you on more constructive 
     ways to improve the ACA in the future.
           Sincerely,

                                              DeAnn Friedholm,

                                                         Director,
                                               Health Care Reform.

  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to a distinguished 
member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Paulsen of Minnesota.
  Mr. PAULSEN. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank him for 
his leadership on the committee as well.
  Mr. Speaker and Members, the medical technology industry is one of 
America's greatest success stories. This is an industry that has led 
the global device industry for decades with life-improving, lifesaving 
technologies that help patients and literally save lives.
  This device industry employs 423,000 Americans across the country. 
Some of our States, like Minnesota, have a high propensity because we 
have a huge ecosystem of medical technology--35,000 jobs, alone, in my 
State.
  But all that will change, Mr. Speaker, unless we act to stop a new 
medical device, a new $29 million tax that is

[[Page H3604]]

going to be imposed in just a little over 6 months that was part of the 
President's new health care law. Now, this is an excise tax. It is not 
on profits. It is a tax that is going to be on revenue.
  What does that mean? Well, we all know the names of the big companies 
that are successful and do really well across the country and sell 
throughout the world.
  I will tell you this: almost every week I get a chance to tour a 
company that has five employees, that has 10 employees. You have never 
heard of these companies, but they are working on lifesaving and life-
improving technologies. They are doctors. They are engineers. They are 
entrepreneurs. They are innovators. This tax will change all that 
because it's estimated that this tax will cost 10 percent of the 
workforce.
  I talked to a company earlier this day, a CEO of a company earlier 
today, of a 13-year-old medical device company. It employs 1,500 
workers here in the United States, and he's consistently added 300 jobs 
a year for the last few years. He said, point blank, if this tax goes 
into effect, it will cost the company $14 million. That means 200 
people less will be hired this next year.
  Mr. Speaker, what is worse to point out, companies are already 
preparing right now for the impact of this tax. Companies are already 
laying off employees. We have heard of companies in Michigan that are 
laying off 5 percent of their workforce in anticipation of the tax. So, 
Mr. Speaker, jobs are clearly at risk.
  And this will especially hit startup companies hard, companies that 
are not yet profitable, because this is a tax on revenue, not on 
profits.
  We have a chance and an opportunity to stop this tax dead in its 
tracks because it's an opportunity to protect jobs. We passed the bill 
in committee just a week ago, under the chairman's leadership, with 
bipartisan support. We have 240 coauthors of support for this 
legislation with bipartisan support. I anticipate we will be successful 
moving forward.
  I ask and urge support for the legislation.
  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from 
California, a senior member of our committee, Mr. Stark.
  (Mr. STARK asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. STARK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 436, one more piece of Republican 
legislation that protects special interests at the expense of working 
with families. This is just another message in an attempt to undercut 
the Affordable Care Act. It repeals a small excise tax imposed on the 
medical device industry as their contribution to health reform in light 
of their expanded market.
  I might remind you that repealing this tax costs $29 billion in 
deficit losses.

                              {time}  1450

  How do they finance this legislation? Like they always do--take it 
out of the hides of low- and middle-income working families and give it 
to rich manufacturers.

 HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will 
resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1926, which the 
clerk will report.
  The bill clerk read as follows:

       Motion to proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 294, 
     S. 1926, a bill to delay the implementation of certain 
     provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act 
     of 2012 and to reform the National Association of Registered 
     Agents and Brokers, and for other purposes.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.
  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak for up to 10 minutes. I 
think we are in morning business.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is moving to proceed to consider S. 
1926.
  Ms. LANDRIEU. Wonderful. I thank the Presiding Officer. I will then 
speak on the bill that is before us.
  I appreciate the cooperation of so many Members who voted last night 
to move forward on the debate of the fix to Biggert-Waters. We had a 
very strong and very impressive vote. I think 83 Members, Republicans 
and Democrats, came together from all parts of the country, from all 
different areas and districts and backgrounds to vote to move forward 
on the debate on flood insurance. I am grateful.
  We have been working on this for about a year and a half. It has been 
a tough slog because 2 years ago a bill called Biggert-Waters was 
passed, named after the two cosponsors in the House, Congresswoman 
Biggert and Congresswoman Waters. They passed a bill with very good 
intentions. They were thinking they were going to strengthen the flood 
insurance program. The bill had wonderful intentions, but 
unfortunately, the way it was drafted in the conference committee has 
resulted in disastrous results.
  Some of us knew that 2 years ago and started working literally the 
moment the conference bill was passed to begin changing it. So we have 
worked diligently and together and built a great coalition. I thank the 
200 organizations that quickly came together over the last year and a 
half--as quickly as any of these things can happen in a practical 
sense--to understand what went wrong in the first bill and how we could 
fix it so we could accomplish two important goals for the National 
Flood Insurance Program: first, that the program could be self-
sustaining. In other words, it could pay for itself with limited or 
minimal taxpayer burden.
  The other equally important goal--and the Presiding Officer, who 
represents New Jersey, knows, as I do, how important this is--is that 
the program would be affordable to middle-class families. If it is not 
affordable to middle-class families, they will not participate in it 
and the program will go bankrupt due to lack of participation.
  The idea of insurance is to have a large pool to spread the risk, and 
that is how an insurance system works. If we don't fix it, it is going 
to make that pool get smaller and smaller and smaller. Because people 
will not be able to afford it, the program will collapse and the 
taxpayers will be saddled with debt.
  The goal of our coalition--led by Senator Menendez, the senior 
Senator from New Jersey who is on the Banking Committee and has been 
one of the great spokesmen and leaders for this bill, and Senator 
Isakson from Georgia, who is literally the most respected Member in 
this whole body on issues related to real estate because he had one of 
the largest real estate companies in Atlanta and knows the issue well. 
He is very respected on both sides of the aisle. These two gentlemen 
have led this effort and have built a bipartisan coalition.
  So we are now ready this week, of all weeks. It is the State of the 
Union week. We would have probably preferred another week, but that is 
how this worked out. We are ready to debate the bill on the floor of 
the Senate. At last count, when we left, there were about six or seven 
relevant amendments. We are only going to accept relevant amendments to 
this bill. We are not going to accept amendments on other subjects by 
Members who are attempting to derail the Senate, get us off topic, et 
cetera, et cetera. We will only accept relevant amendments to this 
bill.
  The happy thing is we think we only have about seven or eight 
amendments. Some amendments are Republican, some amendments are 
Democratic.
  We just received an amendment from one of the opponents of our bill, 
the good Senator from Pennsylvania, who has not been supportive of our 
bill and

[[Page S496]]

has not worked with the coalition and has not cooperated in any way. We 
got his amendment an hour ago. We have been actually waiting for a year 
and a half.
  Last May he opposed the bill, and we couldn't even get to the debate 
because he wasn't happy with the direction we were going. So that 
happened in May. What is this month? It is January. We are now in the 
month of January, and he opposed the bill in May. It set us back 7 
months. We tried to explain to the Senator from Pennsylvania that 
74,000 people in his State have these policies and they too need help. 
Whether he has been able to reconcile that with his constituents I 
don't know, but we literally asked him to please let us know what we 
could do. We told him we would be happy to meet with him. The 
homebuilders and the realtors were willing to sit down and speak to 
him. We finally got a draft of his amendment in the last hour. We are 
literally reading it for the first time. I don't think that is 
cooperation, but he may have a different definition of it. We are 
reading that amendment now. I don't believe this amendment is going to 
help our cause. I think it is going to undermine what we are trying to 
do.
  I will have more comments about the specifics of it, but the Senator 
from Pennsylvania, for whatever reason, has not been cooperative the 
whole time. We will be happy to vote on his amendment. I think the 
amendment is going to do great harm to the bill, and I think I would 
urge our coalition at this point to vote no, but I am going to look at 
it.
  Senator Isakson has just received a copy of it in the last hour, and 
all I can do is ask our colleagues to be patient while we review his 
13-page amendment. We have 200 organizations that have been working on 
this. We are trying to be fair and get their input, and then we will 
know how to proceed.

  The bottom line is this: This week we are going to pass a flood 
insurance relief bill off the floor of the Senate. I wish to put 
everybody on notice that we have run out of patience. We have been 
working on this for a year and a half. We were told before Christmas we 
could have a vote, and then we were told we could have a vote when we 
got back. Then we were told we could have a vote before we left.
  This is it. There is no more time. We are voting on this legislation 
this week. We are either going to do it the easy way or the hard way. 
We are either going to have a few amendments the Republicans put up, 
the Democrats put up, and we get back to legislating as we should or 
the leader is going to file cloture on this bill and we are going to 
pass it without an amendment. If one single Republican comes to this 
floor and says they did not have time to discuss their amendment, we 
will debate until the cows come home because I am not leaving this 
floor until every single person in America knows the games that can be 
played here.
  I have been more than transparent. I have been more than honest. I 
have come here more than any Senator. I don't know if this is good or 
bad; it is the only way I know how to lead, which is to be forthright 
and honest with myself, with my constituents, and with people who need 
to know what in the heck is going on. I don't know how else to do it. I 
am not going to apologize. I am not going to read about how to do this 
in a book. There are no books on this. This is about leadership from 
the inside, and the only people who taught me this were my parents.
  I am just saying, if anyone in this Chamber thinks they are going to 
get away with trying to give some flimsy-limsy excuse about how they 
didn't get their amendment considered, how they are upset with the 
leader, they will have to go through me, and I am not moving because I 
have people all over this country who are desperate. We passed the 
wrong bill. We should not have passed it. We must fix it, and we are 
going to fix it this week in the Senate.
  What the House does, what Speaker Boehner does--he made some negative 
comments about the bill last week. My comments back were the Speaker 
has his hands full. He has been busy. I understand it. I wouldn't want 
his job. He has a tough job with a lot of issues to juggle. But I said, 
and I will say again, when this bill goes to the House, which it will 
after it passes the Senate this week, he will hear from millions and 
millions of Americans who paid their mortgage every month, who went to 
work every day, who honor their family by building homes in places they 
have been for generations, and they are about ready to take those 
front-door keys and turn them in to the local bank and walk away from 
their house. Speaker Boehner is going to hear that. I hope those words, 
those expressions, those pictures, those letters will hit his heart the 
way they have hit mine and that he will have a softened heart and an 
open mind and he will consider what we are trying to do.
  I realize our way may not be the most perfect way, but it is a good 
way, and if somebody wants to improve it, fine. But don't scuttle it, 
pretending to be helping. Don't scuttle it by pretending to be for some 
kind of better approach. If there was a better approach, we would have 
found it in the last year and a half we have been searching. We are not 
going to find it in the last 3 minutes of this debate.
  We are reviewing the Toomey amendment. He has been the lead opponent 
of our effort. I don't believe his amendment is helpful, but until I 
read it, I will not be able to give a definitive assessment. Senator 
Isakson will have to give his views on it, as will Senator Menendez, 
and we will figure it out. But we are going to bring relief to the 5 
million people who have done nothing wrong--middle-class families, some 
of them very poor families--who have been living in these places for 
generations, and because FEMA can't get its flood maps right, because 
FEMA can't get the affordability study done, they are going to be 
kicked out of their homes.
  Talk about misguided regulation. I hope Mitch McConnell, our 
Republican leader, talking about misguided regulation, will put a 
little muscle into helping us. He has been cooperative, and I thank 
him. Senator Reid has been putting a lot of muscle into this, and I 
thank him.
  I hope people will come to the floor and speak about the importance 
of this bill. We will figure out this amendment process--all germane 
amendments--and get the final vote this week. This is going to get done 
this week, the easy way or the hard way, and we are done. The vote is 
going to happen this week. We are going to move this bill from the 
floor to the President, who put out a statement--and his 
administration--they didn't have many positive things to say about 
this. Let me just say I think their statement is misinformed. It is 
misguided. I am hoping the White House will reconsider. The President 
is coming here tonight to speak about the importance of strengthening 
the middle class. I would think that allowing middle-class people to 
stay in their homes would be a good place to start. So I hope the 
administration will take a second look and join us and help us to let 
middle-class families stay in their homes.
  Let me conclude. Colorado is a beautiful State. I have been there 
many times. However, not everybody can live in the mountains of 
Colorado. There are some of us who have to live along rivers and 
streams and ports to build and to support the infrastructure that helps 
to make this country grow. My people who fish every day, who harvest 
the oysters, who put seafood on the table, who bring those huge and 
magnificent barges up and down the river, can't live in Vail, CO. I am 
sorry. They don't like the snow and they couldn't afford to live there 
anyway. They live in little places such as Burris and Venice and 
Plackman, and the lower ninth ward that got flooded out, every single 
home destroyed. They can go back if we use our science, our 
engineering, our brains, and lead with our hearts and our heads. This 
can work. But if people are playing political games, if they are trying 
to score political points or if they are not working hard enough to 
understand the issue, then I feel sorry for them because the public 
needs our help.
  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about

Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. This bill is a bill that 
is designed to fix the damage that has been done by the Biggert-Waters 
Act, and this damage is extensive. This bill would freeze dramatic rate 
hikes, and these rate hikes have several impacts.
  We have, of course, the impact on families who currently have flood 
insurance who will be paying much higher levels than they bargained for 
when they bought their home and may not be able to afford those much 
higher levels, raising questions about their ability to stay in those 
homes.
  We have the impact on commercial enterprises and the fact that now 
that they are paying higher rates, they may not feel they can add on to 
their business in that location.
  Then we have the impact, of course, on selling your property, whether 
you are a homeowner or you are a business, because the folks who might 
be buying might have to jump to a full rate that would be many times--
in some cases 10 times--the price the current owner is paying, and when 
that happens the property becomes unaffordable and, therefore, the 
value that one has in their home or business drops dramatically.
  All of this is of great concern, and we need to reverse the features 
of Biggert-Waters that are causing this economic havoc.
  This bill comes out of discussions that were in my Subcommittee on 
Economic Policy several months ago. This discussion is now led by 
Senator Menendez, and he has been ably assisted and partnered with 
Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator Isakson and Senator Vitter and I 
compliment them all for being vocal advocates and instrumental in 
helping to move this bill forward.
  The Biggert-Waters Act, while well intentioned, is creating massive 
burdens for our middle-class homeowners in Oregon and certainly across 
the Nation. Flooding is something of an equal opportunity disaster. For 
some, it is the coastlines. For others, it is broad flood plains along 
major rivers. For others, it is narrow valleys and flash floods. But in 
all of these situations, the common impact is dramatic devastation.
  Something is very wrong though when families are more worried about 
dramatic spikes in their flood insurance premiums than they are worried 
about dramatic floods, and that is where my Oregon families are right 
now. I wish to share a letter from Kelly. She lives in Tigard. She 
says, in her own words, she is ``a middle class, single mother 
currently working to get [her] daughter through college.''
  She bought her home 13 years ago to provide stability for her 
daughter. This is a goal of so many parents, to have a piece of the 
American dream, to have the stability that goes with home ownership, to 
have the equity that you build in your home as a financial reservoir 
with which to assist your children going forward in life.
  She thought about selling a few years ago but decided to stay in that 
house and keep that financial foundation. But now, with Biggert-Waters 
going into effect, she has been caught between two bad choices. If she 
stays in her home, her flood insurance rates will go up precipitously, 
making her home increasingly unaffordable and squeezing an already 
tight budget. But should she try to sell, the new owner will face 
annual flood insurance premiums of $15,000 or more, making her home 
completely unaffordable for middle-class buyers.
  Keep this in mind: For every $1,000 a buyer pays in flood insurance 
per year, the value of a home drops by about $20,000. So if the flood 
insurance is $15,000, we are talking about a value of a home dropping 
$300,000. Many middle-class homes in Oregon are not priced at $300,000. 
They might be valued at $200,000 or $220,000 or $250,000 or, in more 
rural areas, $150,000 or $175,000. So we can wipe out the complete 
value of a home and certainly easily wipe out the equity a homeowner 
has built over a number of years. Essentially, you have to give the 
home away. That makes no sense.
  To read from Kelly's letter, she says:

       Here is where I see a problem. There is an old saying, 
     ``you can't get blood from a stone.''

  She continues:

       I know I am not alone in my predicament of barely getting 
     by financially.
       Middle income folks like me are squeezed from all sides. . 
     . .
       While living expenses rise every year, our income generally 
     does not raise enough to make up for it. . . .
       We tighten our belts and wait for better times. So, the 
     problem here is, we can't afford to pay these, much higher 
     rates. We just don't have the money.

  She continues in her analysis:

       There are options, of course. We can come up with many 10's 
     of thousands of dollars to raise our houses up and make them 
     flood friendly. . . .
       But wait--we don't have 10's of thousands of dollars. And, 
     we can't sell--that's the beauty here. Who will buy a small, 
     middle income type home that has a flood insurance bill 
     annually of 15-30k [a year]?

  She continues:

       So what will we do, the over 1 million homeowners in this 
     situation? To our utter frustration and humiliation, many of 
     us have no choice but to walk away. . . .
       Whatever the attitudes about us are, most of us are good 
     Americans who believe in paying our debts. We have worked 
     hard our entire lives, and asked for little or no help along 
     the way.
       This will crush us, and since we don't have the money to 
     give, there is no benefit to be had.

  That is how she concludes her letter: ``This will crush us. . . . '' 
She is right. It will crush her family. It will crush millions of 
families across this country. It will include foreclosures. It will 
include equity wiped out. It will result in families having to walk 
away from their home and hope they are not pursued by their mortgage 
company that will be unable to sell the home on a secondary market for 
the debt owed and, therefore, could pursue the owners.
  It is wrong and counterproductive to squeeze middle-class homeowners 
such as Kelly when it will only result in more foreclosures or families 
trapped in their homes unable to sell them.
  Making flood insurance more solvent is a laudable goal, but it is one 
we have to approach in a manner that involves fairness over time. 
Achieving solvency by putting a huge burden, a huge financial shock on 
the backs of our middle-class families is not just wrong, it is a 
financial disaster that is unfolding now and will continue to unfold 
across this country.
  We cannot get to solvency by asking families to pay sums they simply 
do not have or, as Kelly said, ``You can't get blood from a stone.''
  We need to immediately stop these dramatic rate hikes for our 
homeowners and our businesses while FEMA goes back to the drawing board 
to figure out how to make this program affordable and effective for our 
middle-class families.
  That is exactly what this bill does. This bill has several important 
provisions that help ensure affordability and fairness for our middle-
class families.
  The first is it delays implementation of flood insurance rate 
increases. It does so on primary residences and on businesses until 
FEMA can complete an affordability study, propose regulations to 
address the problem of affordability, and give Congress time to weigh 
in.
  Second, unlike Biggert-Waters, the bill ensures that FEMA will truly 
have the funding they need to complete a comprehensive affordability 
study.
  Third, this bill takes on a catch-22 in the current system, which is 
that when homeowners face unaffordable rates that they think are 
inaccurate, they have to pay out of their pocket for a flood map appeal 
to prove that their premiums should be lowered. So when someone else 
makes a mistake, they have to pay for that mistake, and that is wrong.
  The studies necessary for an appeal can cost between $500 and $2,000. 
It is a prohibitive cost for many families to undertake. This bill 
ensures that any homeowner who can successfully appeal a flood map 
finding will be reimbursed by FEMA for their expense, making the system 
fairer for the homeowner and giving FEMA an added incentive to get it 
right.
  Finally, this bill does something very important in creating a flood 
insurance rate map advocate within FEMA, someone to educate and 
advocate for homeowners. One of the complaints my office has heard is 
that FEMA has not been responsive to homeowners' concerns or questions 
about changes in their policy.
  It creates this position. An advocate will do several things. The 
advocate will educate policyholders about their flood risks and their 
options in choosing a policy. The advocate will assist

[[Page S498]]

those who believe a flood map is wrong and assist them through the 
appeal process. The advocate will improve outreach and coordination 
with local officials, community leaders, and Congress.
  My colleagues Senators Hoeven and Heitkamp have also done great work 
on this bill to ensure that homeowners in certain communities are not 
hit by unfair rules on how their basements impact a flood policy.
  I would like to address one other issue that is not in this bill that 
hopefully I will be able to offer an amendment on; that is, protection 
for consumers whose policies are purchased by their mortgage servicer 
or their bank rather than by themselves. This is the issue of predatory 
force-placed premiums.
  Let me explain. Let's say, for example, that you are notified by your 
servicer that they have reviewed the records and they now consider you 
to be in a flood plain they had not noticed before and you have to get 
flood insurance. But that flood insurance, unsubsidized, is so 
expensive you cannot afford it. So then the servicer says: Well, we are 
going to put on flood insurance for you. The rate might be 5 to 10 
times the market rate. In other words, the homeowner who already cannot 
afford flood insurance is gouged by predatory premiums on force-placed 
insurance.
  Let's consider that perhaps you had a transition in your family. 
Maybe you have one partner paying the bills and another partner takes 
it over while the first partner is sick and you miss the fact that your 
annual premium was due on your flood insurance. So what happens? That 
lapse can trigger much higher rates that you cannot afford. Then 
suddenly you are in the situation of force-placed insurance.
  How about if new maps are issued. The new maps now put you into a 
100-year flood plain that you were not in previously. It is not that 
the geography changed; it is that a different set of engineers, doing a 
different study, different assumptions about where the rain will fail, 
which creek will swell the quickest, puts you into this 100-year flood 
plain.
  So now what are you going to do? You are going to be in this 
situation. You cannot afford that insurance, that newly placed 
requirement for insurance, so the servicer or bank puts it on for you. 
Well, they should put it in at a fair market rate, not at a rate which 
is 5 to 10 times the fair market rate and which is designed to gouge.
  I have an amendment that addresses this by saying the servicers or 
banks cannot take fees--or, as some would say, ``kickbacks''--for 
placing this insurance and therefore have an incentive to do a 
nonmarket rate policy that is 5 or 10 times higher than the actual 
market rate.
  This is a significant problem in force-placed home insurance. 
Certainly, we do not need to add to this problem by allowing predatory 
premiums on force-placed policies in the realm of flood insurance. I 
encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a look at 
this issue, to support banning the anticompetitive features of the 
market that have led to these predatory premiums on force-placed flood 
insurance.
  In closing, I again thank my colleagues who have worked so hard. This 
is an important issue, an incredibly important issue for families 
across Oregon. Let's stop these dramatic rate hikes. Let's work 
together for an affordable flood insurance program that will be 
effective and fair for all Americans.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Iowa.
  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in 
morning business for 20 minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                           Income Inequality

  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the letters I will be 
speaking about be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
  Recently the Obama administration has been talking a lot about income 
inequality and poverty. Yesterday I spoke about the issue, about the 
war on poverty, its successes and its failures. As I said yesterday, 
the United States has spent trillions of dollars in the last 50 years 
fighting the so-called war on poverty. I said yesterday that the 
results have been marginal, in some cases successful, reducing the 
poverty rate from 19 percent down to the 15 percent it is now. But a 
lot more needs to be done.
  Now, in the fight against the war on poverty, this administration, 
like a lot of administrations, wants to spend more money on more 
programs. Some of that may be justified, but that does not seem to fix 
the problems. If you just hand this money out with no strings and no 
oversight, it gets diverted and misused. That is the purpose of my 
speaking today on the subject of public housing.
  Wasted money does not help the poor. There are a lot of people who 
make a nice profit from the poverty of others. This administration has 
been helping a number of these profiteers while the poor suffer. I want 
to be clear as to some of these issues I am talking about--their 
genesis goes back to previous administrations as well. Through my 
oversight work, I have seen this happen over and over, that a few 
people profit from trying to help the poor, but the money does not go 
there. The Department of Housing and Urban Development hands out $4 
billion in Federal money every year to local housing authorities. This 
money is supposed to help provide clean, affordable, safe housing for 
the poor. But, while no one is watching, much of the money gets spent 
on high salaries and perks for the people who run the housing 
authorities. These housing authorities have other sources of money. For 
most of them, up to 90 percent of their total funding comes from the $4 
billion contributed by the Federal taxpayers.
  Housing and Urban Development argues that because housing authorities 
are State and local government entities, there is no reason to 
scrutinize them from here in Washington, DC. As far as I am concerned, 
HUD is missing the point for 4 billion reasons. Those are dollar 
reasons. Taxpayer money should come with Federal oversight. We need to 
make sure that the Federal authorities who disburse it make sure they 
oversee that it is spent in the legal way--to help the people who need 
the help.

  I have been conducting oversight of the wasteful spending at housing 
authorities for almost 4 years. I have been urging the Obama 
administration to look at what is happening and to take action. But 
there is little if any interest in the oversight of these Federal 
dollars by the folks writing the checks here in Washington, DC. They 
just want to send the checks and pat themselves on the back. They do 
not want to talk about what actually happens to the money once it is 
disbursed.
  Federal funds end up feathering the nests of local housing 
bureaucrats instead of housing the poor. I will show you how that is 
done. Here are some of the most egregious examples of how ineffective 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development has been at policing 
local housing authorities.
  Bradenton, FL, is an area of the country which was hit extremely hard 
during the foreclosure crisis, but employees at Bradenton Housing 
Authority only have to work 4 days a week. They get 2 weeks off at 
Christmas, bonuses in June and December, and the option to cash out up 
to a month of sick leave twice per year. They get free use of a car 
purchased by the housing authority. After 15 years of employment, they 
get to keep the car when they leave or take $10,000 instead; it is 
their choice.
  There are generous fringe benefits, but many housing authorities also 
provide very lucrative salaries. These salaries far exceed the salaries 
of Federal employees right here in Washington, DC, who hand out the 
taxpayers' money to the housing authorities. The biggest salary jackpot 
winner I have encountered so far is the Atlanta Housing Authority. At 
least 22 employees there earn between $150,000 and $303,000 per year. 
The Atlanta Housing Authority benefits from a special HUD designation 
called ``moving to work.'' That program exempts designated housing 
authorities from certain requirements, including salary justification. 
This is not just an isolated example. The executive director of the 
Raleigh, NC, housing authority receives about $280,000 in salary and 
benefits, plus up to 30 vacation days. He also accumulates comp time 
for any hours he works over 7\1/2\ hours per day. He has used over 20 
days of comp time per year since 2009. Add that to his regular vacation 
time, and he is out of the office

[[Page S499]]

nearly 3 months per year. Nine months of work for $280,000 is an 
annualized salary of $375,000 per year. Very few taxpayer-funded jobs 
pay anything close to that amount.
  So what is the justification for such high salaries, particularly 
considering the fact that they are supposed to provide safe, affordable 
housing for low-income people? After years of ignoring the issue, HUD 
finally capped Federal funding for executive salaries at $155,500 per 
employee. Of course, this was only after various local media and I 
exposed deep-rooted problems and pushed the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development to act. But now housing authority executives have 
turned to creative accounting tricks to get around that limit of 
$155,500 per employee. Since some of their money comes from other 
sources, the housing authorities simply claim that any salary over the 
Federal limit comes from one of those other sources, whereas the money 
from those other sources ought to be used to help low-income people 
have affordable, clean, and safe housing.
  Because of my oversight letters on this subject, HUD recently 
notified the housing authorities that they must document the original 
source of the funding used to pay salaries over the Federal limit. That 
is good news, but there are still larger problems. The De.."

                           HEALTH CARE COSTS

  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come here to speak about a couple items. 
We are now in a second-day delay as the majority leader and his caucus 
decide whether Republicans will be allowed to offer alternatives and to 
offer amendments to the proposal before us, and that is extension of 
the Unemployment Insurance Act.
  I was one of six who voted for the motion to proceed for the very 
purpose of achieving the opportunity to offer ideas which I have had 
and to allow others on our side of the aisle to offer their ideas as to 
how we can improve this program, and how we ought to address it at this 
point in our continuing effort to struggle out of the great recession 
now into its fifth year.
  Unemployment is still high in my State--over 7 percent--as a number 
of States, which is unacceptable, and particularly into the fifth year 
after a recession. The growth has been so anemic and so tepid, we are 
sort of staggering our way into a better position.
  Nevertheless, while some people are finding jobs and getting back to 
work, there are many who aren't. That is a serious subject and 
something we ought to be debating and talking about.
  Unemployment insurance is one of the programs which has been proposed 
to help those in need. There are people who are genuinely in need of 
that help and have made every possible effort to get back to work and, 
for many reasons, have not been able to do so. But we also know, and it 
has been documented, that there are many people who have taken 
advantage of this program and basically said, I don't have to work hard 
to get back to work because I am getting enough support from the 
government.
  We have to acknowledge the fact that there are policy issues which 
have to be discussed as we go forward without automatically extending a 
program where we know reforms would make the program better and would 
put us in a better position to help people get back to work and to move 
our economy.
  We also know, working now to just pass a budget for the first time 
here in several years to work off of, the number we agreed on we 
wouldn't go over is now being violated. The very first legislative 
piece which has come before this body violates the budget agreement 
which was agreed to a short time ago. So a number of us would like the 
opportunity to propose ways to offset the spending if this program goes 
forward.
  The combination of those two things--reforms which will allow us to 
continue to support those who are genuinely unable to find work from 
those who are taking advantage of the program and abuse of the program, 
as well as suggestions as to how we can support efforts toward more 
full employment through training programs, through any number of 
initiatives--my colleagues would like to at least talk about, at least 
debate, and at least have a vote on. We are in the minority here. We 
are not sure we are going to win any of those votes. Although I think 
if we make persuasive enough arguments and it makes enough sense, 
perhaps we will.
  Given this 2-day delay in terms of a decision from majority leader 
Harry Reid as to whether to allow us these opportunities, it appears 
that through this tactic of supporting the motion to proceed we have 
literally put the ball in Harry Reid's office and his caucus court as 
to what they want to do.
  We went through the year 2013, and since July, Republicans have been 
offered a total of only four amendments to all the things done in the 
last 6

[[Page S194]]

months of this year. That is not how the Senate is supposed to work. 
That is a dictatorial dictate by the majority leader, unprecedented in 
200 years or more of operation of this Senate.
  So we are waiting for that decision, and, obviously, that decision 
will have a bearing on my position on this particular issue.
  I would also comment on the fact that lately we have been hearing a 
lot from the President about income inequality, and I anticipate we 
will be hearing a lot more as we move toward the 2014 elections in 
November. There will be a debate on this, and I hope there will be a 
debate which allows both sides to look at this in a serious way and try 
to find ways to address the issue. But if we do that, I think it is 
important we understand that the President's signature accomplishment, 
the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare, as it is called--is contributing to 
the problem of income inequality. So any debate on that issue, to be 
factually accurate and to be truthful, needs to incorporate a 
conversation about the impact of ObamaCare.
  As recently as 2012, we were told by the President that the health 
insurance premiums paid by small businesses and individuals ``will go 
down.'' Yet even as the administration recently has admitted that many 
Americans will pay more for health care because of ObamaCare, this week 
the latest report on health spending trends from CMS--the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid--disclosed that health care spending in the 
United States rose 3.7 percent in 2012. That is less than it rose in 
previous years, and that is a good sign.
  Many are saying, well, the reason for this is the Affordable Care 
Act. Had we not passed the Affordable Care Act, this wouldn't have 
happened. Apparently, though, they did not read the rest of the report 
because the report also states that the provisions in the Affordable 
Care Act had minimal impact on total national health care spending. So 
while the administration may claim that their bill, ObamaCare, is 
lowering overall health care spending, the report says it has only had 
a minimal impact.

  What is happening is that there are reforms being made through the 
private sector, through the providers, in terms of more efficient, more 
effective ways to deliver health care. That is not operating because of 
the health care act. In fact, the health care act, if we are truthful 
about it, is contributing to the problem of inequality.
  Many Americans are experiencing, despite what the President has said, 
higher premiums or paying outrageous deductibles when they purchase 
coverage through the ObamaCare exchanges. Let's bring this down to a 
personal level because I have been receiving hundreds, actually 
thousands of emails, phone calls, letters, comments that I hear back 
home from Hoosiers who basically say: This ain't working. It is sure 
not working for me.
  But I want to bring it down to the personal level so we can 
understand what individual families are going through at this 
particular time with this mandate imposed upon them relative to their 
health care coverage.
  Thomas from Indianapolis wrote to me and said he went on the 
ObamaCare exchange to take a look at health insurance plans that would 
be available to him and he was, as he said, ``shocked to find that it 
was at least $200 a month.'' That is $2,400 a year more than he had 
been quoted just a few months before from a broker. He added, ``I have 
thought about just going without insurance''--as we know many 
individuals are thinking about and have decided not to sign up for this 
program. Of course, the program is built financially on the fact that 
millions will sign up and that is not happening. I predict that is 
going to break the back of the program. He added:

       I have thought about going without insurance, but my family 
     suggested that I not do that. The Affordable Care Act has 
     created a terrible quandary for me. At this point I feel as 
     if the Federal Government is like a mean Big Brother, making 
     my life miserable.

  William from Granger, IN, emailed me to tell me his wife, who works 
as a part-time nurse, now is no longer offered health care because she 
is part time. So William then decided, OK, I will have to go into the 
exchange and find insurance for my wife and my family and discovered 
that their premiums will rise to $19,076 a year. He goes on to say, 
``So much for `if you like your plan, if you like your doctor . . . 
your costs will go down by $2,500.' ''
  Let me repeat that. The President has said your costs are going to go 
down by an average of $2,500 a year. William's costs increased over 
$7,500 a year. That is a $10,500 swing. That is not what was promised.
  Brandy from Cambridge City, IN, told me:

       I have been offered insurance through work at a cost of 
     $318 or $80 a week. I then checked HealthCare.Gov and have 
     been given a quote of $450 a month. I work a minimum wage job 
     and work as many hours as I can to get by as it is. After 
     taxes and child support, neither option is an option that I 
     can afford.

  He also cannot even afford to pay the penalty of the payment.
  These are just a few of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Hoosier 
comments I have heard from people who are experiencing sticker shock 
when they search for so-called affordable care under ObamaCare. I don't 
know if these people are Republicans or Democrats, conservatives, 
moderates, liberals, nonvoters or voters. These are just human beings 
who live in my State, regardless of their political affiliation, who 
are basically saying this thing is killing us. All these examples, 
multiplied by hundreds if not thousands, are contributing to the 
inequality the President is talking about.
  The inescapable truth is that the Democrats forced an unwanted, 
unpopular, and unread--the famous quote from then House Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi--``We have to pass the bill so we can find out what is in it''--
and we are finding out about what is in it--an unwanted, unpopular, and 
unread 2000-plus page, one-size-fits-all health care bill, dictated by 
one party without any support from the minority.
  I am questioning whether this is the best way to deal with health 
care issues. Jamming this thing through on Christmas Eve day in 2009 
has turned out to be a disastrous Christmas gift for the American 
people. Families across our country who are being forced to redirect 
money they would have used to pay rent, to help their children attend 
school, to put food on the table, to pay the electric bills, are 
finding many cannot even do that.
  As we discuss the issue of income inequality, and it appears the 
President is going to want to do that throughout this coming election 
year, let's not pretend that ObamaCare is helping the situation. It is 
not. We need to face up to the fact that the Affordable Care Act--I bet 
the writers of this bill, if they could do it over again, wish they had 
not used the word ``affordable.'' They could call it the health care 
act or health care act for American people or whatever. If they went 
back and rewrote it, I bet you they would drop the word ``affordable,'' 
based on the facts, not the perception, the fact of what this health 
care bill is.
  I suspect they would have wanted to pass this in a bipartisan way so 
that at this point in time they would not have to take full 
responsibility for this act. Too many hard-working American families 
are paying more, not less, for health care because of ObamaCare, and it 
is contributing to the inequality the President continues to talk 
about.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

    HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO 
                           PROCEED--Continued

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.


                       Functioning of the Senate

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to continue the discussion 
about the description of the Senate as a deliberative body and continue 
to echo the call for the distinguished minority leader for a return to 
a functional Senate. I have spoken on this issue before. I think it is 
best to go back to the Constitution and the people who wrote the 
Constitution for an understanding of what was intended when the Senate 
was set up. So I do not intend to dwell on the use of the so-called 
nuclear option related to the filibuster.
  The reason I am not going to spend my time on the nuclear option 
today as in previous speeches is the majority leader claims the 
Senate's dysfunction is related to some unprecedented use of 
filibusters. I think that has been thoroughly debunked. This claim is 
directly refuted by the very source he has pointed to, the 
Congressional Research Service.
  More importantly, it has been debunked by fact checkers in important 
media sources in America. Yet, as we know, the Senate is dysfunctional 
beyond a doubt. To get to the bottom of how and, more importantly, why 
the Senate is not functioning, we must have a clear understanding of 
just how the Senate is supposed to function. As I just said, we should 
turn to the Constitution.
  For an understanding of what the Constitution means, there is no 
better source for this than going back to the Federalist Papers. I have 
referenced the Federalist Papers before on this subject, but it is 
worth the detail about what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind 
when the Senate was created.
  Federalist Paper 62, which is usually attributed to the Father of the 
Constitution, James Madison, begins to lay out the rationale for how 
the Senate is to operate. He mentioned that the number of Members and 
the length of terms are different between the House and Senate. Then he 
said this--but before I quote, I hope you understand that when 
something was written in 1787 and 1788, they use a little different 
form of English than what we use. But it is pretty clear what they 
intended to say about explaining the difference between the House and 
the Senate. So here begins my quote of James Madison:

       In order to form an accurate judgment on both of these 
     points, it will be proper to inquire into the purposes which 
     are to be answered by a Senate; and in order to ascertain 
     these, it will be necessary to review the inconveniences 
     which a Republic must suffer from the want of such an 
     institution.

  End of that quote, but I will have several other quotes from the 
Federalist Papers. In this specific quote, in

[[Page S426]]

other words, Madison is going to tell us the purpose of the Senate, 
starting with the problems a Republic would face without a Senate and 
how the Senate is designed to correct those problems. As we hear from 
Madison about how our legislative process is supposed to work, I would 
encourage my colleagues to think about major legislation that has been 
considered in the Senate in recent years.
  In fact, arguably the most major bill that has passed in recent 
years, President Obama's health care law, serves as one example. When 
that law was considered, one party held all political branches of 
government: the Presidency, the House of Representatives, and even had 
a supermajority in the Senate. That means they could run the Senate 
like the House, without the need to compromise with any in the 
minority.
  At that particular time, my party was then and still is in the 
minority. We are now dealing with daily problems caused by the way the 
health care law was written, which is something to keep in mind as 
Madison describes in these coming quotes. The problems the Senate was 
designed to prevent, here is the first problem Madison discusses. It is 
a fairly long quote from the Federalist. First he says:

       First. It is a misfortune incident to republican 
     government, though in less degree than to other governments, 
     that those who administer it may forget their obligations to 
     their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important 
     trust. In this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of 
     the legislative assembly, distinct from, and dividing the 
     power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on 
     the government. It doubles the security to the people, by 
     requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes 
     of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of 
     one would otherwise be sufficient. This is a precaution 
     founded on such clear principles, and now so well understood 
     in the United States, that it would be more than superfluous 
     to enlarge on it.

  Then Madison goes on:

       I will barely remark, that as the improbability of sinister 
     combinations will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in 
     the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to 
     distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which 
     will consist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and 
     with the genuine principles of republican government.

  I see it this way: In other words, Madison is saying having a second 
Chamber of Congress designed to operate differently from the House 
makes it less likely that a partisan agenda that does not reflect the 
views of Americans will pass. That is not a function the Senate 
currently performs, as it has been run on a purely partisan term since 
2007.
  For example, we will recall that the President's health care proposal 
did not enjoy widespread public support. Yet it passed the Senate along 
strictly partisan lines with little input sought or accepted from the 
minority party. In fact, before a final bill could be passed 
reconciling the House and Senate bills, a special election was held in 
the liberal State of Massachusetts, resulting in an election of an 
opponent of the health care reform proposal.
  Instead of moderating the proposal based upon public will and doing 
it maybe just a little bit so it could attract even one Republican 
vote, the House passed a draft Senate bill, then they used a budget 
tool called reconciliation to ram another bill through the Senate with 
a simply majority to change items in the first bill.
  That is not how Madison intended a bicameral Congress to work. The 
next point Madison makes:

       Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated 
     by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to 
     yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to 
     be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and 
     pernicious resolutions. Examples on this subject might be 
     cited without number; and from proceedings within the United 
     States, as well as from the history of other nations. But a 
     position that will not be contradicted, need not be proved. 
     All that need be remarked is, that a body which is to correct 
     this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and 
     consequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, 
     to possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its 
     authority by a tenure of considerable duration.

  That describes what he thought the Senate should be, what the Senate 
is. But my point is, the Senate is not functioning that way. In other 
words, if we have just one legislative Chamber with a large number of 
Members, it is likely to make laws hastily based on a partisan agenda 
without thinking through all the long-term consequences. A hastily 
passed partisan agenda that ignores the long-term consequences, does 
that not remind you of the health care law? Remember how then-Speaker 
Pelosi said the House had to pass a bill to find out what was in it?
  They were in such a rush they could not be bothered to read it.
  The Senate is intended, as Madison just said, as I quoted, to be 
smaller, to be more deliberate, and to be less partisan. Imagine if the 
Senate had been allowed to operate in a deliberative fashion and craft 
a truly bipartisan health care proposal. If that had happened, we 
certainly could have come up with something more workable than the 
current law.
  Madison continues his explanation of the rationale for the Senate:

       Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in 
     a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of 
     legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men 
     called for the most part from pursuits of a private nature, 
     continued in appointment for a short time, and led by no 
     permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation 
     to a study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive 
     interests of their country, should, if left wholly to 
     themselves, escape a variety of important errors in the 
     exercise of their legislative trust. It may be affirmed, on 
     the best grounds, that no small share of the present 
     embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of 
     our governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads 
     rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What 
     indeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, 
     which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many 
     monuments of deficient wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited 
     by each succeeding against each preceding session; so many 
     admonitions to the people, of the value of those aids which 
     may be expected from a well-constituted Senate?
       A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to 
     the object of government, which is the happiness of the 
     people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that 
     object can best be attained. Some governments are deficient 
     in both these qualities; most governments are deficit in the 
     first. I scruple not to assert, that in American governments 
     too little attention has been paid to the last. The federal 
     Constitution avoids this error; and what merits particular 
     notice, it provides for the last in a mode which increases 
     the security for the first.

  That is a long quote. But Madison is essentially saying that the 
House is to be composed of a representative slice of American citizens 
while the Senate is supposed to be composed of individuals who have 
more experience and approach public policy more thoughtfully. I am sure 
many people might question whether individuals in the House or even in 
this Senate match those descriptions today that Madison lays out.
  But it is true that the rules of the House allow for new ideas to be 
quickly translated into legislation.
  By contrast, the process in the Senate has historically been slower 
and more deliberative to refine those ideas into law that can stand the 
test of time. Note that Madison complains about all the ``repealing, 
explaining, and amending laws'' that have had to be passed by the 
unicameral legislatures of that time--of the early days of our 
Republic.
  Our early experiences with passing bills quickly, without thinking 
things through, led to the understanding that we should take our time 
and get it right in the first place.
  Getting back to Madison and those quotes I gave, that is what the 
Senate is supposed to do. Failure of the Senate to take the time, 
examine, and take time to revise legislation is quite obvious. It 
results in bad laws that don't work.
  We now have a situation with the health care law where the President 
claims the authority to unilaterally suspend or reinterpret parts of 
the law that are clearly unworkable.
  That is very similar to the embarrassing situation Madison refers to, 
to have a constant stream of ``repealing, explaining, and amending 
laws,'' except the President is doing all of the repealing, all of the 
explaining, and all of the amending, unilaterally.
  Our constitutional system is not designed to pass a lot of 
legislation quickly, and that can be frustrating, particularly to any 
majority party anxious to enact its agenda.
  Still, our deliberative process is a design and not a flaw. Based on 
experience, the Framers of our Constitution

[[Page S427]]

determined that it was better to get it right the first time than to 
subject the American people to the upheavals of laws that need to be 
constantly amended or repealed. The House was designed to act quickly. 
The Senate was designed to be a deliberative body, implying a slower 
approach to legislating.
  The fundamental problem is that the current majority leader is trying 
to run the Senate like the House, and the Senate was not designed to be 
operated in that way. Sure--with the majority then and now the 
majority, the same majority when they had 60 votes--it was possible to 
ram legislation through the Senate without any deliberation, but that 
is no longer the reality.
  When the majority leader brings a bill to the floor, routinely 
blocking amendments and then rapidly moves to end consideration of the 
bill, that means the Senate is presented with a measure as a fait 
accompli and has to take it or, the opposite, leave it.
  In other words, the majority leadership wants their agenda approved, 
no questions asked, or nothing at all.
  The fact is, if the majority leader allowed the Senate to deliberate, 
we could get a lot more done than we have been doing. Sure, we might 
not get as many laws passed as some people might like. The full Senate, 
through its deliberation, may alter legislation somewhat from how the 
majority leadership would prefer. Still, we would be able to accomplish 
some important legislation. But, no, that is not acceptable, we are 
told. One week ago today there was a strong debate on that very issue. 
For all the talk about getting things done, the majority leadership has 
demonstrated repeatedly with cloture motion after cloture motion that 
it would rather grind this body to a halt than allow the slightest 
alteration of their agenda.
  The latest message from the majority leadership is that they will 
respect the rights of Senators to offer an amendment only if they have 
certain assurances about the final outcome. The senior Senator from New 
York implied that is the way it used to be done.
  Well, I want to assure that Senator that in the 33 years I have 
served in the Senate, it has never been done that way. I have managed a 
lot of bills over the years, and if I had tried to impose that 
requirement, I would have been laughed at, to say the least.
  Since when did duly elected Senators have to negotiate for the right 
to represent their constituents? An open amendment process should be 
the default situation, not something that is granted at the sufferance 
of the majority party leadership.
  We must get back then to what we call in the Senate regular order. I 
would say do things the way Madison intended. That means an open 
amendment process without preconditions or special limitations on what 
amendments will be allowed.
  Cloture shouldn't even be contemplated until after a substantial 
number of amendments have been processed. That was the standard 
practice when the Senate got things done, when we accomplished things.
  Again, Madison describes a Senate that is to represent all Americans, 
not only one party. It was designed to be more thoughtful and 
deliberative and, whether we like it or not, slower than the House of 
Representatives.
  The Senate's purpose is to make sure that Congress passes fewer but 
better laws. We saw what happened when the Senate was controlled 
entirely by one party while the voices of the minority party and the 
citizens they represented were ignored. We got a deeply flawed health 
care law and the American people are paying the price. Yet the majority 
leader insists on running the Senate as if he still has 60 votes, 
doesn't have to compromise, and even refuses to compromise. That is not 
how the authors of our Constitution intended the Senate to work and, of 
course, it isn't working.
  The Senate is facing a crisis, and the only way to solve it is to 
restore the Senate as a deliberative body envisioned by the authors of 
the Constitution and express it in an explanatory way in the Federalist 
Papers.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.


                           Senate Functioning

  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the fact that Senator Grassley has given us 
his view of how the Senate ought to work. When the Senator says more 
deliberative and knowing how many filibusters have been supported on 
that side, that is what it says to me. As someone who didn't want to 
change the filibuster rules because I thought maybe we would come to 
some agreement, and we wouldn't be facing historic numbers of 
filibusters, let me say what the majority leader did was the right 
thing. It was the right thing.
  I have been in Washington a long time. I came to the House in 1983. 
The Senate worked well. It isn't working well.
  What the majority leader said is how can we have a President, be he 
or she Republican or Democratic, how can we have that President 
function without a team in place, a team, their team. One person can't 
run a country; they need a team. One Senator can't run our offices; we 
need a team.
  My God, what if we were told that we couldn't put our team together 
unless we had a vote that wasn't a majority vote, it had to be a 
supermajority? We would never get anything done. We would be running in 
circles. It would be very difficult.
  It sounds to me as if my friend wants to go back to the bad old days 
where we would have all of these nominees objected to, stalled. It took 
154 days to get the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency.
  My view, having been here, loved this institution, loved my work, and 
enjoyed my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the Senate has 
changed because the parties have moved so far apart. Let's call it what 
it is. In my eyes Republicans have moved so far to the right that, 
unlike years ago when I came, it is very difficult to get anything done 
legislatively.
  That is why today is one of those bright, rare moments. My hat is off 
to Senator Mikulski, Senator Shelby, and their House counterparts. We 
actually got something done. Half of the Republicans joined all of the 
Democrats to pass an Omnibus appropriations bill. This is a good thing 
for America. No side got everything it wanted, we know that. Do you 
know what the American people received? They got compromise, they got 
security, and they got stability. In the near future we are not going 
to have shutdowns, shouting matches, and debates through the night on 
whether we should have a government.
  We need more legislating such as this. That is why I so look forward 
to getting the Water Resources Development Act done. This is so 
important to so many of our States. We need to do flood control. We 
need to do adaptation. We need to make sure there is recreation on our 
wetlands and so on. We need dredging in our ports. Those are the 
economic engines of our Nation.
  We have a bill we passed. Over in the House they have a bill. We are 
now in the middle of trying to conference the differences, and I am 
very hopeful we are going to get it done. Senator Vitter and I are 
working together to get it done. It is a little slower than we would 
like in terms of progress, but I am convinced we are going to have a 
bill before this body. We need to take care of the people's business.
  Guess what. The President of the United States has a right to get his 
team in place. It is as simple as it is.
  The people know it. I go home and the people say: Hooray, thank God 
you people are doing something. You are getting people confirmed.
  Then we have the courts. We have courts where the judgeships are 
vacant. Justice delayed is justice denied. We need those judges in 
their places. The Senator from Iowa, I remember, made a big, eloquent 
speech about how we wanted to ``pack'' the courts. Anyone who knows 
anything about history knows pack the courts means wanting to add more 
judges and put your people in it. It doesn't mean filling vacancies. I 
think he got off that. But that was something to listen to.
  We need to take care of the people's business and not play politics 
depending on who is in the White House. Unemployment insurance was a 
perfect example of this.
  Under George W. Bush, between putting in place the unemployment 
insurance and extending it, we did it five times, no offsets. Now all 
of a sudden the Republicans--people are struggling. I am stunned that 
we couldn't come together and extend unemployment insurance for the 1.5 
million people right

[[Page S428]]

now and the 250,000 Californians included in that 1.5 million who have 
run out of hope.
  The Republicans said: Pay for it, even though the deficit has been 
cut in half. They have suddenly noticed the deficit. After George Bush 
it was $1.4 trillion. They put two wars on the credit card, and they 
put a huge tax cut for millionaires on the credit card. Oh, no problem. 
Now they have discovered the deficit even though it has been cut in 
half by this President. Oh, we have to pay for it.
  OK, we said, we have to pay for it, we will pay for it. We gave them 
an offset that we took out of Paul Ryan's budget. It wasn't good enough 
for them. Then they said: We want amendments. We have to have 
amendments, just give us some amendments. I will give you some 
unemployment insurance for these struggling people.
  Then Harry Reid: Twenty amendments, OK; 5 a side and 5 side-by-sides, 
20 amendments.
  Oh, no, that wasn't good enough.
  It is childish. People are struggling. They are deciding whether they 
can put heat on in their house. They are wondering whether they can pay 
the rent, whether they are going to lose their homes, whether they are 
going to have to beg other family members for their help. This is 
outrageous. Outrageous.
  Income inequality is outrageous.
  Does the Presiding Officer know that 400 families are worth more in 
wealth than 150 million Americans? Let me say that again: Four hundred 
families in America are worth more than half the United States of 
America. And when there were tax cuts for those people, I never heard 
one word from one Republican about a pay-for. The deficit soared. They 
all voted to go to war. No problem. But we want to help these families 
who are desperate--middle-class families, people who have paid into the 
workers unemployment insurance fund, people who are looking for work 
because they can't get that extended unemployment unless they can prove 
that--and no. Nobody is home over there.

  I appreciate that some of my colleagues made a speech about poverty. 
Great. How about doing something about it? How about doing something 
about it, and not just speechifying? Where are they in raising the 
minimum wage? I don't know, maybe they will come with us. I don't see 
it. I really don't see it. I hope so. I pray so. I do. So far, I don't 
see it.
  In the last Presidential election of 2012, the Republican leader said 
his top priority was defeating President Obama. That is what the 
Republican leader said--not working for the people of this country, not 
passing legislation to make their life better, not moving forward and 
making sure the air we breathe is clean, the water we drink is safe, 
not making sure our kids have a good education and workers get job 
training--no. Top priority: Defeating President Obama. President Obama 
won; so why don't you wake up and smell the roses and understand we 
need to work together. You have to accept reality.
  Look. I have had my candidates in the past win and lose. I have been 
here through tough elections. We lost the Senate, then we won the 
Senate. We lost the House, then we won the House. We won the 
Presidency, then we lost it. Guess what. I had to understand that when 
it comes to legislating, we put that aside. We fight hard during an 
election, but once it is over you don't carry that over. You work 
together.
  But too many on the other side are politically motivated. All they 
want to do is hurt our President, day in and day out criticizing him 
endlessly, not working with him. He has offered that olive branch over 
and over, whether it is on economic recovery, jobs, health care, the 
environment, income inequality--even foreign policy--day after day.
  Here is the thing you never hear from the other side, so I am going 
to talk about it tonight. When President Obama took office, the economy 
was losing over 700,000 jobs a month. Now we have added 8 million 
private-sector jobs in the past 45 months. How does that compare to 
George W. Bush? After 8 years in office, President Bush's record was 
that we lost 665,000 private-sector jobs. So far we have added 8 
million private-sector jobs in the past 45 months.
  When President Obama took office--we remember those days, frightening 
days with the stock market collapsing. Now the stock market has gone up 
10,000 points. That is unbelievable. The GDP--gross domestic product--
was contracting at a rate of 8.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 
as we said goodbye to George W. Bush. Now we just learned that the GDP 
grew by 4.1 percent in the third quarter. Is this President satisfied? 
Are we? No. But have we turned it around? Yes. Does the President ever 
get one ounce of credit for any of this? No. No.
  How about looking at our deficit. Let's look at that, something the 
Republicans claim is a very central part of it. This is it--a $1.4 
trillion deficit down now to 680, going down to 560, and falling at the 
fastest rate in many, many years, just as health care costs are not 
rising the way they used to. Do you think we would hear one word about 
it from the other side? No. No.
  Even on foreign policy, even on foreign policy, politics used to stop 
at the water's edge. Senator Grassley has a historic perspective. I do 
too. Politics used to stop at the water's edge when it came to foreign 
policy. No more. No more.
  But you would never know the deficit has been cut in half, and you 
would never know that 8 million private-sector jobs have been created 
if you listen to my friends on the other side because they can't give 
any credit to President Obama. But history will. History will.
  The last thing I am going to talk about is health care. I listened to 
my colleague Senator Cruz go after this President and the Democrats on 
health care. So let us look at a few things.
  First fact: Even though we had a horrible roll-out of the health care 
site--not in California but the Federal site, healthcare.gov--and a 
couple of States had a horrible roll-out, let's put that aside. This is 
what we know.
  There are more now, but I didn't have a chance to make a new chart. 
We are getting to 10 million Americans, but over 9 million Americans 
have new, secure health insurance; 3 million young adults have stayed 
on their parents insurance policies; 3.9 million are on Medicaid; and 
there are 2.1 million exchange plans, the private plans.
  Let me show this another way on the private plans--the 2.1 million. 
Now we think it is more. It is a little bit more. Here we are. Very, 
very tough roll-out. Nothing worked. Now it is working, and it is 
spiking, and it is only going to get better.
  But you wouldn't know that because Senator Cruz keeps saying over and 
over: What have the Democrats in the Senate done to protect the people 
from ObamaCare? I have to protect the people from him because if he had 
his way, he would repeal ObamaCare. I ask you: What is going to happen 
to those young people if Senator Cruz has his way and we repeal 
ObamaCare? What happens to the 3 million young adults? They are back on 
their own. They have no insurance. They are back at the emergency room. 
What happens to those on expanded Medicaid? Forget it. What happens to 
the exchanges? They would be gone.
  So while Senator Cruz says we have done nothing to protect the 
people, the opposite is true. We stand in support of the people--the 
people's right to get affordable health care. Do we have the perfect 
answer on every front? No. Do we have to make corrections? Of course.
  We had a meeting with the President yesterday. He is reaching out his 
hand to the Republicans and Democrats. If we can fix this in any way 
and make it work better, we will.
  Let's look at some of our other charts as far as what our Republican 
colleagues want to do when they say repeal ObamaCare. I am telling you, 
400,000 Californians have enrolled, and now it is 500,000. It is 
500,000 Californians who have enrolled in an exchange plan through--
coveredCA.com. This is working in my State. It is working.
  I am not going to allow Senator Cruz to take the benefits away from 
my people who are writing me letters--and I have some of them here, and 
I will read a little bit of those stories.
  John Nunnemacher is a 43-year-old freelance graphic artist from San 
Jose, and the last time he had health insurance was 15 years ago, when 
his employer paid for coverage. But as of January 1, John is covered by 
a plan he can finally afford. This is what he told the San Jose Mercury 
News:

       I hoped this day would come. I worried that it wouldn't. 
     And I'm very glad that it finally has.


[[Page S429]]


  So he is happy, and I am not going to let Senator Cruz take away his 
insurance. Let's be clear. Let's be clear. He waited for a long time, 
and I am not going back. We can't go back to those days when there was 
no insurance for our young people. We can't go back to the days when 
being a woman was a preexisting condition, and you got charged double 
that of a man. We can't go back to the days where kids were thrown off 
their parents' policies. We just can't go back.
  Amy Torregrossa, 27, is from San Francisco. She had been without 
insurance since July, when coverage through her partner's company ended 
because he changed jobs. She has a congenital heart defect and a 
history of high blood pressure. She no longer runs because she says 
``if I twist my ankle or get hit by a car . . . any doctor visit is so 
expensive.''
  She signed up on Covered California for a silver plan costing $310 a 
month. She made sure her cardiologist was in the insurer's network and 
plans to schedule a checkup for early this year.
  Amy, I am not going to let anyone take this away from you. I am not.
  Michelle Strong, 57, is a self-employed product designer. For many 
years she could not afford any insurance at all because of a false-
positive--a false positive--test for lupus, which incorrectly flagged 
her as having a preexisting condition. For the past 15 years she could 
only afford catastrophic insurance. Now, thanks to a tax credit, she 
will pay $55 a month, with no deductible, and a $3 copay. Here is what 
she said:

       It just blows my mind that I can get health insurance at 
     this price. I can finally afford checkups, tests, and age-
     related visits.

  Michelle, I am not going to let anyone take your insurance away from 
you. You deserve it.
  Elaine Post, 64, from West Hills, CA. She told CNN:

       When I first got laid off, I tried to get private insurance 
     through the big companies. They all rejected me . . . wanted 
     to charge me really, really high premiums for not very good 
     insurance.

  Now Elaine has coverage through a bronze plan through Covered 
California that costs $461 a month.
  Elaine, you are going to keep your insurance and we are going to 
protect you.

    HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2013--MOTION TO 
                           PROCEED--Continued


                      American Opportunity Agenda

  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, when I was growing up, my now 93-year-old 
granddaddy would hold the newspaper and read it while he drank his 
coffee. Every morning it seemed he was always focused on reading the 
paper. He looked like an executive, a doctor or an attorney, always 
making sure his grandsons saw him reading.
  I learned several years later that my granddaddy couldn't read, but 
he was wise enough to model the behavior that he wanted his grandsons 
to follow. The circumstances of his life forced him out of the 
classroom at a very young age and into the cotton fields to help 
support his family. But granddaddy has now lived long enough to see a 
grandson elected to Congress and another grandson earn the rank of 
command sergeant major in the U.S. Army. Only 1 percent of NCOs reach 
that rank.
  In a single lifetime, families can go from not having a fair chance 
to learn to read to seeing their kids graduate from college, as my 
grandfather has seen two of his grandsons graduate. That is the power 
of America. That is the power of opportunity.
  Over the last several months, I have spent many hours talking and 
working with people from every walk of life, beginning when I was 
bagging groceries at the local Piggly Wiggly or waiting tables at the 
California Dreaming or 2 weeks ago when I took a ride on the public bus 
just to have an opportunity to sit back and talk with everyday 
Americans about their hopes, their dreams, and their fears or, last 
weekend, as I swept floors at the local Moe's restaurant. What I have 
heard is that people in America and throughout South Carolina are 
hungry for opportunity. They are working hard, but still they are 
struggling.
  People want to work. They want to get ahead, and they still want a 
better life for their children and their grandchildren. So the 
questions for those of us in government are simple: Are we a part of 
the problem or are we a part of the solution? Do we make things more 
difficult or are we an ally in this struggle to get ahead? Are we 
trying the same tactics and getting the same results?
  It has been said several times that insanity is doing the same things 
the same ways and hoping for different results. After a nearly 50-year 
government-led war on poverty, the poverty rates are increasing. Were 
this a military conflict, we would have changed our strategy decades 
ago, but somehow we fail to learn and continue to believe that next 
year it will be different. It has not been different in nearly half a 
century.
  I propose a new way forward--a new way forward so a little girl can 
rise from the depths of poverty and become the CEO of a Fortune 500 
company, a new way forward that will create a place where young men 
raised in a single-parent household and living in the inner city 
housing projects can become a world-renowned surgeon, a new way forward 
so an intelligent young lady living in rural South Carolina who ages 
out of the foster care program can still afford a college education. I 
propose a new way forward, and our opportunity agenda does just that.
  We will help to turn neglected neighborhoods ravished by poverty into 
centers of excellence. We will see that these amazing centers of 
excellence will become economic engines because of the creativity of 
the people living in the neighborhoods. We will see economic activity 
in a place that we once thought not possible.
  Today, too many Americans are trapped in low-paying jobs because they 
lack the skills to improve their incomes. These folks are not asking 
for a handout; they are asking for a hand up. Every day Americans are 
struggling, working hard, looking for a way to change their destiny.
  That is why we have introduced the SKILLS Act. With nearly 4 million 
jobs vacant in America today, we believe the skills gap can be covered 
because of the SKILLS Act.
  Our second bill we have filed is called the CHOICE Act, Creating Hope 
and Opportunity for Individuals and Communities through Education. One 
of the opportunities we see within the CHOICE Act is for those kids who 
have special needs to have the opportunity to make their education 
dollars portable. I believe every single American deserves the 
opportunity to realize their full potential, but too many of these 
young kids--bright kids with special needs--do not receive the 
education that is best for them. So the CHOICE Act provides their 
parents with portability so they can choose the school that best fits 
the needs of their kids.
  The American Opportunity Agenda encourages each of us to reach our 
full potential. In the coming months we will introduce legislation that 
encourages reform of our welfare programs. We will fight to change our 
Tax Code so small businesses can hire more people and not simply pay 
higher taxes. Finally, we will work with anyone, anywhere, at any time 
to reduce the regulatory burdens that stand in the way and close the 
doors of opportunity.
  Last week we submitted an amendment that restores a 40-hour workweek 
that was destroyed in ObamaCare. The effort to restore the 40-hour 
workweek has been led by my colleague, the Senator from Maine Susan 
Collins, who understands the devastation caused by ObamaCare, where 
more than 20 million Americans face the loss of up to 25 percent of 
their income when they move from 40 hours a week to less than 30 hours 
a week. I applaud my colleague and others for standing strong

[[Page S345]]

and standing tall to make sure we have a serious debate about the 
income inequality that is caused by ObamaCare. The effort to restore 
the 40-hour workweek should be something we all champion, realizing its 
massive impact on our economy.
  I have lived a family's journey from cotton to Congress. I know the 
sense of empowerment and optimism it provides. Once the standard is set 
in a family, as my grandfather set it in our family, and once the 
standard is set in a community or a State, the generations to come will 
set even higher expectations for themselves because success is created 
almost anywhere in America today. It happens in studio apartments, at 
kitchen tables; it happens in garages and classrooms throughout 
America, but it doesn't often happen in government conference rooms in 
Washington. I believe, and I have experienced, that with a good 
education, strong work skills, and the help of our Heavenly Father, all 
things are truly possible.
  I yield the floor.
  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. COONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                             Appropriations

  Mr. COONS. Madam President, today, this week, we have come together 
to consider an omnibus appropriations bill. That is a big mouthful--an 
omnibus appropriations bill--but I hope to lay out in plain language 
for our folks back home and for those in this Chamber why that matters, 
why I am excited about it, and why I support it.
  This is first time since I joined this body 3 years ago that we have 
considered one, and it is a real step forward. The agreement we came to 
on the budget and the agreement I hope we will pass on this 
appropriations bill means no more shutdowns, no more crises, no more 
autopilot, at least not for this fiscal year. This bill helps us return 
to regular order and to the process that, once election day is over, it 
is our job as the representatives of the people, elected to come 
together to find common ground, to solve bigger problems together, and 
to move the Nation forward.
  This appropriations bill is the result of a lot of hard work by 
Members and staff. I must begin first and foremost by thanking the 
Senate Appropriations Committee chair, Senator Mikulski, and the vice 
chair, Senator Shelby, as well as the House chairman Rogers, and the 
ranking member, Congresswoman Lowey, who showed great leadership and 
worked together on a very tight deadline to craft such a vast and 
comprehensive bill. Their work follows on the leadership of Senator 
Murray, chair of the Senate Budget Committee, and Congressman Ryan, of 
the House Budget Committee, after they came together on a bipartisan 
budget that paved the way for the Appropriations Committee to reach 
this deal this week.
  I applaud their leadership and thank them for the example they have 
set. As a member of both the Budget Committee and the Appropriations 
Committee, it has been a privilege to work with them to craft these 
bills and ensure we meet our Nation's needs.
  The bill before us is, of course, a compromise. It is the essence of 
a compromise that it is not perfect by any means. There are many who 
can find fault within it or disappointments aplenty among choices made 
or not made. It doesn't include--for example, to pick one thing of 
great importance to my State--enough funding to make real headway on 
Amtrak's critical infrastructure improvements that I think are 
essential--just in dealing with the $6 billion backlog of investments 
needed in aging tunnels, bridges, and tracks.
  So while this bill does provide adequate funding for Amtrak today, 
which I am very pleased about, it puts off those critically needed 
investments in repairing these essential elements of its 
infrastructure, which we will inevitably need to make. That is only one 
example, and in a bill this big there are hundreds, maybe even 
thousands, of the tough tradeoffs that had to be made between House and 
Senate, between the appropriators, and between the majority and the 
minority.
  But as we consider our vote on this bill and how it does or doesn't 
meet our own priorities or our State's priorities, we can't let the 
perfect be the enemy of the good. We need to remember that at least in 
this case the alternative to this bill isn't our own individual or 
perfect vision of government--whatever view we might hold. The 
alternative is crisis after crisis, government that doesn't move 
forward with the country but treads water as the world passes us by in 
an increasingly competitive global environment.
  What this bill does in a very real way is bring back some stability 
to our government, to our economy, and it allows us to make important 
investments in our country's growth. For instance, it takes a number of 
valuable steps for my home State of Delaware.
  It funds meat and poultry inspectors, critical to Delaware's chicken 
industry and its 13,000 jobs. It funds the next stage of an Army Corps 
of Engineers project to deepen the Delaware River from 40 to 45 feet so 
that we are ready and can be competitive when the expansion of the 
Panama Canal nears completion.
  It dedicates funding through the Victims of Child Abuse Act--and I am 
an original cosponsor of a bill reauthorizing the Victims of Child 
Abuse Act--for the three children's advocacy centers throughout my 
State. These centers are critical to delivering justice for the victims 
of child abuse without harming their healing process.
  The bill maintains funding for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, an 
initiative that has supplied Delaware police officers with nearly 1,000 
bulletproof vests in the past 2 years. Two of those vests, I should 
add, saved the lives of two officers during a shooting at the New 
Castle County Courthouse only last spring.
  These are only a few of the things for which I am grateful in this 
broad omnibus bill. Nationally, it also allows us to meet our key 
priorities of training our workforce for this century, making our 
communities safer, building a circle of protection around the most 
vulnerable in our society, and, in combination, making us safer, 
stronger, and more just.
  The investments it makes in America's workforce by funding education 
programs can last a lifetime. Head Start Programs ensure kids don't 
fall behind before they have even had a chance. This bill increases 
that funding by $1 billion to serve 90,000 more kids this year.
  There is a competitive grant program to help States and communities 
find innovative ways to provide high quality preschool options for low- 
and middle-income families that I am particularly excited about.
  In Delaware, we saw the power of this program when we competed for--
and won--Federal funding on a competitive basis for high-quality early 
education only last year.
  The Department of Education's first in the world initiative will help 
colleges to measure--and thus improve--outcomes, and it brings down 
costs for students and families. This bill increased our investment in 
job training programs such as Job Corps and the Veterans' Employment 
and Training Service, which help everyone from low-income Americans who 
failed to get on their feet in the job market to veterans who stood for 
us around the world and have earned our support upon their return.
  Next, this bill includes crucial funding that makes our communities 
safer. We are upping our investment in the COPS program--first 
championed on this floor by my predecessor Senator Joe Biden. It will 
put 1,500 more officers on our streets and in our neighborhoods, 
keeping us safe.
  The Violence Against Women Act, which we came together in a 
bipartisan manner to pass last year, is fully funded. We are taking 
important steps to stop the scourge of gun violence that affects each 
and every community: a new comprehensive school safety program I am 
excited about, new investments to improve background checks, and new 
training to help local law enforcement react and protect the public 
from active shooters.
  Of course, the second part of making our communities safer is 
ensuring that justice is delivered in our courts when

[[Page S346]]

crime does happen. Unfortunately, the sequester's cuts to our Federal 
courts cut the judiciary to the bone, imposing furloughs, and hurting 
our Nation's justice system by leading to layoffs of hundreds of 
experienced, seasoned, senior court staff. Yet, thankfully, the bill 
before us reverses these and many other cuts and will minimize the 
delays of justice that resulted and that are unacceptable to our 
Nation.

  Finally, this bill allows us to build and sustain what I like to call 
a circle of protection around the most vulnerable in our society that 
reflects our shared commitment to each other. Our most basic values: 
Investments in the WIC Program, for women, infants, and children, will 
make sure 87,000 more mothers and children will have the food they need 
at a vital early stage of development. LIHEAP--or the Low-Income 
Heating and Energy Assistance Program--ensures that low-income families 
don't freeze during the coldest months of the year, and this bill's 
funding increases will ensure 400,000 more houses have this critical 
assistance. And lastly, when we pass this bill, which I pray we will by 
week's end, we will reverse the sequester's devastating cuts to housing 
programs and, as a result, prevent more than 100,000 American families 
from becoming homeless.
  Each of these investments in our workforce, in our public safety, and 
in protection for our most vulnerable, together make up the foundation 
of a safer, a more just, and a more inclusive society. But when we also 
combine them with investments in research and innovation and 
infrastructure, we lay the groundwork for growth and shared prosperity 
today and tomorrow.
  After the last 3 years, which in my experience have been mostly 
defined by bipartisan gridlock--stopgap budgets, crisis governance--
this bipartisan Appropriations bill allows us to create some stability 
for our Nation and our economy. I think it reminds us we are a nation 
that is at its best when we are determined to be open to each other's 
ideas, to hear each other's concerns and criticisms, and to find ways 
to work together.
  Although there are plenty of areas where I disagree with my 
Republican colleagues, as I have gotten to know them over the past 3 
years we have found many more areas of common good and common work. Let 
me briefly mention a few of them as I celebrate what I think is the 
most important aspect of this bill, which is that it is truly 
bipartisan.
  Senator Marco Rubio and I were both elected in 2010 and came to this 
Chamber at roughly the same time, and we found ways to work together to 
invest in STEM education and to open pathways to college for young 
Americans. Senator Hatch and I wrote a bill together called I-Squared--
and we are joined by Senators Klobuchar and Rubio--and this is a bill 
that helps bring high-skilled workers to our shores and helps invest in 
STEM education for American citizens. Senator Kirk and I have worked 
together to create a national manufacturing strategy that focuses our 
energy and resources on creating manufacturing jobs in America. And 
just this Monday Senator Roberts of Kansas and I announced our 
partnership on a new bill to make the research and development tax 
credit and its funding available to startups and to young innovative 
companies.
  There are so many issues where we can work together to invest in our 
workforce, to protect the public, to sustain this storied circle of 
protection around the most vulnerable, to invest in long-term economic 
growth, and to lift up every community and every American.
  I am incredibly thankful for the leadership of Senators Mikulski and 
Shelby and the way they displayed that leadership with action through 
this process, by putting aside their differences and finding common 
ground. I wish to also close with a note of personal thanks to the 
countless committee staff on both sides who worked tirelessly 
throughout the holidays to make this bill a reality. With this Omnibus 
appropriations bill it is my sincere hope we are putting an end to a 
cycle of manufactured crises and we are sending to the American people 
and to our markets and to our communities the message that we can and 
will work together to confront the many challenges that remain here and 
in the future.
  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.
  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I came to the floor to spend some time 
on the unemployment insurance, but I have to comment, after hearing my 
colleague mention his esteemed favor of the bill that will be in front 
of us, I have to say my perspective is totally different.
  We have a 1,500-page bill that nobody has read, other than my staff, 
and we have read it completely and outlined it completely. We have a 
bill that is dishonest, because you still have changes in mandatory 
funding and programs and you create $17.9 billion out of nothing, which 
everybody on the Appropriations Committee knows allows you to spend 
$17.9 billion but not pay for, and you transfer that sleight of hand to 
our children.
  But it doesn't seem to bother anybody on the Appropriations Committee 
that we actually lie to the American public about how much we are 
actually going to spend. The bill actually spends about $63 billion, 
the way you have written it, more than we did last year--about 6\1/2\ 
or 7 percent. The bill is loaded with parochial benefits, which is the 
pleasure of the appropriators, I understand, but it doesn't pass muster 
in terms of no earmarks.
  But there is one point that I agree with. This has been an agreement 
between Republicans and Democrats to bring the bill to the floor. And 
it will pass because it is an agreement, because people did work 
together. Whether I like it or not, they worked together and came to a 
conclusion. The only problem is there are going to be no amendments, so 
no way to be honest with the American people on this $17.9 billion that 
is supposedly paid but isn't. It is truly an untruth. It is dishonest. 
It has no integrity with it whatsoever. It undermines every Senator up 
here who is going to vote for this bill because you say one thing and 
you are going to do exactly the opposite.
  I was just given a poll as of today. The No. 1 problem Americans see 
in our country is us--the U.S. Government. Twenty-one percent of the 
people in this country identify us as the problem. Is it any wonder, 
when we tell them we are going to do X and then we don't do X? For 
example: We had a budget agreement, and then we changed the budget 
agreement because we couldn't live within our means and we wouldn't 
raise the revenue to be able to do that. Then we come to a new budget 
agreement that is much higher--don't honor the previous budget 
agreement. Then we put an appropriations bill on the floor that is 
going to fund all the Federal Government until September 30 and nobody 
has totally read it. They pick out the things they like in it and then 
talk about it. Is it any wonder why 21 percent of the people think the 
Congress, politicians, poor leadership, corruption, and abuse of power 
in Washington are the No. 1 problem with our country?

  You know what. They are right. It is an abuse of power to vote for a 
bill that you know spends $18 billion--$17.9 billion--more than what 
you are telling the American people it is going to spend. You do it 
through sleight of hand, and you pass muster with the powers that be, 
but it is not honest with the American public. So we are going to do it 
again. We are not going to have a government shutdown, everybody is 
going to get to go home on break and spend a week away from here and 
say: Oh, look at us, we are not at loggerheads anymore.
  The only reason we are at loggerheads is because we have abandoned 
the process of the Senate through the majority leader who does not 
allow the Senate to force consensus. For the life of me, I don't 
understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle accept it. 
They get no amendments either. So we have 1 person out of 100 who 
decides what amendments will be acceptable and what will not.
  Jefferson has to be spinning in his grave because he wrote the 
original rules for the Senate. It had nothing to do with one person 
deciding. As a matter of fact, until 1917, one person stopped 
everything in the Senate if they didn't have consensus. So the whole 
goal was to trade what you would like to do to give somebody else

[[Page S347]]

the ability to do that. When we have a czar running the Senate, we no 
longer have that ability. The whole purpose for having a bicameral 
legislature, with a minority rights provision protecting it, was so we 
would generate consensus so that their views could then be sold to the 
American public.
  This isn't about me being able to offer an amendment. This is about 
the 4 million people in Oklahoma not having a say in the Senate. I 
mean, there are some bright people in Oklahoma who have some good 
ideas. But those ideas cannot be heard in this body anymore. They are 
not my ideas. It is not my vote. It is their vote. And yet 54 of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle acquiesced their right for 
their States to offer their State's ideas as we debate issues in this 
body. They give that away and say one person gets to decide. It has 
never been that way in the Senate--never before.
  The prime example of that is the unemployment bill. If this were 
really a priority for the majority leader, why are we doing it now 
instead of before it expired? All the weeks of time in quorum calls in 
the Senate we could have been doing this. It wasn't a priority. It is a 
political priority.
  I actually think we ought to extend the unemployment insurance, but I 
think we ought to do it in a smarter way, and I certainly think we 
ought to pay for it. I can sit and show $9 trillion of waste and 
spending reductions that 80 percent of average Americans would agree 
with. Yet we can't find $20-some billion out of all this mess of a 
Federal Government to help people who are not employed.
  My colleague from Delaware mentioned job training. The only thing 
that has happened based on the GAO reports of this government on 
duplication is that the House took it to heart and they took the job 
training programs and they converted the 47 job training programs, 
spending almost $30 billion a year, and they passed the SKILLS Act, 
which consolidated those into 6 programs that actually have metrics.
  When you study our job training programs, regardless of whether we 
fund them, here is what you find. All but three of them duplicate one 
another--all but three--and not one of them has a metric on whether 
they are actually training people to do a job, giving them a life 
skill. So the House passes that bill and we won't even take it up. You 
save money and you actually improve what the Federal Government is 
trying to do in terms of that. So if we were to expand unemployment 
insurance or continue the emergency in the sixth year, might we not 
want to do something about the quality of the jobs programs that are 
available for the people who are on unemployment? Might we also not 
want to give people back their dignity by having them do something in 
their community for the earning of that?
  There have been no tax dollars paid by any worker for this program. 
They didn't contribute anything to it through their past unemployment 
or FICA fees. Would we not do better if we did what Norway has done, 
where they show that people will start hunting for a job earlier if you 
plus up the benefits early and taper the benefits later so that they 
start looking for a job long before they run out of benefits? What the 
studies actually show, especially the three States that have now been 
disqualified from this, is their employment numbers went up, their 
unemployment went down, and the number of people needing assistance 
actually went down as well.
  So it is one thing to say we want to help people; it is totally 
different when it is all in a political contest about the next 
election.
  That brings me to my final point. I believe children need to have a 
good start toward school. But as the Senator from Delaware just 
mentioned, we are going to add $1 billion to Head Start, and that is 
going to give us 90,000 new kids in Head Start. If anybody does the 
math on that, $11,000 per year for a Head Start Program? Think about 
that. Give the money to the States and let them run it themselves 
outside of the Federal Government and they will do it for $4,000 or 
$5,000. Because it is a Federal program, it costs twice what it should. 
Or if you did it through the States, you could do $180,000 versus what 
we are doing.
  So we are going to have a debate. Hopefully we will get back to the 
unemployment insurance. But if we want to have that debate, it has to 
be paid for. We owe that to the very people we say we want to help. 
And, No. 2, you have to have the input of everybody, not just one 
person in the Senate.
  I will finish up by saying this: When you see this poll, where 21 
percent of the country thinks the biggest problem in the country is us, 
the government--the corruption, the abuse of power, and the poor 
leadership are the specific things that were mentioned in this poll--
what we ought to do is look inside and ask ourselves: Why is that?
  That is because we concentrate on the political and not on the 
people. We use them as pawns to advantage our own political careers, 
our own elections, and the long-term best interests of the country get 
sacrificed. What this poll shows is the American people are pretty 
darned smart, because they see the problem, they know what it is, and 
they know what is going to happen.
  So we are going to pass a bill that is going to spend over $1 
trillion, with all sorts of favors in there--not truly earmarks, but as 
close to them as you can come--with new programs by the appropriators 
instead of the authorizing committee. That is the other thing in this 
bill, programs written by the Appropriations Committee instead of the 
authorizing committee. We are going to pass this bill, and this number 
is going to jump from 21 percent to 25 percent.
  The jig is up. We can no longer come down here and say with honesty: 
Here is what we are doing. Because what we are doing is not honest. And 
what the American people are saying with this is: Integrity matters, 
straightforwardness matters, truth in budgeting and spending matters.
  At least if we are going to do this, let's own up to what we are 
doing. Let's not be dishonest with the American public about the 
numbers.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking my friend, 
the distinguished Senator from Maryland, as well as her counterpart in 
the House, Chairman Rogers. They have shown great leadership in working 
across the aisle to accomplish this mammoth task we had given them on a 
very tight timeline, and I appreciate their efforts.
  I am here today to talk about why it is important we pass this 
Omnibus appropriations bill and continue to build on the bipartisan 
steps we have taken so far.
  Last week I spoke at a press conference on youth unemployment with a 
young man who was present. His name was James. Listening to James, it 
was pretty clear he was hard-working and ambitious. But he explained to 
me, as old as he is, in his twenties, he is still living at home with 
his parents because despite a lot of searching he has not been able to 
find a job.
  What was clear to me from James' story and from a lot of others 
across the country is that even though the economy has made progress, 
far too many Americans still aren't feeling the benefits. Too many of 
them are working more hours and earning less or wondering whether they 
can afford to send their kids to college or worrying that they won't be 
able to save enough to retire. Those are the kinds of problems we need 
to be thinking about here and solving.
  I hope our work this session, this year, will be entirely focused on 
doing everything we can to create more jobs and more opportunities for 
all Americans, especially those who are struggling in what is still a 
very tough economy. There is a lot we need to get done. If one lesson 
came out of the constant crises last year, it is that in a divided 
government the only way to get things done is through compromise and 
bipartisanship.
  The budget deal Chairman Ryan and I worked together on and reached is 
a good example. It wasn't the bill I would have written on my own. It 
wasn't the bill Chairman Ryan would have written on his own either. But 
after hearing from families and communities in my home State of 
Washington, I knew we needed to do more to restore the critical 
investments that were being lost as a result of sequestration, and we 
needed to break out of the constant crises which have caused so much 
gridlock and dysfunction over the last several years. So I worked with 
Chairman Ryan to reach a compromise. I am

[[Page S348]]

pleased that our agreement rolled back some of those automatic across-
the-board cuts to priorities important to all of us, such as education, 
infrastructure, and research. We did that in a balanced way, without 
relying on spending cuts alone.
  Importantly, in reaching that deal we were able to lay some 
groundwork so Chairman Mikulski and Chairman Rogers could move forward 
on the important work of funding the government. Families and 
communities across the country will be better off as the result of 
their leadership. Their legislation invests in starting our children 
off strongly by expanding access to early Head Start for infants and 
families. It expands access to Pell grants to help more of our young

                   PERSONALIZE YOUR CARE ACT OF 2013

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I started my day with my friend and 
colleague Dr. Phil Roe, a Republican Congressman from Tennessee. We met 
with representatives from the American Academy of Hospice and 
Palliative Medicine. These dedicated professionals deal with helping 
patients and their families contend with some of the most difficult 
circumstances any of us

[[Page H6834]]

will ever face: loved ones in pain with difficult medical conditions at 
the end of life.
  We were discussing legislation that Dr. Roe and I have cosponsored--
the Personalize Your Care Act of 2013, H.R. 1173.
  Despite widespread agreement in principle that individuals should be 
fully involved with decisions related to their health care, too often, 
this is not the reality. Most adults have not completed an advanced 
directive. If documents are completed, they are not regularly revisited 
and can be difficult to locate when needed. Because these issues are 
difficult to discuss, often surrogates feel ill-prepared to interpret 
their loved ones' written wishes. These shortcomings leave families and 
health care proxies faced with the burden of determining their loved 
ones' wishes in the midst of crisis, adding greater stress and anxiety.
  One of the great misconceptions about advanced care planning is that 
it is a onetime event. Attempting to plan for all of the possibilities 
in a single document or within a single conversation is both 
overwhelming and impossible. For advanced care planning to be 
successful, it must become less about legal documentation and more 
about facilitating ongoing communication about the future care wishes 
among individuals, their health care providers and their families.
  This approach recognizes that documents like advance directives and 
physician orders for life-sustaining treatment are not the end but the 
means--the tools--for documenting care preferences based on informed 
decisions that incorporate an individual's values, personal goals and 
current circumstance. This process not only provides higher quality 
care but personalized care. This is the right time to embrace this 
simple, commonsense reform.
  I stepped out of a hearing going on in Ways and Means about the 
Affordable Care Act, which has basically become a contest, an ongoing 
soap opera, not an effort to fix the expensive health care system that 
too often delivers mediocre results. Instead, it is used as a political 
tug of war. The Personalize Your Care Act is a way out of this cul-de-
sac. It is a way that we can come together to empower families, to know 
what they face, to understand their choices, to make their wishes 
known, and to assure their wishes are respected.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to join Dr. Roe and me to cosponsor 
H.R. 1173, the Personalize Your Care Act, and to work with us to 
guarantee this important protection for all American families.

                              HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DeSantis). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 3, 2013, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, thank you for the time.
  I don't have to tell you all that there is a debate raging in our 
country about the future of health care. I want to share, first of all, 
a story that I received by email from Yvonne who lives in the town of 
Firth, Nebraska, right near me. She says this:

       We are a farming family of five in southeast Nebraska and 
     recently received notification from Blue Cross/Blue Shield of 
     Nebraska--an insurance company--that our insurance premiums 
     are increasing from $578 per month to $1,092 per month. That 
     is $514 more, resulting from the misnamed ``Affordable Care 
     Act.''

  Yvonne goes on and says:

       Even if I play with the numbers and drop our family income 
     to be eligible for subsidies, my family has never needed 
     government assistance in the past to pay for health 
     insurance. Why should we need it now, other than Washington's 
     interference? Would you please tell me how I am supposed to 
     find an extra $500 in my monthly budget to afford this new 
     improved policy.

  Mark, who lives in Lincoln, says he is 49. He said he had his 
insurance canceled, and he had a very good policy. And this is what he 
had to say:

       I had a $5,000 deductible policy; and after that, 
     everything was covered. My policy was not a junk insurance 
     policy. And it was canceled.

                              {time}  1845

  Mr. Speaker, many Americans are awakening to sticker shock and are 
feeling, frankly, very betrayed by the earlier comments that if you 
like your health care plan, you can keep it. Clearly, there is a 
significant problem here. And what has happened?
  Well, Mr. Speaker, we need the right type of health care reform--
health care that is actually going to reduce costs and improve outcomes 
while also protecting vulnerable persons. But what we have gotten 
instead through the new law is a shift of cost to more unsustainable 
spending by government, a shift of cost from one American to

[[Page H7248]]

another; and we also have a serious erosion of health care liberties.
  This is another email that I received from Joan. She talked about her 
son. She has maintained her son's policy--a young man--in case of a 
catastrophic event so it would not be a burden to the hospital.
  She said:

       He does not make enough money to file taxes, but his 
     premium goes from $85 to $220. So my son will no longer have 
     insurance of any kind. My son's new policy is required by law 
     to include things he can never, ever use--maternity for a 
     male and pediatric services for an adult. Please at least 
     allow the insurance carriers to call this what it is--an 
     insurance subsidy from my son to others.

  This young man is 30 years old. I don't know the circumstances of the 
family as to why they are providing a policy for their 30-year-old son, 
but clearly the family is trying to do the right thing and help one 
another; but they are being forced by escalating costs to reconsider 
the very idea of carrying health insurance themselves and doing the 
right thing.
  Mr. Speaker, when I was a much younger man in my twenties, I had an 
individual insurance policy that I bought. I thought it was the right 
thing to do. I didn't want to impose the risk of my own health care 
needs--in case something went wrong--on the rest of society. And I 
bought this policy. It was a pretty big burden to carry for someone in 
their twenties. It was fairly expensive. So I decided to raise the 
deductible to $1,000 to basically help better manage the costs.
  Well, one day I had a very severe headache, and it just didn't seem 
to go away; and as this went on, I decided it was necessary for me to 
seek medical attention.
  So thinking about it, I decided to simply bypass the family doctor, 
assuming that they would probably refer me to the ear, nose, and throat 
specialist. And so I made an appointment with the ENT doctor, probably 
saving myself about $50 by simply going to the specialist.
  When I got there, she examined me and they took an x-ray. Afterward, 
the doctor said, I really can't tell from the x-ray what the problem 
is. I'm going to need to do a CAT scan. I interrupted her at that 
moment and injected in the conversation and said, Doctor, I understand 
if you might be worried about liability and there might be this test 
that is normal protocol for you to run. She interrupted me and said, 
Why are you saying this to me? I said, Because I need to know if you 
really need this test. I'm actually paying for it.
  Again, I had the $1,000 deductible.
  She said, Oh, let's think about this. I'm only looking at your 
sinuses. So that means that we could probably ask one of the two 
entities in town with a CT scan machine if they will widen the cross-
section and let's see if they'll give you a discount for doing that.
  So she asked her assistant to help. They called both places in town, 
found out the price, found out if they would lower the price based upon 
a wider cross-section for this test, and one of them did. And I don't 
remember the exact amount, but I think it was $75.
  Mr. Speaker, I saved $75 by simply asking a simple question. The 
doctor got the test that she needed and the community resource was more 
properly allocated, all because I had the incentive to watch the cost.
  This is one of the problems here that we have in the whole health 
care debate. Because, again, the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called 
ObamaCare--and there are a lot of people who want to move away from 
that expression ``ObamaCare,'' and I respect that, because it has 
always seemed to me to be a bit disrespectful toward the President, so 
let's call it the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act shifts 
costs to more government spending and actually is moving costs from one 
individual to another.
  Now, how did we get here?
  Well, you remember in the Bush administration the number that was 
being talked about was that there were 50 million Americans who were 
uninsured. It has been a while now since I looked at that statistic. 
From memory, as I recall, that was actually an aggregate statistic that 
reflected the number of people within a year who had some trouble 
accessing affordable, quality health insurance. It was not necessarily 
a snapshot in time.
  So the number might have been bigger than what was suggested, but it 
laid the ground work for where we are now. Of course, President Obama 
and the administration used that number as well; but when you parse the 
number down and look at Americans who were having problems accessing 
affordable, quality health insurance, whether because of preexisting 
condition or some other issue, that number may have come down to 
perhaps 10 million to 15 million persons.
  Now that is a real problem. That is a lot of people who need help. 
And the right response is to engage in policy debate that will actually 
help them access affordable, quality health insurance; but we have done 
so by turning the entire health care system inside out. And it is 
creating havoc, sticker shock; and many Americans are feeling betrayed, 
particularly those who are buying their insurance in the open market, 
the individual market.
  Soon, many more will be receiving the price shock who have employer-
based insurance because of a couple of factors. And what are those 
factors?
  First of all, in the new law what has happened is there is a 
shrinkage of the age ratio. It used to be six categories, as I recall--
now it is three--by which you can price the product. That means younger 
people are actually subsidizing older people. You can have a debate 
about the merits of that, but that is one of the cost drivers.
  Secondly, there are all types of new mandated benefits. You heard it 
in the emails that I received. First of all, a very young man is having 
his insurance rates skyrocket simply because he is a young male. In 
Nebraska, we have one of the highest rate increases for single males. 
It is second only to Arkansas. It is 220-plus percent, as I recall.
  Why is that? We were somewhat a less regulated State, if you will. 
But what that created were market conditions whereby a young person who 
was relatively healthy could get an affordable, quality health 
insurance policy that protected them from catastrophic incidents. If 
they were in an accident or an unfortunate disease happened to strike 
them, they were covered; but now it is pushing those policies to a 
level where people are questioning as to whether or not they can afford 
it. A policy designed to help people is hindering those who have been 
doing the right thing from purchasing insurance.
  The mandated benefits issue: as the older gentleman writing me 
pointed out, I don't need maternity services. Again, those were 
incorporated into the law. An inability to customize an insurance 
policy based upon one's particular needs after us deciding what is a 
reasonable set of basic coverages that are necessary, which used to 
occur State by State.

  The third is no denials. Now, this one is a little bit more sensitive 
because, again, we do have Americans who are being held by this law and 
who had previously been either denied because of preexisting conditions 
or, for one reason or another, were having problems accessing 
affordable, quality health insurance.
  So as we move forward into a debate as to how we are going to reform 
the system and perhaps get this right, it is necessary that we carry 
forward either this way or another way. It used to be the government's 
subsidy of high-risk pools in which we allowed people to have access to 
more affordable insurance. Either that way or the way whereby we all 
absorb the cost across insurance policies and that we take care of 
people who rightfully need access.
  And so there are a few embedded policies in this Affordable Care Act 
that do make some sense. The first one was allowing young people to 
stay on their parents' policies a little bit longer--until the age of 
26. I supported that before the Affordable Care Act made sense. It 
replenishes your insurance pool, helps enculturate the concept of 
buying insurance at a young age, and hopefully that carries forward 
into creating a more robust, dynamic marketplace.
  Second is, again, dealing appropriately with people who have 
preexisting conditions. There are a lot of ways to do that--either, 
again, by subsidizing the market directly, since it was somewhat 
broken, or absorbing the cost across all insurance products.
  The third issue was removing insurance caps for those who actually

[[Page H7249]]

bumped up to their total maximum benefit.
  I know of cases where families were struggling with a severe disease 
condition that would meet their insurance cap. The response was they 
simply had to leave their job and go find another job and get employer-
based insurance to basically start the clock over. That doesn't save 
the system any money. It just burdens the family.
  So those are three aspects of the current health care bill that makes 
some sense, but we did not have to do so by turning the entire system 
inside out and harming disproportionately large numbers of Americans 
who have been doing the right thing: protecting themselves and not 
relying on society for the imputed costs of their own health care risk; 
who were trying in a marketplace to find the right product for 
themselves, but now who have lost access to basic products like good 
catastrophic coverage, which will lower costs for younger people. That 
is a very strong disincentive for young people to actually enter the 
insurance market, and that needs to be corrected.
  I think it is also part of our responsibility, for those of us who 
have said ``no'' to the Affordable Care Act and who have said there are 
better ways to reform the health care system to start laying out some 
specifics.
  Well, one of the specifics should be that we all ought to try to 
agree that the health savings account idea is a way in which we form a 
hybrid model that actually benefits the marketplace, benefits 
individuals, and retains the robustness of what private market 
competition can give you.
  Let's take, for instance, the case of the surgical procedure called 
LASIK. Now, I am not aware of insurance policies that regularly carry 
that procedure whereby the eye is operated on to correct vision. Large 
numbers of Americans have been helped by this extraordinary 
technological invention. And it appears to me from a cursory look at 
that market that prices have fallen, outcomes have improved, and the 
doctors who do this surgery seem to do pretty well with basically no 
insurance involved.
  So let's look at the health savings account model as a hybrid model 
whereby we retain the government subsidy in a certain sense by allowing 
people to set aside an account on a tax-free basis and they accumulate 
monies that go toward their first dollar of health care costs, taking 
better control over those first dollars that are expended.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, I recently had a medical issue. I had a sore spot 
on my ear. I didn't think much about it, but after about 3 weeks of it 
being there, I thought at my age maybe it is good to get that checked.
  So I went to the dermatologist, and he looked at it and he said, 
Jeff, I think this is 50-50 it may be a cancerous-type condition. I 
said, All right. He said, I'm going to put you on a medicine that we 
can go ahead and get started now while we wait for the biopsy to come 
back.
  So I went to the pharmacist to get the medicine. My co-pay was $5. I 
am very grateful for that. It was very easy for me, and I am thankful I 
had the insurance to be able to do this. It was $5.
  I asked the pharmacist, How much does this medicine cost? He said, I 
don't know. Let me check. He came back and said, It's $500. I said, 
Well, this is Friday. I'm not sure on Monday if I'm going to need this 
medicine or not. It's 50-50. Maybe we just ought to wait, And I chose 
to wait.
  So on Monday the doctor called back and said it was benign--not 
cancerous--nothing to worry about, and I didn't have to take the 
medicine.
  Well, I had no incentive not to take the medicine. The doctor didn't 
necessarily think through the question with me. He didn't have to 
because my co-pay was $5. Again, I am grateful for that. But the point 
being that $495 of waste would have occurred in the system had I not 
simply asked a question, and I didn't have an incentive to ask a 
question. I was simply trying to make sure that we weren't imprudently 
using that much medicine when it may go to waste; and I am glad I 
turned it down.
  Again, that is the point. If you have your own health savings 
account, which is coupled with a catastrophic policy, two things are 
occurring at once: first of all, you are controlling your first dollar 
costs. You have a normal conversation with your doctor about ordinary 
health care. Is this the pathway we need to go? What are our 
alternatives? Who can provide those in town--maybe at a cheaper rate, 
with the same quality?
  For that, we need price transparency in medicine. It is an important 
part of market reform that needs to occur. But if something really goes 
wrong and you are on the hospital gurney getting rolled into an 
operating room, you shouldn't have to pull off your mask and say, Can 
somebody give me the price of the anesthesia around here? That is not 
the point. That is different. That is a catastrophic condition. With 
catastrophic insurance, you should be protected from having to worry 
about those market dynamics.
  So I think this is a good hybrid model whereby, again, the government 
incents you to put a little bit of money aside in a tax-free account 
which, by the way, can accumulate over time. Most people don't get sick 
in their life, and a lot of this money could grow to a substantial 
amount over time and actually be a supplement in retirement or a 
supplement to Medicare. We have got long-term cost problems in the 
Medicare program.

                              {time}  1900

  So, again, it is thinking dynamically, creatively as to how we 
restructure health care and give improved opportunities for a robust 
marketplace for health insurance that doesn't just consolidate the 
marketplace into fewer and fewer companies. It has been suggested that 
what is happening now is this is becoming like a utility system whereby 
there are going to be a few insurance carriers that work with 
hospitals, and that is it. The government will have a role in setting 
certain rates, and that is it. So you lose the dynamic of the 
competitive model for the insurance market. We should protect people's 
access. We should allow people to have access to affordable, quality 
insurance and not simply be denied for preexisting conditions. There 
are a lot of ways to do that. If we do that, we can keep the market 
dynamic basis for controlling health care costs.
  We do this in all other areas of our lives, and it is normal to us. 
There is no reason that we have to put on blinders when we are dealing 
with ordinary health care costs and simply submit to the system 
whatever they tell us to do. There is no reason for that. What we could 
see--again, if we inject this sort of competitive marketplace for 
ordinary costs--is competition in the marketplace for ordinary 
processes and procedures in medicine, for drugs. Then you could see, 
like in the LASIK surgery example, prices falling, innovation 
occurring, and a health care system making reasonable returns for its 
efforts. Right now, we have a health care system that is very, very 
frightened. Doctors are very frightened of the next steps in terms of 
the evolving dynamic of the Affordable Care Act. You have many doctors 
who are saying they are not going to be able to afford to take on any 
more Medicare patients. You already have this problem in Medicaid. So 
you want a robust, dynamic market in which people are innovating, in 
which costs are falling, and in which health care outcomes are 
improving.
  Health Savings Accounts give people the opportunity to control that 
first-dollar cost, but if they are really sick or have an accident, 
they are protected and don't have to worry about those costs. That 
makes a lot of sense to me, Mr. Speaker. In the Affordable Care Act, 
unfortunately, though, what we have is a dampening of the marketplace 
for the Health Savings Account idea. It ought to be exactly the 
opposite. Now, there is a reasonable argument that some have made that 
this is not appropriate for people who are older, who have increasing 
health care costs, and who don't have the time to set enough money 
aside to meet their normal, ordinary expenses--fair enough--but it is 
an important model that we should be eagerly embracing for the young 
generation so that they can have affordable, quality catastrophic 
insurance, so that they have incentive to move into the market, and so 
that the market responds to their questions as to:
  Why does this cost this much? Who is providing the best service? Does 
this really make sense?
  With our simply trying with the diminished marketplace and with a 
lack

[[Page H7250]]

of incentive to actually watch those first-dollar costs that the Health 
Savings Account gives us, then there are not really those incentives 
to, again, force transparency and to ask simple questions as to how you 
best manage the resources that you have in partnership with the medical 
community, like I did when I was trying to reduce my own costs for that 
CAT scan. The doctor very willingly accommodated my request, and that 
community resource was better allocated.
  To me, that is a commonsense solution that we all ought to be 
embracing. Instead, what we have now is a huge shift of cost to more 
unsustainable government spending and to many Americans being 
disproportionately hurt because of skyrocketing premiums or because 
they are losing the health care that they were promised they could 
keep. Now, that is simply not fair. There is a better way to fix this 
system.
  In the last few weeks, because of the problematic rollout of the 
marketplace Web site--the ``exchange'' as it is called--it has brought 
more and more attention to this issue. It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that 
we just don't get into finger-pointing and ``we told you so,'' for 
those of us who are against this, but that we actually sit down and try 
to construct something that is much more reasonable and fruitful for 
the entire system.
  Mr. Speaker, the formal definition of a ``law'' is: an ordinance of 
reason given by those in authority for the common good. You have a real 
question here as to the reasonableness of this law, because it is so 
unfairly and disproportionately hurting a lot of people, and whether 
that meets the definition of its being for the common good.
  As I suggested, there are aspects of the current law that we can 
retain--keeping young people on insurance longer, removing the caps on 
insurance, and protecting people who have preexisting conditions. Those 
should be retained, I feel; but as we move forward with a robust 
debate, we ought to keep in mind: let's do everything--let's do all we 
can--to give America a better path forward, the path that they deserve, 
so that any health care reform meets the true definition of a truly 
just law in that it promotes the common good, which means society's 
well-being.
  What does that common good look like?
  It is a vibrant marketplace for affordable, quality insurance. 
Persons who have had a condition shouldn't be denied. There should be a 
dynamic by which the person controls his first-dollar cost because he 
owns those dollars, and he is protected, if something really goes 
wrong, through catastrophic policies.
  That shift to the health care paradigm could lend itself to the right 
type of reform for the next generation for Medicare, for instance. If 
you have had a huge savings account accumulate over time because you 
are not one of the unfortunate--you are one of the majority of people 
who, fortunately, does not get stricken by something serious over your 
lifetime--then you will be able to potentially use that money for your 
own well-being and retirement or as a further supplement to the 
Medicare program.
  This is what is called ``thinking outside the box.'' Let's think 
dynamically as to how these programs can mutually reinforce one 
another--the current health care reform and our important health safety 
nets in retirement. That is what we ought to be thinking about.
  So, Mr. Speaker, I just submit these comments this evening because I 
think it is important to try to unpack what has gone wrong and why and 
to frame the debate in a manner that is actually constructive so that 
America gets the type of health care reform that we deserve--a robust 
health care system that leads the world, that improves health care 
outcomes while reducing costs, and that also protects vulnerable 
persons.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk for a few minutes today 
about health care and more inquiries I have from the people I work for 
in our State about health care. Like we always do, I followed up with 
them to verify that I understand their account, and they don't mind if 
I at least mention their first name and where they are from as we talk 
about these problems.
  This morning I had a chance to speak to the American Federation of 
Hospitals about the challenges we face, and I mentioned the comment I 
made on the floor a few days ago, which was: If we were dealing with 
this health care debate today, in my view it would be a much different 
debate. Every Member of the House, every Member of the Senate, and 
almost every American who has been impacted in any way by the changes 
in health care understands this a whole lot better than we may have 
understood it 4 years ago.
  I was in the House in 2009 and was leading our effort to come up with 
the alternatives that were clearly out there that I think we could 
have, and, frankly, should have pursued. But at that time it was clear 
a lot of Members had not really thought about this, and in many cases 
people who worked thought about it even less. We had a situation that, 
in many ways, was an accidental development at the end of World War II 
where most people in America who had insurance got their insurance at 
work. If the people at work liked the insurance they had, of course, 
among other things, they hoped they would be able to keep it. Hopefully 
many of them will, but clearly many of them won't.
  The letters I have today are reflective of all kinds of challenges 
people are seeing. One of the things that was working very well in the 
almost 40 States that had it was the high-risk pool. The high-risk pool 
allowed people who had preexisting conditions a way to get insurance. 
They were in a pool that was pretty well defined. Not everybody with a 
preexisting condition had an ongoing cost. You might have a condition 
that was under control, you might have had a heart problem or cancer 
problem or another problem that stood in the way of your getting other 
insurance, but it didn't mean you had a lot of ongoing costs. It did 
mean the high-risk pool was a place you could go.
  In our State, the premium for the people in the high-risk pool was 
135 percent of what everybody else was paying. So you would take the 
average rate of what people were paying for insurance and add 35 
percent to that.
  Remember, these were people who everybody understood--including 
them--had a preexisting condition. They had a place to go. If the new 
plan would have reduced that 35 percent back to what everybody else was 
paying, that might have been a worthy goal, but that doesn't appear to 
be what has happened at all to the 4,000 people who left the Missouri 
high-risk pool when it ended because of the new law on December 31 of 
last year. There was a transition for some of them.
  I have a letter from Bjorn of Kansas City. He said his wife was 
previously insured under the Missouri Health Insurance Pool for 
preexisting conditions. In her case she had a back condition. That was 
canceled in the middle of 2012, and she was put in another high-risk 
pool that the law allowed to happen as a transition.
  The problem that created for them was it reset their $1,000 
deductible. They met the $1,000 in the high-risk pool, and they met the 
$1,000 deductible again in the second half of that year.
  The insurance they have been able to find costs them four times what 
they were paying before. It is not 135 percent of the old premium. I 
guess four times that would be 550 percent of the old premium. So 
somebody who was paying 135 percent of what used to be the normal 
premium for an individual is now paying 550 percent of what used to be 
the premium for the old individual. If that was the way to help people 
who had a preexisting condition, they better hope the Federal 
Government doesn't try to help them any more.
  Mark, from Parkville, says his two sons--young and healthy as they 
were, according to him--just had a 20-percent increase in the policies 
they had. The only reason they were given for the increase was that the 
new requirements of the Affordable Care Act meant their premium would 
go up. Mark said he lived out of the country for 2 years and was amazed 
to find upon his return that the cost for the same type of health 
coverage he had before he left went up from $250 a month to $1,000 a 
month.
  Bill, from St. James, MO, said his deductible went from $1,000 to 
$2,500.
  In Missouri, West Virginia, and lots of places, you and I know that 
if the individual deductible is $2,500, a family looks at that--that is 
just like not having insurance at all. If a couple of you happen to get 
sick that year, it is suddenly $5,000.
  I met with some Missouri hospital folks last week in St. Louis. They 
said their fastest growing uncollected debt was now among people with 
insurance. Why would that be? Because people with insurance suddenly 
have a deductible that is much higher than the average person with 
insurance used to have.
  The point they were making was that people can't pay $2,500 or $3,000 
or $5,000 or an even higher deductible, so that part of the bill 
doesn't get paid. That is the new growing debt that hospitals have.
  These people who have the high deductibles are insured for maybe lots 
of things they didn't used to be insured for, but they don't use any of 
the things they are now insured for that they didn't used to be insured 
for. Bill from St. James says:

       ObamaCare sure has not helped us.
       I work for a small business that has renewed my healthcare 
     and my deductible has risen from $1,000 to $2,500. My visits 
     went from a $20 copay to a $30 copay and specialists from $50 
     copay to $75 copay.

  He says he doesn't understand how he is helped by the new health care 
law.
  Carl, in Lee's Summit, MO, said he has type 1 diabetes and his 
deductible went up to $7,500. Again, for most families, a $7,500 
deductible is like not having insurance at all. If we could go

[[Page S1265]]

back to where we had the health savings account where you had a high 
deductible and you had your health savings account and that high 
deductible would kick in only if you had to pay the high deductible--I 
never saw a health savings account plan that would not be cheaper than 
these plans that cover a lot of things, but they cover a lot of things 
a lot of people don't need.
  Carl says:

       To keep our premium rates down my employer had to raise our 
     deductible to $7,500 with no prescription benefit until it is 
     met, so now instead of putting away $400 per month for my 
     retirement I have to spend it on insulin and diabetic 
     supply's.
       How is this ACA helping any honest working American who is 
     trying to take care of themselves and not rely on the 
     government?

  Carl's point is that the money he used to spend to prepare for his 
own retirement he now spends to pay for his insulin and diabetes 
medicine that used to be covered--until this year--by his policy.
  Christine, from Kansas City, said her husband's employer was forced 
to make changes in their insurance resulting in a deductible that went 
from $1,300 to $6,100.
  If this had been the way we would explain this, that somehow--let's 
assume we are insuring more people. There is no reason to believe that 
yet, but let's assume we are, but we are insuring more people with what 
I have here today--a $7,500 deductible, a $6,100 and a $2,500 
deductible.
  She says:

       Our deductible went from a manageable $1,300 to a 
     devastating $6,100.
       I recently sent in scripts for my Dr and I can't imagine 
     how much they will be. We were told they would be between $25 
     & $200 depending on the cost of the drug.

  Remember, they are all before you get the deductible.
  I have a letter from Fred from Columbia. He says that a drug company 
that makes one of his prescriptions no longer offers him a discount. 
The pharmacy told him it was because of the Affordable Care Act.
  I am perfectly willing to believe the Affordable Care Act has become 
an excuse for some things, and this may be one of them. I have not 
talked to the pharmacy in this case, but I do know these are problems 
other individuals are having because their insurance doesn't cover what 
it used to cover.
  Fred is a retired State employee and he said his plan doesn't offer 
as much coverage as it used to.
  Houston and Shirley from Peculiar, MO, have a supplemental health 
insurance. Their supplemental health insurance increased by $330 since 
the Affordable Care Act was passed. They said their policy increased 
$149--this is their supplemental policy.
  They say:

       Senator Blunt, we are on Medicare and have a supplemental 
     health insurance. Our monthly premiums were a little less 
     than $165 [prior to the ACA's passage in 2010], and now as of 
     January 1, 2014, is $498.40. Our premium has increased by 
     $149.55 a month.

  That is for their supplemental insurance.
  Just last week Medicare Advantage, which serves people in underserved 
areas--whether they live in the inner cities or rural communities--has 
had that competition reduced as well.
  I will say that if there were ever a time when we should take a 
second look at something--and the facts that every one of us have in 
our office suggest we take a look at it, and even demand we take a look 
at it--it is this policy that is hurting Americans and hurting 
families.
  If we had this debate again, the country, the health care providers, 
and the Congress of the United States would be a whole lot better 
prepared to talk about what needs to be talked about than apparently 
the Congress was prepared to talk about in 2009 and 2010.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.

             REPEALING THE JOB-KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                         HON. YVETTE D. CLARKE

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 19, 2011

  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 2, a bill that would repeal the Healthcare Law.
  In the United States, one of the richest countries in the world, 
nearly 50 million Americans lack health insurance, 13.5 percent of 
which are New Yorkers. Last year alone, New York City's hospitals spent 
1.2 billion dollars in charity costs. Tragically, people who are either 
uninsured or underinsured often have to go without vital healthcare 
simply because they cannot afford it.
  Every American has a human right to adequate physical and mental 
healthcare, and I believe that government has a responsibility to 
assist its citizens in securing quality healthcare.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed in the 
111th Congress, does just that. It insures that Americans have access 
to quality healthcare. Repealing it would mean:
  Insurance companies will once again be able to drop coverage for 
people when they get sick--exactly when coverage is needed most;
  Children with pre-existing conditions will be denied coverage;
  Insurance companies would again be able to impose devastating annual 
and lifetime caps;
  Young people will no longer be able to stay on their parents' plans 
until age 26;
  Pregnant women would be denied coverage simply because they are 
pregnant since pregnancy is considered a ``pre-existing condition'' and 
therefore a basis for denial of coverage;
  And finally, seniors will face an increase in their prescription drug 
costs because they

[[Page E87]]

would be thrown back into the Medicare Part D Donut Hole, which the 
healthcare reform law would have closed by 2020.
  Let me share with you a letter that I received from one of my 
constituents in the 11th Congressional District of New York. Jonathan 
writes:
  ``I am a two-time cancer survivor, constantly worrying about being 
denied coverage because of my pre-existing condition. I'm not 
comfortable that corporations under the old rules would consider me 
``unprofitable''. I think it's a disgrace that this problem has existed 
in our country. I, for one, will move to Canada or elsewhere if 
Healthcare Reform is repealed and I ever have a reoccurrence of my 
cancer. Meanwhile, I think it's every American's responsibility to not 
allow other people with pre-existing conditions to be denied coverage. 
``
  As Jonathan notes, this repeal would once again allow big insurance 
companies, who are only focused on profitability, to deny coverage to 
him and so many others with pre-existing conditions.
  Are we going to allow Jonathan to be punished and denied coverage 
simply for being a cancer survivor? Repeal of this healthcare law would 
punish so many.
  Healthcare is a fundamental human right, rather than a commodity, 
which is why I stand in strong opposition to repeal.

KEEP STUDENT LOANS AFFORDABLE ACT OF 2013--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.
  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the 
conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Utah be recognized.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. REED. I wish to thank the Senator from Utah for graciously 
allowing me to proceed.
  While the Republicans failed to join us in an effort to avert the 
doubling of the interest rate on need-based student loans, there is 
still time to act to make things right for students. On July 1, the 
interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans doubled from 3.4 percent to 
6.8 percent. Instead of allowing us to take up a vote on an extension 
of the lower rate, the other side continues to push a so-called long-
term solution that would saddle students with even more debt in the 
future.
  Students and advocates from across the country have been very clear. 
On June 21, they wrote to Senate leadership, and in their words: ``A 
bad deal that is permanent for student borrowers is worse than no deal 
at all.''
  We need time to work together to develop a good deal for students--
one that is comprehensive, one that touches not on just rates but on 
incentives to lower the costs of a college education and on ways in 
which students can refinance their existing debt and their future 
debts. As we all understand, we have reached a point where student debt 
has exceeded credit card debt. It is the second largest household 
debt--$1 trillion--and it is saddling this generation and future 
generations with burdens they well might not be able to discharge.
  In the meantime, at this moment, we should take up and pass the Keep 
Student Loans Affordable Act which I have offered, along with Senator 
Hagan and 41 of our colleagues, to ensure that students with the 
greatest financial need do not see the interest rate on their loans 
double. Again, at the heart of our student lending program has been a 
special concern to allow young men and women with talent from low and 
moderate incomes to go to college. That is why we created the 
subsidized Stafford loan program. That is what we have to keep our 
focus and emphasis on today. Forty-nine organizations representing 
students, educators, colleges and universities, and workers from across 
the country have asked us to do this. These are the students, the 
universities, and the people who have most at stake and they are 
telling us, again, that a bad deal is worse than no deal at all.
  We should take a step back and remember why we offer student loans in 
the first place. When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Higher 
Education Act into law in 1965, he said: ``And it is a truism education 
is no longer a luxury. Education in this day and age is a necessity.''
  His words are truer today than they were in 1965. According to 
Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, we will 
fall 5 million

[[Page S5544]]

short of the workers with postsecondary credentials we will need by 
2020. We already know there is going to be a gap between the workers we 
need with advanced degrees and the jobs available by 2020. Nearly two-
thirds of new jobs will require a college degree or similar credential. 
So by saddling this generation with additional costs and thereby 
inhibiting those who may well have the talent but not the resources to 
go to college, we are going to create an even bigger divergence between 
the demand for skilled workers and the talent Americans need to develop 
to fill those jobs.
  President Johnson again referred to the Higher Education Act as a 
promise the Nation was making to its young people for generations to 
come. The promise was that this Nation was not going to allow financial 
barriers to keep willing and able young people from a college 
education. But, today, that promise is at risk.
  As I have indicated, the job market increasingly demands 
postsecondary education simply to achieve middle-class earnings. At the 
same time, college is getting more and more expensive. As I said also, 
student loan debt is accelerating, second only to mortgage debt for 
American households. This is going to have a huge impact on the overall 
economy of this country. It is not going to be just individual students 
and families struggling. The Federal Reserve of New York and others 
have reported that this debt is dragging down our economy especially 
for young families as they try to establish themselves.
  The primary tools in the Higher Education Act to help students pay 
for college are grants, work study, and low-cost loans. The Pell grant, 
which I must say we are so proud of because it was authored and 
championed by our great Senator Claiborne Pell, is less and less able 
to fund a college education. In the 1970s, it covered a large part of 
tuition and fees for a year in college. Today, the percentage of costs 
it covers is shrinking, even as we try to expand it. As a result, more 
and more students have had to rely on loans, and that is why we have 
seen this huge explosion of debt.
  Today, instead of aiding students with low-cost loans, the Federal 
Government, ironically, is reaping profits from these students. We have 
to change this.
  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that between now and 2023, 
student loans will generate $184 billion in revenue for the Federal 
Government. At a time when students are struggling and when they are 
seeing their debt explode, we are making money off of them--not 
investing in them but putting them under a huge financial burden.
  As we seek to solve these complex problems, I think the most sensible 
and the wisest thing to do is to keep the subsidized loan rate at 3.4 
percent and use the year to engage and successfully complete the 
complex task of looking at several different aspects of this problem.
  However, we are blocked from doing so because our budget rules 
basically require us to replace the revenue and the other side has been 
unwilling to consider revenue from other sources. We propose to offset 
the cost by closing a tax loophole. We have to look carefully not only 
at what we will do to make the student loan programs cheaper and more 
effective for students but also how we will pay for it.
  We also have to recognize that for many years our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle have targeted some of these subsidized loans, 
wanting to make them more expensive. From the Contract With America in 
the 1990s to the Ryan budgets, they have suggested things such as, for 
example, eliminating the in-school interest subsidy on student loans. 
For subsidized student loans, we pay the interest while the student is 
in college pursuing their educational goals, and they have suggested 
eliminating that. These are some of the reasons why I think we have to 
be skeptical of proposals that are being advanced in order to provide 
relief for students.
  The so-called Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act would add nearly 
$1 billion in additional revenues from student loans to the government 
coffers. It may be a short-term fix, but it creates a much larger long-
term problem: The teaser rates in the first few years mask the uncapped 
rates students would face in the following decades.
  This chart is very revealing. This demonstrates the undergraduate 
Stafford loan interest rates under the so-called Bipartisan Student 
Loan Certainty Act. This green line is the graduate Stafford loan, and 
this is the PLUS loan for parents. As we can see, they accelerate 
dramatically because of the 10-year Treasury bill rate chosen by 
supporters of the other proposal and because of the likely increase in 
that rate. It reaches the point here where interest rates exceed 
current law in 2016. So by 2016, these loans will be much more 
expensive. This is a classic case of enjoying 2 or 3 years of low 
interest, but having to be prepared to pay a lot more for education in 
the future. It is eerily reminiscent of those proposals to refinance 
one's house with an adjustable rate uncapped mortgage and get rid of 
that old-fashioned fixed rate which was so prevalent in the first 
decade of the 2000s and which caused so much havoc, and still is 
causing so much havoc.
  CBO estimates that if we look from 2017 to 2023 alone, students will 
pay $37.8 billion more under the so-called Bipartisan Student Loan 
Certainty Act.
  Students are smart. They can figure it out. But I think there is 
something else we have to add to the mix. This chart shows an estimate 
of the rates that was made a few weeks ago on the previous chart. Here 
is the change in the daily yield for the 10-year T-note. This is the 
benchmark rate. We can see where it begins on May 1 of 2013. It is 
going from about 1.6 percent all the way up to about 2.6 percent. This 
rate is rising dramatically. Why? Well, for one reason, the Federal 
Reserve has indicated they are going to begin to taper off their 
quantitative easing program. One reason is as we see signs of growth in 
the economy, interest rates will rise naturally. So what we could find 
is that this chart actually underestimates the potential growth in 
interest rates and students could end up paying maybe much more.
  In the Republican proposal, there is no cap on these rates.
  They talk about the fact that there is a consolidation process, but 
that consolidation process can only be entered into after a student has 
gone through school, begun repayment, accumulated interest at 
increasing rates each year, and then, indeed, when a student goes into 
the consolidation phase, all of the interest is capitalized and the 
loan is stretched out over many years, meaning they end up paying more. 
So it is not a rate cap at all. Frankly, without a rate cap, I think we 
are exposing students and their families to vast uncertainty. In fact, 
the only thing that seems to be certain is these rates are going up.
  We have to approach this problem in a thoughtful way. That is why I 
introduced the Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act with Senator 
Durbin. It is a long-term proposal. It would base student loan interest 
rates on the actual cost of running the student loan programs--not on 
arbitrary rate but the actual cost to the government--and it will 
protect students by capping interest rates on each of the individual 
loan programs. Our proposal would, in effect, pass on the savings to 
students that the Federal Government accrues from the low cost of 
borrowing relative to other borrowers, our ability to absorb risk 
relative to others, and the economies of scale for loan servicing for 
students across this country.
  Additionally, by increasing in this legislation the loan limits on 
subsidized loans, we will allow students of low and moderate income to 
receive more help and not require them to borrow unsubsidized loans at 
higher interest rates and, as a result, I think, help bring down the 
whole cascading issue of student debt.
  Finally, our legislation would provide relief to students with 
outstanding loans--that is upwards of $1 trillion nationally--by 
allowing them to refinance to a lower interest rate.
  These are some of the key elements for a true long-term solution.
  We also need to address the cost of college, which is going up 
astronomically. The institutions have to have a lot more at stake. They 
have to be very careful that they are not only selecting well-qualified 
students, but also that they are preparing them for the workforce of 
this century and that they can

[[Page S5545]]

have certainty, and the students can have certainty, that the skills 
they master in college will be rewarded with a job in our economy.
  Finally, we have to establish a true Federal-State partnership. 
Federal grants and loans can't keep pace with these rising college 
costs. We have to work with every level of government to try to address 
these issues.
  What I would suggest is that we work together. First, we extend the 
3.4-percent interest rate, then, consciously, deliberately, and 
expeditiously, I hope, move forward to fix these complex issues, 
protect our students, allow education to be once again the engine that 
moves the country ahead, and allow every American, regardless of their 
wealth, to get aboard that train and go forward.
  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators be permitted 
to speak for up to 10 minutes each and that Senator Hatch be permitted 
to speak for up to 15 minutes.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The Senator from Utah is recognized.
  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.
  (The remarks of Senator Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 
1270 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced 
Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.
  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I take the floor today to follow up on 
what my good friend and colleague Senator Reed from Rhode Island just 
spoke about; that is, the looming interest rate hike on student loans 
that is confronting us in this country.
  To recap a little bit, in 2002 the Congress passed a fixed rate. We 
had variable rates before, but it passed a fixed rate on student loans 
of 6.8 percent. In 2007 it was lowered. That lasted for about 5 years, 
and then it was going to go back up to the fixed rate of 6.8 percent 
last year. The Congress passed a 1-year extension of that at 3.4 
percent. It is that 1-year extension which expired on July 1 of this 
year. So if the Congress does nothing, the interest rates go back up to 
6.8 percent.
  In the midst of all of this, a lot of ideas have been floating around 
about what to do on student loans and the interest rates. Well, I think 
we have to keep in mind that if we go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, 
that is a doubling. More than 7.2 million college students will be 
required to pay an average of $1,000 more in interest per loan if we 
let it go back to 6.8 percent. Again, that is real money for our 
Nation's students.
  Student loan debt currently exceeds $1 trillion. It is second only to 
mortgage debt in the United States, and it is higher than credit card 
debt. The average student now graduates with more than $26,000 in 
student loan debt. So now is really not the time to make them pay even 
more.
  Now, luckily, we again have a window of time to act before the 
doubling causes any real harm. It doubled on July 1, but we had the 
Fourth of July week, so if we were to again extend the 3.4 percent for 
another year, it would do no harm. It would do no harm to anyone.
  That is why I am urging my colleagues to support S. 1238, the Keep 
Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013. This responsible, fully paid for 
legislation, introduced by Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Hagan, 
Senator Franken, myself, and many others, is a viable solution to 
keeping student loan rates affordable for our middle-class students and 
families struggling to afford college.
  I might add that this bill is supported by 49 student, youth, 
consumer, civil rights, and educational organizations across the 
country. Here is a letter they sent to Leader Reid and Senator 
McConnell dated June 28 to support S. 1238. They said:

       We applaud this bill, which creates a workable solution to 
     maintaining current low rates while Congress seeks to 
     reauthorize the Higher Education Act to reach a comprehensive 
     solution to the student loan crisis that is good for 
     students. We expect a vote on S. 1238 on July 10, 2013, 
     allowing the proposal to take effect in time to protect 
     incoming and returning students this fall.

  That is what is happening tomorrow. Tomorrow we will vote on cloture 
on this bill--cloture, so that then we can get an up-or-down vote on 
whether we are going to extend the 3.4-percent interest rates until 
next July. I will in a moment say why that is so important.
  The letter goes on to say:

       Many of the other proposals being discussed would result in 
     even higher costs to students than if interest rates were 
     simply allowed to double.

  That is, to go to 6.8 percent.

       The bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act put forth by 
     Senators Manchin, Burr, Coburn, Alexander, King and Carper 
     would drive up borrower costs by $1 billion and tie interest 
     rates to the market without a cap to protect students. This 
     proposal would pay down the deficit on the backs of students, 
     trading national debt for student debt. It is unacceptable to 
     use student loans as a vehicle for deficit reduction, 
     especially when the Federal Government is projected to make 
     $51 billion on student loans just this year.

  So that will be the vote tomorrow.
  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, along with the list of the 
organizations supporting the 1-year extension, be printed at this point 
in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                                    June 28, 2013.
     Support S. 1238, the Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 
         2013.

     Senator Harry Reid,
      Hart Senate Office Building,
     Washington, DC.
     Senator Mitch McConnell,
     Russell Senate Office Building,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: We 
     the undersigned student, youth, consumer, civil rights and 
     education organizations urge you to support S. 1238, the Keep 
     Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013, put forth by Senators 
     Jack Reed (D-RI), Kay Hagan (D-NC) and 36 others, which will 
     keep interest rates low for millions of students going to 
     school this fall. If Congress fails to act by July 1, 
     interest rates on federally subsidized Stafford student loans 
     will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, and over 7 
     million students across the country will see the cost of 
     college increase by $1,000 per student, per loan.
       Considering the enormity of the student debt problem and 
     the significant number of students and borrowers impacted, it 
     is clear that we need a comprehensive overhaul of federal 
     student loan policy. However, with just 3 days left until the 
     deadline, it is unlikely that Congress can come to an 
     agreement on comprehensive reform that is better for student 
     loan borrowers than if the rate doubled to 6.8 percent.
       We applaud this bill, which creates a workable solution to 
     maintain current low rates while Congress seeks to 
     reauthorize the Higher Education Act and to reach a 
     comprehensive solution to the student loan crisis that is 
     good for students. We expect a vote on S. 1238 on July 10, 
     2013, allowing the proposal to take effect in time to protect 
     incoming and returning students this fall.
       Many of the other proposals being discussed would result in 
     even higher costs to students than if interest rates were 
     simply allowed to double. The Bipartisan Student Loan 
     Certainty Act put forth by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), 
     Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Coburn (R-OK), Lamar Alexander (R-
     TN), Angus King (I-ME), and Tom Carper (D-DE), would drive up 
     borrower costs by $1 billion and tie interest rates to the 
     market without a cap to protect students. This proposal would 
     pay down the deficit on the backs of students, trading 
     national debt for student debt. It is unacceptable to use 
     student loans as a vehicle for deficit reduction, especially 
     when the federal government is projected to make $51 billion 
     on student loans this year alone.
       We continue to advocate for a long-term, comprehensive 
     solution that ensures affordable rates for students. If 
     Congress cannot find an acceptable long-term solution before 
     students are forced to pay even more this fall, it must act 
     to prevent subsidized Stafford loan rates from doubling.

  Mr. HARKIN. That is really the vote tomorrow. Are we going to keep 
3.4 percent or are we going to allow it to double? That is the essence 
of the vote tomorrow.
  There are a lot of different ideas floating around here about what to 
do and how to do this, but in just about every single case, every one 
of those bills, if you project out over the next couple of years, will 
raise interest rates higher than 6.8 percent. So, again, that is why 
extending it for 1 year is so important.
  The proper place to address this issue is in the reauthorization of 
the Higher Education Act. That expires this year. Our committee will be 
having hearings. We have had some already. We are going to have more 
this fall. We expect to be able to put together a reauthorization bill 
for early next year. This is where it belongs. This is where the 
student loan provision belongs--in the Higher Education Act. Here is 
why. College affordability is more than just what your loans are 
costing you; college affordability also has to do with the tuitions 
being charged by colleges. Why are the tuitions what they are? It also 
has to do with the lack of transparency from one college to another. 
What do courses here cost? What do courses there cost?
  What is built into that cost per course hour, for study hour at this 
college compared to this other college?
  There are a lot of other costs that go into college affordability 
other than just the cost of student loans. So to separate out a student 
loan and treat it as some kind of a separate entity is to kind of 
ignore all of the other things that affect the cost of college 
education. That is why it really needs to be part of a comprehensive 
solution, including Pell grants. Maybe we want to change some of the 
structure of Pell grants. Maybe we want to take a look at exactly what 
it is that we as a society want to do in terms of making college more 
affordable. What kind of interest rate base do we want? Do we want a 
rate based on the 91-day T-bill, which we have had in the past, or, as 
others are proposing now, do we want to go to a 10-year T-note rate? 
What does that mean? That has never been fully fleshed out. That only 
comes out through hearings conducted by the committee. Should it be 
based on the 3-month Treasury note? There are all kinds of different 
ideas floating around, and no one really knows what is the best 
solution.
  I pointed out the necessity for a cap on these loans. I think about 
my own experience when I started college in 1958 when there wasn't such 
a program. But in 1959 and after that we had what was called the 
Eisenhower loan program, the National Defense Education Act. I went to 
a window at Iowa State University and I borrowed money. I borrowed 
money at 2 percent. I recently looked up the interest rate during that 
period of time, the 10-year Treasury note at that time, in 1959, 4.43 
percent, 4.12 percent, 3.88, 3.95--all the years I was in college. Yet 
I borrowed money at 2 percent. So our government, our representatives, 
decided it was worth it for America to subsidize the loans I had, not 
charging the 10-year Treasury note but actually half of that--almost 
half of that. Think about that.
  Not only did our society, our government, say: We want to have a 
fixed rate of 2 percent no matter what the market rate is, all the time 
I was in college--when I was a sophomore, junior, senior--there were no 
interest charges. The interest rate clock did not run. Well, then I 
went in the military for 5 years. During the 5 years I spent in the 
military, there was no interest rate clock. I then got out of the 
military and went to law school. I spent 3 years in law school--no 
interest rate clock. Then after I got out of law school, I had a 1-year 
grace period of no interest rate. So add it up--almost 10 to 12 years 
that I had no interest rate charges. Not until after I was out of law 
school for 1 year did the interest rate clock start to run. Then I had 
to pay back the loans.
  That is what our society, our government, our people decided to do 
for me and for students of our generation in the late fifties and 
sixties and seventies. That is what they decided to do. Now we hear, 
well, no, now we have to go to a market rate. We have to go to a 
Treasury note of 10 years plus something.
  I only talk about this to show the contrast between what our country 
was willing to do for students of my generation and what we are trying 
to do for students of this generation. We are going to sock them with 
higher interest rates. That is why student debt is so high. That is why 
it exceeds credit card debt in this country--because we got away from 
understanding that subsidized rate was an investment in the future of 
our country. It was an investment in getting kids through college and 
not putting a mountain of debt on their heads so that when they got 
out, they could get married and raise families, start to make money and 
buy good consumer items such as cars and homes and all kinds of things 
rather than paying back their debts for the next 10 to 20 years. So we 
have gotten away from that.
  These are the kinds of things we have to kind of think about as we 
reauthorize the Higher Education Act. What is it that we are willing to 
do to invest in this new generation of students in terms of getting 
them an affordable college education?
  In moving forward, I appreciate the efforts of others who have come 
forward with ideas, but there is still a divide here. Here is the 
divide. I think those of us in our caucus, in the Democratic caucus, 
have said we have two key principles we want to uphold: Any deal on 
interest rates should not reduce the deficit on the backs of students. 
We should not trade national debt for student debt. No. 2, we need to 
keep in place an interest rate cap--an interest rate cap--as a key 
consumer protection to shield students from exorbitant rates in the 
future.
  I have the highest respect for our President. I served with him here; 
he was on our committee. I only wish that perhaps they had talked to us 
a little bit before they came out with their proposal, but President 
Obama came out with a proposal on student loans. He was the first 
President--not Democratic, but the first President, Democrat or 
Republican--to propose going from a 91-day T-bill rate to a 10-year 
Treasury note. No other President ever suggested doing that.
  Secondly, no President since 1958 has advocated removing the cap. 
President Obama, in his proposal, proposed removing the cap.
  I believe it is safe to say our caucus has said no, we are not going 
to do that. We are not going to lift this key consumer protection of 
having an interest rate cap. If we are going to go to a 10-year 
Treasury note, then what is it that we do? Do we do it as they did for 
me where they subsidize it below it? Do we add something onto it, and 
how much do we add onto it?
  Again, we have, as I said, two key items. Interest rates should not 
reduce the deficit on the backs of students, and we need to keep in 
place an interest rate cap as a key consumer protection.
  I might point out, this has happened before. We had an interest rate 
cap in the 1990s when we had a variable rate. The cap was at 8.25 
percent. Five times in the 1990s interest rates went above that. The 
cap protected students five times.
  That is why the bill that has been put up by the Republican side, S. 
1241, fails to meet both those principles. Their bill, like the House 
GOP bill and S. 1003, is worse for students over the long term than if 
we let rates double. S. 1241 would raise nearly $1 trillion by charging 
students higher interest rates over 10 years, using net revenue for 
deficit reduction. This bill lacks an interest rate cap, an essential 
protection for students, as I said, that has been in place since 1958.
  According to the CBO projections of the 10-year Treasury note--and 
that is what we have to live with, the CBO projections--under the 
proposal of S. 1241, which I think Senator Alexander

[[Page S5547]]

and others have put forward, graduate students relying on Stafford and 
PLUS loans will see higher interest rates starting in 2016, right here.
  I saw a card about this that said under this bill the graduate 
student loans would be 5.21 percent. That is true here. Then it goes up 
in 2014, 2015, and then in 2016 it goes above the fixed rate of 6.8 
percent and keeps going up to 8.6 percent from then on.
  Students understand this. They looked at this and said: Well, gee, 
here, this is kind of like bait and switch. We get a couple, 3 years 
here where they are lower, and from then on everything is higher for 
us. We don't want this.
  By 2018, on the undergraduate loans, subsidized and unsubsidized 
loans, it is at 7.1 percent. It is even more than the 6.8 percent that 
is in permanent law.
  Again, I repeat, we have always had an interest rate cap. For as long 
as we have had student loans, we have had an interest rate cap. Even 
when we had a variable interest rate from 1992 to 2006, as I pointed 
out, five times we bumped up against that cap, so students were 
protected.
  I have read in S. 1241 the authors stated there is a cap. Does this 
plan have a cap? It says yes.
  There is a consolidation cap which we already have in law, by the 
way. We already have a consolidation cap in law. They keep it. But a 
consolidation cap is not a substitute for an interest rate cap. It is 
apples and oranges. One is a repayment mechanism. That is a 
consolidation cap. The other is a consumer protection called an 
interest rate cap. A consolidation cap is not a real cap.
  Look at it this way. Let'.."

                 HEALTH CARE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2012

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. CHRISTOPHER S. MURPHY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 21, 2012

  Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
value of the medical device industry in my State and our nation as a 
whole. This industry is working on some of the most exciting and 
cutting-edge technologies in the entire health care sector and has 
changed the lives of millions of Americans.
  According to estimates, the medical device industry employs 
approximately 430,000 nationwide. My State is fortunate to have a 
vibrant medical device industry with nearly 8,000 individuals directly 
employed at companies, such as BD and Covidien. These companies also 
support approximately 12,000 more in-direct jobs in my home state. 
Beyond providing quality, high-paying jobs, these businesses are 
responsible corporate citizens who are trying to enhance the 
communities where they are located and the people who live there. For 
example, employees at BD's plant in Canaan, Connecticut--which recently 
celebrated its 50th anniversary--have served as mentors to the 
Housatonic Valley Regional High School and have contributed generously 
to the United Way and other local charities. In line with a growing 
body of evidence on the positive impact bariatric surgery can have on 
diabetics, Covidien has worked with American Diabetes Association to 
fund new research on this potentially life-changing procedure.
  Unfortunately, when the House recently considered the Health Care 
Cost Reduction Act of 2012 (H.R. 436), the majority included an offset 
that, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, would result in 
350,000 fewer Americans receiving health care coverage. As part of the 
Affordable Care Act, the Federal Government is set to provide millions 
of Americans with premium tax credits for the purchase of health 
insurance. This will not only increase rates of coverage but will also 
lead to lower overall health costs since more people are insured. The 
offset that was included in H.R. 436, known as the ``true-up'' 
provision, would have subjected these individuals to large repayment 
amounts if for some reason their income levels increased from the time 
that they were actually receiving coverage to the time they filed their 
taxes the following year. This could come as a result of the individual 
or spouse starting a new job or returning to work after school. While I 
could not support this legislation, I understand the need to reduce the 
medical device industry's burden in paying for health care reform.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe that we can all agree that to maintain our 
position as the world leader in biotechnology, the United States needs 
to foster innovation and growth within our health care industries. I am 
proud that I represent a number of those companies and hope that we 
will find bipartisan solutions to create an environment where they will 
continue to succeed and develop new breakthrough therapies.

                               speech of

                           HON. TIM HUELSKAMP

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 19, 2011

  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Speaker, since the misleadingly-named ``Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act'' was signed into law last year, 
Americans have uncovered more reasons to oppose it. For all the talk of 
``reform'' that accompanied its passage, the law will actually entrench 
the worst aspects of our broken system, driving out-of-control costs 
even higher and taking health care out of the patient's hands and 
giving control to the government.
  Contrary to what they were told, taxpayers have learned that the true 
cost of the law is closer to $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years, and 
will add more than $700 billion to the deficit. Accounting gimmicks 
that included scoring the bill using 10 years of revenue but only 6 
years of new spending and double-counting of Social Security payroll 
taxes, CLASS Act premiums, and Medicare cuts made it seem like this 
program would land the country in the black, but will only result in 
more red ink.
  As a result of this law, employers across America have discovered 
that onerous reporting requirements will force them to file 1099 forms 
for every vendor with which they do $600 worth of business. An 
accountant in my district just told me that he will have to expand his 
staff by 25 percent to accommodate all of his extra paperwork. This is 
not the type of job creation America envisioned.
  Furthermore, when employer costs of insuring employees goes up, 
Americans will lose their private insurance plans, and will be forced 
to go on to government plans. This will also add to the deficit. 
Additionally, businesses and labor unions alike have realized that 
Obamacare is a bad deal, and at least 222 have sought waivers from 
having to comply with the law. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has 
approved special privilege exemptions for dozens of labor unions and 
the half a million union members they cover. And even more troubling is 
that Secretary Sebelius has been tardy in responding to a FOIA inquiry 
regarding the secretive details of these waiver requests.
  And, last but of course not least, patients will soon come to 
discover that this law may not only be dangerous to their pocketbooks, 
but to their health.
  Mandates, dictates, controls, tax hikes, and subsidies will flat-line 
any genuine effort to reform the country's health care system. The 
exploding cost of health care is bankrupting the country, yet the 
government's open-ended commitment to subsidizing health care is the 
very reason costs are skyrocketing.
  Fortunately, instead of waivers for a select few, we have a universal 
remedy: repeal the law for all. I urge my colleagues to heed the calls 
voters made last year during the debate and at the ballot boxes, and 
vote to undo this job-killing legislation.

   CONGRATULATING MARTIN'S POINT HEALTH CARE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. CHELLIE PINGREE

                                of maine

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 12, 2011

  Ms. PINGREE of Maine. Mr. Speaker, today I am thrilled to 
congratulate Martin's Point Health Care Medicare Advantage plans for 
receiving five-star quality ratings from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services.
  Martin's Point Health Care is a not-for-profit health care 
organization that provides primary care services, health plans, and 
wellness services in Maine and other parts of northern New England.
  Under the direction of their president and chief executive officer, 
Dr. David Howes, Martin's Point has established a long tradition of 
providing high quality, efficient, and affordable care to thousands of 
veterans, seniors, and families in Maine.
  Today CMS announced that Martin's Point has received five-star 
ratings for both its Value and Prime Medicare Advantage plans--the 
highest possible rating granted by CMS.
  High quality care is not new to Martin's Point: for the last 3 years, 
Martin's Point has had the highest rated Medicare Advantage plan in 
Maine. But I am particularly proud to say that it is one of only nine 
Medicare Advantage organizations in the entire country to receive the 
CMS five-star designation for 2012.
  The five-star rating system helps Medicare beneficiaries compare 
available plans and make meaningful choices about which plans are right 
for them based on quality of care and customer service. As a five-star 
plan, Martin's Point will be able to assure potential patients that 
they offer the highest quality, patient-centered care. And thanks to 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, this five-star rating 
will make Martin's Point Health Care eligible for quality bonus 
payments from CMS to help bolster their good work and ensure that 
patients in Maine will continue to benefit from their services for 
years to come.
  I want to congratulate Dr. Howes and the entire team of health care 
providers and support staff at Martin's Point for this tremendous 
accomplishment. Their commitment to delivering quality health care and 
service excellence is second to none.
  As we continue to work to shift our health care system to one that 
better values quality outcomes and patient experience, Martin's Point 
will stand as a model for health care organizations across the country, 
and a real asset to the people of Maine.

                          ____________________

                       HEALTH CARE DISCRIMINATION

  (Ms. SPEIER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I'm sick of women getting the short end of 
the stick. On the whole, women earn less than men for the exact same 
jobs. In fact, compared to men, women basically work for free 3.5 
months of the year since we only make 77 cents for every dollar earned 
by a man.
  But here's something that's not free--health care for women. We pay 
$1 billion more a year in health insurance premiums than men. That's 
astounding. And it's not because ``the fairer sex'' is less healthy 
than men. In the individual market, a woman, 40 years old, nonsmoking, 
in Kentucky, actually pays more for her health insurance than a 40-
year-old man who does smoke. Even among 30-year-olds in Chicago, women 
are paying over 30 percent more for health insurance than men of the 
same age. In South Dakota, a 40-year-old woman pays $1,200 more than a 
40-year-old man for the exact same coverage.
  The fact is, women are at the mercy of the vast majority of insurance 
companies which charge us significantly more than men, even with 
maternity coverage excluded.
  Gender Rating in the individual market is wrong and must end.
  And if you want maternity coverage? Forget it.
  How's this for family values?
  For women who do want maternity coverage in the individual market 
it's an uphill battle to find it and an even greater challenge to pay 
for it.
  Maternity coverage is only covered by 6 percent of insurance 
companies unless it is mandated by the state. And the cost can be 
astronomical. Deductibles could be as high as $10,000.
  Some companies offer special maternity coverage riders. In Kansas a 
rider could cost over $1600 a month--well over the cost of a normal 
health insurance premium.
  And some of the riders require long waiting periods before the 
coverage goes into effect.
  Insurance companies call being a woman a pre-existing condition.
  And they get away with charging women more for the same coverage as 
men unless there are laws in place to prevent Gender Rating.

[[Page H1925]]

  Thirteen states, including California, ban gender discrimination in 
insurance coverage. Fortunately, in 2014 when the Affordable Care Act 
goes into effect, the same will be true for the whole country.
  This is a long overdue step for women's equality and a key moment for 
health care.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE CHIPACC BILL CHILDREN'S PROGRAM OF ALL-INCLUSIVE, 
                            COORDINATED CARE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JAMES P. MORAN

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, March 6, 2012

  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about an issue of 
concern to all families, and everyone who has ever known a sick child.
  The Children's Program of All-inclusive, Coordinated Care, ChiPACC, 
program serves the needs of Medicaid-eligible children who suffer from 
potentially terminal illnesses or conditions. The legislation I am 
introducing will make ChiPACC a state option under Medicaid.
  Medicaid-eligible children--like all children who suffer from 
potentially terminal illnesses or conditions--need comprehensive, 
coordinated care. Currently, nearly 30 percent of the children in the 
United States who have life-threatening conditions qualify for 
Medicaid. These children are forced into a system that will only treat 
them on an emergency basis, sending them home to wait until their next 
health emergency.
  Based on the highly effective, collaborative model of care developed 
by Children's Hospice International, CHI, the Children's Program of 
All-inclusive, Coordinated Care provides each enrolled child an 
individualized treatment plan that includes and manages services from 
providers across the health care spectrum. ChiPACC's services will 
improve upon the often inconsistent care that is currently available to 
seriously ill children under Medicaid, doing so at a savings to 
taxpayers.
  With appropriate comprehensive and coordinated services under 
ChiPACC, many emergency episodes can be avoided or anticipated and 
managed, such that children receive appropriate care in their homes 
instead of in hospitals, and so that even when they require critical 
care they can enter the hospital through the front door instead of the 
emergency room, significantly reducing health care costs.
  Under the former Medicaid model, individuals could receive only 
``hospice'' services and only after their doctors give them a prognosis 
of six months to live. Children, however, are much more likely than 
adults to go in and out of terminal phases multiple times. No family 
should be forced to give up curative care for their child in order to 
receive services that are predicated on accepting that their child has 
no more than 6 months to live. I am very pleased that the Affordable 
Care Act amended this policy to allow curative care for Medicaid 
eligible children in hospice. But ChiPACC goes beyond curative care and 
combines medical and support services currently available in Medicaid 
with counseling, respite, and other care that have previously only been 
available as hospice services.
  Please join me in sponsoring this very important legislation.

                          ____________________

[Pages S12980-S12981]
                           HEALTH CARE REFORM

  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about health 
care and our children and the health care reform, the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, as relates to our children.
  The chart on my left makes a couple of fundamental points.
  For children, health care reform must follow one simple principle, 
and I also say it is only four words: No child worse off. When I say 
``no child,'' of course I am speaking of children who do not often have 
a voice. Obviously, if they are children from a family that is very 
wealthy, I think they will be just fine no matter what happens here. 
But children who are poor and children who experience and have to live 
with special needs are the ones I am talking about when I say ``no 
child worse off.''
  I filed many weeks ago--actually, months ago now--a joint resolution, 
No. 170. I was joined in that resolution by Senator Dodd, Senator 
Rockefeller, Senator Brown, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Sanders. We 
filed that resolution just to make this point with a couple more words 
than ``no child worse off,'' but that was the fundamental point to 
guide us through this process because sometimes in a debate on 
something that is this significant, and parts of it are complicated to 
be enacted into law--it is a challenge to pass health care reform. I 
think we will. I think we must. But we do need guiding principles, and 
I believe one of these should be ``no child worse off'' for special 
needs children.
  A lot of the child advocates across America have told us, for many 
years, something so simple but something very meaningful in terms of 
providing further guidance for this debate. Children are not small 
adults. That does not sound so profound, but it really matters when it 
comes to health care. We can't just say: If you have a health care plan 
for adults, it will work for kids, do not worry about it. 
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
  If we do not do the right thing, we could lose our way on that basic 
principle. We have to get it right, and we have to give poor and 
special needs children a voice in this debate. I do not think there is 
any question that Senators on this side of the aisle are guided by that 
basic principle.
  I want to next turn to the bill, the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, and walk through some of the provisions. There are 
many good provisions in the bill for children, but I want to walk 
through a couple.
  How does it help children? That is a fundamental question. You cannot 
escape the basic implications of that. First, the bill eliminates 
preexisting condition exclusions. That is in the first couple pages of 
the bill. Obviously, it has an enormously positive impact for adults. 
We have heard story after story of literally millions of Americans 
denied coverage year after year because of the problem of preexisting 
conditions. It has special meaning when it comes to children.
  No. 2, the bill ensures that benefits packages include oral and 
vision care. We know what that means for children, and in particular we 
are thinking about the horrific, tragic, and preventable death recently 
of Deamonte Driver of Maryland, a young boy who lost his life because 
his family did not have the coverage for an infected tooth--an infected 
tooth, not something that is complicated to deal with. His family 
couldn't afford the care. A child in America died from an infected 
tooth that would have cost $80 to treat.

  So when we talk about insuring benefit packages that include oral and 
vision care, that doesn't say it too well until you connect it to the 
life and the death--the tragic death--of a young child not too far from 
Washington, DC.
  Thirdly, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will mandate 
prevention and screenings for children. This is so important. We know 
our poorest children, who have the benefit of being covered by 
Medicaid, get these kinds of services so we can prevent a child from 
getting sicker or prevent a disease or a condition or a problem from 
becoming that much worse for that child.
  As I said before, children are not small adults, so we have to make 
sure we have strategies and procedures in place that deal with the 
special needs and the special challenges that children face in our 
health care system.
  Finally, the act has increasing access to immunizations. I don't 
think I have to explain to any American how important immunizations 
are. The Centers for Disease Control will provide grants to improve 
immunizations for children, adolescents, and adults.
  Let me move to the third chart. The third chart outlines some other 
provisions for children. Here are three more ways the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act helps children, among many others. 
It creates pediatric medical homes. People may say: What is a medical 
home? What does that mean? Well, I need simplicity just like anyone 
does. This is my best summary of a medical home.
  A medical home obviously isn't a place. It is treating people in the 
way they ought to be treated in our health care system. The ideal--and 
I think this bill gets us very close to meeting this goal--is that 
every American should have a primary care physician and then be 
surrounded by the expertise of our health care system. Children 
especially need that kind of help. So we want to make sure every child 
not only has a primary care physician--in this case a pediatrician--but 
also has access to all of the expertise that pediatricians and our 
system can give them access to.
  Next, the act strengthens the pediatric workforce. We can't just say 
we want children to have access to pediatric care. We have to make sure 
we have the workforce in America to provide that kind of care.
  Thirdly, the act expands drug discounts to children's hospitals. 
Before this act, before the act that we are debating, children's 
hospitals did not have access to a program that provides discounts on 
the drugs they need for

[[Page S12981]]

sick children. Now children will benefit from the discounted prices 
that result from the passage of this act. This is vitally important.
  Let me go to one more chart.
  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How much time do I have 
remaining?
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes.
  Mr. CASEY. Two minutes. I will just do one chart and then we will 
move quickly.
  This chart makes a very fundamental point. At a time in our history 
when over the course of a year the national poverty rate went up by 
800,000, and the number of people without insurance is going up--and in 
the midst of a recession, you would understand and expect that--the one 
thing we don't focus on is that because of the effectiveness of the 
Children's Health Insurance Program, there is one number on this chart 
that is going down--and we hope it keeps going down--and that is the 
number of uninsured children.
  It is interesting that on this chart between 2007-2008, as the child 
poverty rate went up by 800,000 children, the number of children 
without insurance is down by that same number--800,000. It shows the 
Children's Health Insurance Program is working, even in the midst of a 
recession. So I have an amendment that strengthens the Children's 
Health Insurance Program in the bill.
  I know I am out of time, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have gone 
over the original allocation of time, and Senator McCain is coming to 
the floor. We will, of course, offer to the minority side whatever 
extra time we will use so that there will be a like amount available to 
them, and I will make every effort to shorten my remarks.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has not exceeded its 
time. There is 12 minutes remaining on the clock.
  Mr. DURBIN. Sorry, I was misinformed. But whatever we promised the 
minority side, they will receive like treatment on whatever time we 
use.

                             NO CO-PAY DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, August 1, 2012

  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate No 
Co-Pay Day.
  Today marks a victory for women's health care. Some 47 million women 
will now be able to get preventative services that couldn't before this 
rule went into effect.
  Any new insurance policies sold to individuals or employers must 
cover contraception without a co-pay as part of a larger package of 
mandatory co-pay-free women's preventive care benefits. Insurance plans 
that have already been purchased will have to start offering no-co-pay 
contraception when they renew.
  Before the Affordable Care Act, some insurance companies did not 
cover preventative services for women under their health care plans, 
and others required deductibles or co-pays for the care they needed.
  That changes today--all health insurance policies are required to 
cover new preventative care without charging women any co-pays or 
deductibles. Some of the new preventative services now available with 
no co-pay include annual visits, FDA-approved contraceptives, domestic 
violence screenings and counseling, breastfeeding support, HPV DNA 
testing for women 30 or older, HIV and sexually transmitted infections 
screenings, and gestational diabetes screenings that help protect 
pregnant women from one of the most serious pregnancy-related diseases.
  Too often, women put their families' health care before their own, 
especially when it comes to preventative care.
  Thanks to this new benefit in the Affordable Care Act, women can get 
the regular checkups and screenings that are so important to staying 
healthy without having to worry about how much it will affect the 
family budget.
  Today's announcement is just one more part of the overall 
implementation plan for improving our nation's health care system.
  The Affordable Care Act will provide greater access to affordable 
health care for millions of women and families who do not have coverage 
now, while also lowering health care costs, creating jobs, 
strengthening the middle class, and reducing the deficit.

   REPEALING MANDATORY FUNDING FOR SCHOOL HEALTH CENTER CONSTRUCTION

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. EARL BLUMENAUER

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 3, 2011

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1214) to 
     repeal mandatory funding for school-based health center 
     construction:

  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I voted against H.R. 1214, which would 
repeal the grants for the construction and expansion of school-based 
health centers. The Affordable Care Act included funding to expand 
school-based health programs across America so that we can provide 
better care for our children. Students who are healthy are ready to 
learn.
  School-based health centers provide our children with quality, 
comprehensive care that includes mental health services, social 
services and preventative care. A survey conducted by the National 
Assembly on School-Based Health Care found that when properly funded, 
school-based health centers help fill the gap in access to health 
services, especially for rural and underserved populations.
  These centers are accountable to their communities through an 
advisory board made up of local representatives, family organizations 
and parents. These programs bring health care to our kids and provide 
service without concern for whether or not they can afford it.
  In my state of Oregon, we are part of the School Mental Health 
Capacity Building Partnership to examine and improve mental health 
programs to be used in school-based health centers. As an early-adopter 
state for these centers, Oregon was selected to be one of four states 
to lead the way on this research. This important work, focused on 
tailoring mental health care to better meet our children and youths 
needs, relies on the school-based health center funding and will be 
jeopardized by this legislation.
  H.R. 1214 would prevent us from investing in our children and driving 
down future health care costs. At the start of this Congress, the only 
alternative the Republicans offered to the Affordable Care Act was a 
repeal-and-do-not-replace approach that is irresponsible at best.
  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but Congress should be 
focused on implementing the Act, and refining--not repealing--its 
provisions. I oppose this legislation.

                  NATIONAL HOME CARE AND HOSPICE MONTH

  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our country strives to provide exceptional 
support for the sick, elderly and terminally ill in home and hospice 
settings. These vulnerable individuals, as well as their family 
caregivers, are indebted to the many professionals and volunteers who 
have made it their life's work to serve those in greatest need. Nearly 
83,000 hospice professionals, 46,000 hospice volunteers and 1 million 
home health providers, nationally, contribute significantly to our 
health care system through their compassion and commitment.
  Hospice care provides humane and comforting support for over 744,000 
terminally ill patients and their families each year. These services 
include pain control, palliative medical care and social, emotional and 
spiritual services.

[[Page S7953]]

Hospice supports the basic human needs for feeling comfortable, in a 
familiar environment, surrounded by loving caregivers and family during 
the later stages of life. Hospice care is an effective model for the 
interaction of interdisciplinary teams of health professionals, family 
members and volunteers in providing care for those needing care in our 
communities.
  The movement to provide health care and supportive services in the 
home environment has evolved rapidly over the past few decades. Home 
care services typically bring the expertise and compassion of providers 
in numerous disciplines into the setting where most sick patients 
prefer to reside--the home. More than 11 million Americans benefit each 
year from this approach.
  We have made great strides in advancing care for all Americans 
through the recently enacted Affordable Care Act. A key provision in 
this effort is the establishment of a Medicare hospice concurrent care 
demonstration program, which would allow patients who are eligible for 
hospice care to also receive all other Medicare covered services during 
the same period of time. Following establishment of this program, I am 
hopeful that this country will move in a direction where individuals 
and families do not have to make the difficult choice between hospice 
and curative care in the Medicare Program.
  On behalf of Oregon home health and hospice providers celebrating 
November as home care and hospice month, I thank the thousands of 
everyday heroes such as home health nurses, therapists, and aides, who 
work tirelessly to provide professional health and palliative care and 
support to millions of Americans in need of quality health services. 
Their efforts allow families to stay together, and provide greater 
comfort and dignity to those in our communities.

               IN COMMEMORATION OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. LAURA RICHARDSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, March 1, 2012

  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, this March as we celebrate Women's 
History Month, I would like to take a moment to recognize all the great 
female leaders of our past and present. Throughout history women have 
persevered in the face of great opposition and successfully broken 
barriers in the arts, education, government and corporate America.
  This year's theme focuses on women's education and empowerment. It is 
important to note that the equal opportunity for women to learn 
alongside men is owed much to Title IX of the Education Codes of the 
Higher Education Act Amendments which passed in 1972 and was enacted in 
1977. This legislation prohibited gender discrimination by federally 
funded institutions, and allowed women to fully

[[Page E305]]

participate in all aspects of education effectively transforming the 
educational landscape of the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, women have taken great strides throughout the years to 
gain equal treatment. Unfortunately, in matters involving healthcare, 
women still face challenges. Very recently, women faced attacks by the 
House Republican majority regarding access to birth control. More 
disconcerting, these attacks escalated beyond misguided attempts to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act and deny women access to contraceptives, 
to restricting women's choices in the area of reproductive health 
altogether. Medical decisions about a woman's health must be left to 
the discretion of the patient and her doctor, not employers or the 
government.
  This is why I am proud to support President Obama's Affordable Care 
Act which will make a positive impact on women's access to health care 
and greatly decrease the number of women who are uninsured or 
``underinsured.'' Studies have shown that women who have health 
insurance don't necessarily receive certain types of medical care 
because either the services they need are not covered by their 
policies, or they cannot afford the high deductibles or co-payments. 
The Affordable Care Act changes this unfortunate reality by assisting 
women in gaining access to basic preventive health care in order to 
prevent life-threatening diseases in the future.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here in celebration of women and 
their immeasurable contributions to this great Nation. As we pay 
tribute to the generations of women whose commitment to progress have 
proved invaluable to society, let us also renew our commitment to 
support women and the equal treatment of all in society, regardless of 
gender, race, or religion.

                          ____________________

           By Mr. CANTOR:
       H.R. 6079.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 
     the Supreme Court rejected the constitutional basis offered 
     by proponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
     Act, the interstate commerce clause found in Article I, 
     Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution. Having eliminated 
     the requirement that all Americans buy insurance, the Supreme 
     Court recast the law's penalty for not buying insurance as a 
     tax, which Americans would pay in lieu of purchasing 
     insurance, and five Justices upheld this tax under the taxing 
     power of Congress, found in Article I, Section 8, Clause 1. 
     With the individual requirement to buy insurance having been 
     found unconstitutional, and, with the compulsory nature of 
     that requirement being central to the funding mechanism 
     contemplated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
     Act, Congress hereby repeals the Act in its entirety. 
     Furthermore, Congress did not intend and does not now intend 
     to invoke its taxing power in relation to the individual 
     requirement to buy insurance.
       The Congress, the Executive, and the Judiciary are 
     obligated to act according to the principle of coordinate 
     branch construction based on their respective obligations to 
     ensure that all their actions are constitutional. This is the 
     clear meaning of the Vesting Clauses of Articles I, II, and 
     III along with the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, as well as 
     of the Oath of Office that each constitutional officer of the 
     Federal government must take pursuant to Article VI. James 
     Madison made this clear in 1834 stating, ``As the 
     Legislative, Executive, and Judicial departments of the 
     United States are co-ordinate, and each equally bound to 
     support the Constitution, it follows that each must in the 
     exercise of its functions be guided by the text of the 
     Constitution according to its own interpretation of it.''
       The ``Repeal of Obamacare Act'' repeals the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act and title I and subtitle B 
     of title II of the Health Care and Education Affordability 
     Reconciliation Act of 2010, which included several specific 
     provisions that extend beyond the enumerated powers granted 
     to Congress by the Constitution, including, in particular, 
     the Commerce, Taxing, and the Spending Clauses of Article I, 
     Section 8, as well as the Necessary and Proper Clauses 
     contained therein, and that otherwise improperly extend 
     authority to Federal agencies in a manner inconsistent with 
     the Vesting Clause of Article I, Section 1.
       The general repeal of this legislation is consistent with 
     the powers that are reserved to the States and to the people 
     as expressed in Amendment X to the United States 
     Constitution.

                 IN SUPPORT OF NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. LAURA RICHARDSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 6, 2012

  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of National 
Adoption Month because family is a fundamental American value. Family 
makes us who we are. Family provides us support and it provides us with 
a strong sense of belonging.
  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, there are thousands of children across 
the United States who are alone and do not know family. According to 
the most recent Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System 
(AFCARS) report which provides government statistics for FY 2011, there 
are 104,000 children and youth currently in foster care who are waiting 
for permanent families.
  Mr. Speaker, raising awareness about adoption has been the focus of 
politicians for many decades. In 1976, Governor Michael Dukakis of 
Massachusetts announced an Adoption Week to promote awareness of the 
need for adoptive families for children in foster care. In 1984, 
President Reagan proclaimed the first National Adoption Week. Seventeen 
years ago, in 1995, President Bill Clinton expanded the awareness week 
to the entire month of November.
  During National Adoption Month, we are granted the opportunity to 
continue our efforts to promote and raise awareness about adoption.
  Today, we are making every effort to use the Internet and social 
media in adoption recruitment.
  Mr. Speaker, this month, we place particular attention on the youth 
and children looking for families and on the families looking to adopt. 
Our goal for the month of November is to put special emphasis on 
uniting youth and adoptive parents as happy, permanent families.
  I am a proud supporter of the Affordable Care Act which improved 
adoption credit. The Affordable Care Act raised the maximum adoption 
credit to $13,360 per child, up from $13,170 in 2010 and $12,150 in 
2009. The adoption tax credit was refundable for tax year 2011, meaning 
that eligible taxpayers receive it even if they owe no tax for that 
year. In general, the credit is based on the reasonable and necessary 
expenses related to a legal adoption, including adoption fees, court 
costs, attorney's fees and travel expenses.
  I am also a proud member of the adoption caucus.
  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of 
National Adoption Month. I also urge you to join me in supporting the 
Affordable Care Act and in becoming a member of the adoption caucus.

[Pages H6455-H6456]
                         IMPROVING HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, this body has attempted to repeal the 
health care law 41 times. The act's repeal or delay is being used as 
leverage in the current budget fight, but I just want to take a few 
minutes to remind people why we passed the health reform law in the 
first place.
  Let's remember the situation before ObamaCare became law. Clearly the 
status quo was not sustainable. The number one cause of personal 
bankruptcy in the United States was medical costs, and 60 percent of 
those who filed for bankruptcy had insurance. Forty-seven million 
Americans were without health care. Premiums were rising three times 
faster than wages, eating up more of our paychecks and bottom lines.
  The average family was already paying a hidden health care tax of 
over $1,000 annually in premiums as a direct result of subsidizing the 
cost of the uninsured. Small businesses were paying 18 percent more 
than larger employers for health insurance. People with preexisting 
conditions were denied coverage or thrown off their coverage when they 
got sick and needed it most. Senior citizens fell into the doughnut 
hole and had to pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket for their 
prescriptions.
  We cannot go back. We cannot repeal this essential law. We must move 
forward together and fix the very real problems with health care 
reform; but before we do that, we have to stop spreading falsehoods and 
set the record straight about what is in the law and what is not.
  Myth number one: Members of Congress and their staffs are somehow 
exempt from the law. Not only are Members and their staff not exempt 
from the law, but they are actually subject to extra requirements. 
Insurance marketplaces that Members and staff must now join were 
actually designed for people who currently do not have insurance or get 
it on the individual market. People who already have insurance through 
their employers, like Members and their staff, don't need to get 
insurance through the marketplace because they already have coverage. 
Still, due to a messaging amendment in the ACA, Members and their staff 
were required to get their insurance through the marketplace and they 
will.
  Myth number two: the Affordable Care Act is a job killer. First of 
all, 97 percent of small employers are exempt from the requirements to 
provide insurance. Second, most large employers who are required to 
provide coverage already do so. Aside from reporting requirements, the 
ACA will only require about 1 percent of businesses to do anything 
differently. Some on the other side of this aisle often cite a 
Congressional Budget Office report which said the ACA would lead to a 
reduction in the amount of labor in the economy by one-half of one 
percent. What the critics failed to add is that the same report noted 
that the small reduction in labor would come primarily from people 
choosing to work less.
  There are legitimate concerns from small restaurants and hospitality 
entities that are worried about affording affordable coverage for their 
part-time employees. These concerns are real and should be addressed; 
but exaggerating claims that the ACA is a job killer and trying to 
repeal or defund it rather than remedy it does nothing to help those 
businesses with real concerns.
  Myth number three: the Affordable Care Act is driving up premiums. 
Some historical context is important here. Premiums grew 119 percent 
between 1999 and the year 2008. Over the last 2 years, premiums have 
only increased an average of 4 percent. On the individual level, 
because insurance companies can no longer charge older individuals 
significantly more than younger folks, this will shift some costs to 
younger Americans. However, the insurance subsidies provided by the law 
will significantly blunt those potential cost increases. Those who are 
uninsured with preexisting conditions who previously could not get 
coverage will likely pay less. Finally, those with employer-provided 
coverage, the majority of Americans, will see little change.
  We need to do more to hold down the cost of health care; but rather 
than talking about real cost reduction reforms, opponents of the law 
are simply trying to repeal it--41 times. This Nation's health care 
system faces real

[[Page H6456]]

challenges, and we need real solutions. If critics of the law spent as 
much energy on developing legitimate solutions as they do on 
perpetuating falsehoods about the ACA, we might make some progress. 
Let's stop the fear-mongering, come together and have a real 
conversation about improving our health care system.

[Pages S467-S481]
 HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 294.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 294, S. 1926, a bill to 
     delay the implementation of certain provisions of the 
     Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and to 
     reform the National Association of Registered Agents and 
     Brokers, and for other purposes.


                                Schedule

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at 5:30 p.m. there will be a rollcall vote 
on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the flood 
insurance bill.


                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 1950

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told that S. 1950 is at the desk and 
due for a second reading.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by 
title for the second time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1950) to improve the provision of medical 
     services and benefits to veterans, and for other purposes.

  Mr. REID. I would object to any further proceedings with respect to 
this bill at this time.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV.


                            Flood Insurance

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I announced earlier, today the Senate 
will vote at 5:30 to advance legislation which will protect millions of 
homeowners and small businesses from drastic increases in flood 
insurance premiums. This bipartisan measure will save many homeowners 
thousands of dollars a year and protect America's recovering housing 
market.
  Since higher premiums would kick in whenever a home is sold, still 
struggling housing markets across the country could stumble if Congress 
allows flood insurance rates to skyrocket. That will happen if we don't 
move this legislation.
  The bill before the Senate will preserve current rates until the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency submits a plan to keep premiums 
reasonable and provide stability to home and business owners.
  I wish to thank Senators Menendez and Landrieu, as well as Senator 
Isakson, for their leadership on this issue. Their bill will cut 
through the red tape and give consumers better, cheaper options when 
they shop for insurance.
  So I hope the Senate can wrap up work quickly on this measure. We 
have tried for weeks to get agreement to move forward on it, but we are 
never quite there. Always there are requests to give a little more 
time. That time has run out. Homeowners deserve certainty, and the 
Senate faces a substantial workload over the next 3 weeks.
  Tomorrow, President Obama will address Congress and the Nation in his 
annual State of the Union address. I, like the American people, look 
forward to hearing the President's vision to create an economy in which 
the middle class grows and prospers, because every individual should 
have a fair shot at success.
  The Senate must also consider a number of critical national security 
and judicial nominations in the coming weeks. With the help of my 
Republican colleagues, we could process these nominations swiftly and 
painlessly--without late night or weekend votes.

[[Page S468]]

As always, it will depend upon the level of cooperation we receive from 
the Republicans.
  This work period the Senate will also consider a farm bill conference 
report. This legislation is a compromise that was reached thanks to the 
leadership of Chairwoman Stabenow, and it will reduce the deficit and 
cut waste and fraud, all while protecting hungry children and families.
  The Senate will also debate legislation to effectively prevent and 
punish sexual assault in the Nation's Armed Forces, and we have 
competing views of this with Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand.
  Democrats will continue our fight to restore benefits to 1.6 million 
Americans looking for work during difficult economic times. In the last 
2 weeks since Republicans filibustered a bill to restore this important 
lifeline, an additional 150,000 Americans have lost their emergency 
unemployment benefits. For many families already suffering through hard 
times, the loss of $300 a week has meant going without food, turning 
down the heat on freezing days or staring down homelessness.
  One Nevada woman--a Vietnam veteran in her sixties who has worked all 
her life and raised a family--said she is afraid she will end up on the 
streets if Washington doesn't restore her emergency benefits. This is 
what she wrote to me:

       It is not that I don't want to work. It is that I am unable 
     to procure job . . . I do feel that it might be my age, but I 
     am more energetic than some young people I know. Please 
     continue to [work to] get this passed, as I am fearful that I 
     will end up homeless.

  Her situation is not unique. Nationwide, thousands upon thousands of 
veterans looking for work have been kicked off unemployment. In Nevada, 
where unemployment is still almost 9 percent, 21,000 people struggling 
to find jobs have been cut off from these benefits. In fact, 
unemployment actually ticked up slightly in Las Vegas last month. As 
long as there are three job seekers for every available position, we 
owe it to Americans to lend a helping hand during this emergency.


                       Reservation of Leader Time

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1926.
  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be 
permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes as if in morning business.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.


                          Margaret Chase Smith

  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 50 years ago today, on January 27, 1964, 
Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine announced her candidacy for 
President of the United States. The following July, at the Republican 
National Convention in San Francisco, the great lady from Maine became 
the first woman in history to ever have her name entered into 
nomination by a major party for our Nation's highest office. I rise to 
commemorate this remarkable leader and this significant milestone in 
our history.
  At the time of her announcement, Senator Smith was in her 24th year 
in Congress and was an established groundbreaker. She was the first 
woman elected to both the House and the Senate and the first to serve 
on the Armed Services Committee. She was the woman who gave other women 
the opportunity to pursue careers in the military. Due to her early and 
energetic support for the space program, she has been called the woman 
who put a man on the Moon.
  Her courageous ``Declaration of Conscience'' delivered in the Senate 
on June 1, 1950, turned the tide against McCarthyism and reminded all 
Americans of our Nation's core values of free expression and 
independent thought.
  Senator Smith made her Presidential announcement in a speech at the 
Women's National Press Club in Washington. Yes, Mr. President, there 
was a separate press club for women in those days. It was an important 
address in which she described both the progress that America had made 
against bigotry, prejudice, extremism, and hatred as well as the 
challenges that remained, but Margaret Chase Smith saved the best for 
last. After telling her audience of the flood of letters she had been 
receiving from all over the country urging her to run for President, 
Senator Smith described the reasons offered by her supporters, such as 
she had more experience at the national level than any of the other 
confirmed candidates, she had the stature that could break the barrier 
against women being seriously considered for President, she would 
provide a moderate, middle-of-the-road option in an election that was 
shaping up as one between a very conservative and very liberal 
philosophy.
  Then she described the reasons she should not run: The widespread 
contention that the Presidency was a man's job, her lack of financial 
resources, and a professional political organization, and the fact that 
the odds were stacked heavily against her. Senator Smith said she found 
the reasons offered against running far more compelling than those in 
favor. So imagine the surprise of her audience when she said that 
because of those very reasons, she had decided to enter the New 
Hampshire primary.
  Senator Smith's campaign was off and running, and what a campaign it 
was. Senator Smith accepted no money from anyone. All contributions--
whether they were large or small--were returned to sender. She took to 
the campaign trail only when the Senate was not in session in order to 
preserve her perfect record of never missing a rollcall vote and to 
keep the pledge of dedicated service she had made to the people of 
Maine. Her campaign motto was: ``There is nothing more effective than a 
handshake and a little conversation.''
  As a consequence of her self-imposed financial and time restraints, 
Senator Smith did not win a primary. But in the one primary where she 
was able to campaign somewhat extensively--the State of Illinois for 
all of two weekends and a total expenditure of $85--she finished a 
strong second in a field of six. She lost only to the eventual nominee, 
Barry Goldwater. With 25 percent of the vote, she came in far ahead of 
such well-known candidates as Richard Nixon, Nelson Rockefeller, and 
Henry Cabot Lodge. It is intriguing to think what she might have done 
with a more traditional campaign.
  At the Republican National Convention in San Francisco that year, 
Senator Smith's name was entered into nomination by Senator George 
Aiken of Vermont. He told the delegates that Senator Smith's integrity, 
ability, common sense, and courage made her ``the best qualified person 
you ever voted for.'' On the first ballot, 27 delegates did vote for 
Margaret Chase Smith from the great State of Maine.
  Unlike the other candidates, Senator Smith did not release her 
delegates to the landslide victor, Senator Goldwater. That was not done 
out of spite. Indeed, she campaigned earnestly for him in the general 
election. It was done because she wanted to demonstrate--she wanted the 
historical record to show that a woman had been given serious 
consideration for the Presidency of this country.
  Many words have been spoken over many years in attempts to describe 
the character of Senator Margaret Chase Smith. Perhaps the best were 
offered by the candidate herself on that campaign trail a half century 
ago. She said:

       I have few illusions and no money, but I'm staying for the 
     finish. When people keep telling you, you can't do a thing, 
     you kind of like to try.

  On this milestone anniversary, I am honored to celebrate an 
extraordinary woman from Maine who tried and failed in one endeavor but 
in doing so inspired generations of Americans with her strength and 
determination and demonstrated, as she once said, that a woman's place 
is ``everywhere.''
  Today, the Senate has a record 20 women Senators. In a sense each of 
us owes a debt to Senator Margaret Chase Smith, but none more so than 
I. You

see, I first met Senator Smith when I was a high school senior from 
Caribou, ME. I was selected as one of two students to come to 
Washington as part of the Senate Youth Program sponsored by the William 
Randolph Hearst Foundation, a program that still exists today. I 
remember how excited I was to see Senator Smith and her graciousness in 
inviting me into her office and spending nearly 2 hours with me.
  As the Presiding Officer can appreciate, for any of us to spend 2 
hours with anyone is remarkable nowadays, but Margaret Chase Smith 
carved out that time to talk with me. Recently her library sent me 
copies of her appointment book for that day so I could see that my 
appointment with her was listed and preserved for all time.
  She talked to me not about what it was like being the only woman in 
the Senate, she talked to me instead about her service on the Armed 
Services Committee, about what we could do to create more jobs in this 
country and, most of all, about her famous ``Declaration of 
Conscience'' in which she stood up against the smear campaign and the 
excesses of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Through that speech she taught us 
all to stand tall for what we believe in and to speak out against 
injustice and bigotry.
  I remember when I left her office I was so thrilled and inspired. I 
remember thinking women could do anything. This was back in 1971, and 
although I came from a family with wonderful role models in both my 
mother and my father, who were so active in their community and in 
their State, there were a lot of other messages about that time that 
raised doubts in the minds of growing girls about whether we could, in 
fact, be whatever we wanted to be. So that message that I learned from 
Margaret Chase Smith was so important in shaping who I am today.
  Although I did not know it at the time at all, that meeting with 
Margaret Chase Smith shortly after I had turned 18 as a high school 
senior taught me I could achieve my dream, and in many ways it was the 
first step on a journey that led me to run for her seat in the Senate 
25 years later.
  Today I am so proud that the desk at which I stand--the desk that I 
use and is assigned to me on the Senate floor--once belonged to the 
legendary Senator from Maine Margaret Chase Smith. What a wonderful 
role model she was to me the entire time I was growing up when she was 
representing the State of Maine with such integrity, skill, and 
courage. I feel so fortunate to hold her seat in the Senate.

  So today it gives me great pride as well as great pleasure to inform 
my colleagues that this is the 50th anniversary of the day that Senator 
Margaret Chase Smith of Maine became the first woman in history to 
announce her candidacy for President of the United States and later 
that year to be the first woman to have her name placed in nomination 
by a major political party. Let us celebrate this day as we also 
celebrate the presence of a record number of women in the Senate. I 
believe that would have made Senator Smith very proud.
  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.


                           immigration reform

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the immigration issue the country is 
wrestling with is broad and deep and has huge ramifications in a host 
of areas. But one area that has just been ignored systematically, it 
seems to me--at least to a degree that is unacceptable--is the impact a 
massive increase in immigration to America will have on the already 
declining wages and job prospects of Americans who are hurting 
today. That is just a fact that needs to be discussed. We need to be 
honest about it.

  Prime Minister David Cameron in the United Kingdom has announced 
major reductions in immigration and said there may be more. He said we 
cannot expect that foreign workers would take jobs we need to be 
training Britons to do. How simple and valuable a concept is that?
  So we are talking about legislation that can shift the power, wealth 
from working people to businesspeople, the corporations, because it 
will shift, if not done properly--and we believe in immigration. We are 
not opposed to immigration. It just needs to be done at the level and 
in the proper way so our workers are not so adversely impacted, as 
would occur if the Senate bill were to become law. Thank goodness the 
House is saying they are not going to pass that bill.
  President Obama is preparing to deliver a State of the Union Address 
tomorrow night in which he will address the continued financial 
collapse of the American middle class, much of which has occurred on 
his watch. However, it did start before he took office.
  Since 2000, the average wage of working Americans has declined. As 
adjusted for inflation, it is negative. In the last 2 or 3 years--since 
the recession is supposed to be over and has been announced is over--
that decline has accelerated. Professor Borjas and others have tagged a 
lot of that result as occurring because of a substantial increase in 
immigration that has been occurring in America. If the President wishes 
to demonstrate a sincere concern for struggling workers, then he must 
recognize the negative impact his immigration policies are having on 
wage earners throughout the country right now.
  According to Harvard Professor Borjas, the Nation's leading expert on 
immigration and an economist--himself an immigrant from Cuba as a young 
man--Professor Borjas says every dollar of increased profit for 
companies that use immigrant labor is offset by a dollar in lost wages 
for the Americans competing with that immigrant labor. Think about 
that.
  In fact, he estimates that businesses lobbying for this bill will 
benefit on an order of $400 billion. They and their political activist 
allies lobbying for this bill, they definitely receive a financial 
benefit. He estimates, based on rigorous analysis that virtually every 
dollar of that will come from reduced wages of American workers.
  That is the way, colleagues, the free enterprise system works. If we 
have more cotton in America, the price of cotton goes down. If we bring 
in more labor than we have had before, the price of labor comes down. 
That is just the way it works. We have not eliminated the law of supply 
and demand. The law of supply and demand dictates that an increased 
supply of workers will result in a reduced cost of hiring workers.
  The President's push for higher Federal wage controls and extended 
unemployment jobless benefits is effectively an admission that his 
policies have cut wages and reduced the ability of Americans to get 
jobs.
  But these measures he is proposing are treating the symptoms. Why are 
not wages going up as they have throughout most of the history of our 
country, naturally through supply and demand? Could it be that we have 
had, as Professor Borjas said, for the last 30 years an incredible 
increase in the flow of foreign workers who are competing for these 
jobs every single year?
  One cannot return to full employment and rising wages for workers at 
all skill levels without tightening the labor market. We have a loose 
labor market. We have a surplus of people looking for jobs.
  Gene Sperling, the President's top adviser on the economy, said just 
a few weeks ago that we have three workers applying for each one job 
that exists in America. Why in the world then would we want to bring in 
and allow businesses to demand increased numbers of low-skilled 
workers?
  The President's plan will provide companies an incentive to hire even 
fewer American workers, and they will be less likely to hire a person 
who has been unemployed for a long time--the long-term unemployed.
  The United States has already formally admitted more immigrants, 
largely lesser skilled, in the last 10 years than any prior 10-year 
period in America's history. So the question every reporter, pundit, 
and lawmaker should ask is this: How does the President think it will 
help Americans trying to climb into the middle class to pass an 
immigration plan that would

[[Page S470]]

double the number of immigrant workers competing against them for jobs 
and wages?
  The single largest category in our budget right now is welfare and 
poverty support programs helping people who have lower incomes. 
Including State contributions, my Budget Committee staff has discovered 
we spend more than a $1 trillion on Federal means-tested support 
programs each year--over $1 trillion. That is greater than the defense 
budget, more than Social Security, more than Medicare. A record one in 
five households today received food stamps in 2013--one in five. The 
majority of them are working age. That is the first time that has 
happened that a majority of the recipients of food stamps are within 
the working age group.
  Our urgent national mission is to begin transitioning these 
struggling workers into good jobs with rising wages. Instead, the 
President proposes to increase Federal spending even more to sustain 
millions on welfare while increasing the supply and the admission of 
lower skilled immigrants to take the available jobs that exist.
  House leaders are reportedly rushing to assemble a plan that is 
similar to the President's. I hope not. But that is what is being 
suggested. This would be the worst thing they could do at such a time. 
Instead, the Democratic Senate having spoken, the Republican House must 
stand, expose the President's disastrous policies, and advocate a new 
direction that promotes assimilation, rising wages, and a growing 
middle class for all Americans, including those who have recently 
immigrated.
  Our lower skilled workers are the ones who are adversely affected the 
most from increased flows of immigrant labor into the country. I just 
hope we will consider this and talk honestly about it because it is not 
going away. It is a reality. The suggestion that somehow this will not 
happen is not so. The Congressional Budget Office, in scoring the 
Senate bill, concluded it would pull down wages of Americans for 20 
years.
  The last thing this Senate or any President of the United States 
should do would be to advocate and promote a policy that will pull down 
wages. We need to be looking for ways to increase wages. When you are 
in a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging. Do not make it 
worse. Do not create four or five applicants for every one job that 
exists in America.
  I hope the President will talk about that. I challenge him to talk 
about it. I am going to watch what he says. I expect him, as President 
of the United States addressing a joint session of Congress, to tell 
the truth and be accurate about his analysis and discussion of this 
important issue. It is important to America. We believe in immigration, 
but we want a lawful system of immigration, an immigration system that 
first and foremost does not damage, hurt, and weaken the financial 
position of already struggling American workers. Isn't that our first 
responsibility?
  We should create this lawful system in a way that serves the long-
term interests, the legitimate long-term interests of the United States 
of America and all the people who are in it, not just a few special 
ones with big money and special political power.
  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a 
quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak about the flood insurance 
bill. I am speaking with a smile on my face because I believe we have 
the 60 votes to break the filibuster so we can get to the bill. I would 
hope that if we exceed that 60-vote threshold, indeed those who have 
been trying to torpedo this bill would then, instead of stringing us 
out all week, making us go through all of the parliamentarian 
procedures when we have the votes, would let us get it passed.
  The problem is going to be down at the other end of that hallway 
because the Speaker of the House has already said that he does not like 
it. But what he is going to find out that he does not like is that a 
lot of Members of the House of Representatives have constituents who 
are facing 10-fold increases in their flood insurance because of 
something that was tacked onto a transportation bill.
  That was a year ago, Biggert-Waters, the sponsors in the House for 
this law which is now causing these unforeseen and never-expected huge 
increases. We can rectify that today. At 5:30 we are going to have the 
vote on the motion for cloture to cut off debate so that we can get to 
the bill.
  What does this bill do? It is really easy. It delays these giant rate 
hikes for 4 years, and it mandates on FEMA an affordability study so 
that we can see. I mean, you can say you want rates to go up and be 
actuarially sound. But if what happens is what has been happening, that 
people cannot afford it because it is 10 times as much, or that because 
it is so high it completely dries up the real estate market, that is 
not helping anybody.
  That is hurting a lot of people. It is hurting our economic recovery 
just at the moment in which the real estate market is coming back all 
along the coasts of America, as well as along the rivers and lakes, the 
very places that flood insurance is necessary for a homeowner or a 
business.
  I might say that today, as I was in Florida, the temperature was in 
the 60s, moving to the 70s. I got off the plane here, and it was in the 
30s. But the chilling winds of Biggert-Waters, with the gargantuan 
flood insurance rate hikes--those chilling winds are not only killing 
real estate sales, they are killing commerce, and it is putting an 
impossible financial burden on our people.
  We can take care of this at 5:30. Some have opposed us the whole way 
as we have tried a handful of times to bring up this legislation, 
asking unanimous consent. Finally, thanks to the leader, who has forced 
the issue, we are going to vote on cutting off debate today.
  I have several documented cases along Florida's gulf coast where the 
premiums for flood insurance have gone up by 10 times. In one 
particular case in Pinellas County, chronicled by the Tampa Bay Times, 
the premium was $4,500, and it has gone to $45,000.
  No homeowner can endure and afford that kind of increase. In another 
case, a $1,400 flood insurance premium has gone to $14,000. It is the 
same. We should be around here promoting home ownership. But if the 
poor homeowner has a mortgage because they have gotten a loan from the 
bank, what is the bank going to do to require some security for their 
loan? They are going to require flood insurance.
  So how can we expect a homeowner to have to go through this. You can 
say this is a subsidized program. It is. But the big losses in the 
program have been because of very unusual climatic events. In the first 
place, it was Hurricane Katrina. That was an ordinary, garden-variety 
category 3 Hurricane. Those of us in Florida understand hurricanes.
  But what happened with this hurricane? It went to the east of New 
Orleans, so the counter clockwise winds were not coming directly from 
the gulf. They were coming in over New Orleans, over Lake 
Pontchartrain. It caused the lake to rise, it filled up the canals. The 
water rose in the canals. The water pressure against the side of the 
canals increased. There were faulty canal dikes, and they breached in a 
couple of places, and then all of the water flooded into parts of New 
Orleans and filled up the bowl of New Orleans.
  That was a huge loss to the Federal Flood Insurance Program. Then 
there was another extraordinary event. This was just a year ago. This 
was a category 1 storm, and it was extraordinary because it hit in the 
winter. Where did it hit? It hit the highly urbanized coasts of New 
Jersey, New York, and parts of New England. As a result, there were 
huge losses there and people were desperate to have assistance. Look at 
what those folks are facing with regard to the flood insurance hikes.

  We can take care of all of this at 5:30 p.m. this afternoon as we 
start the process of getting on the bill. I urge all of our Senators--
because sooner or later somebody in your State is going to face a 
flood, and they are going to get remapped. They may not be paying those 
rates now, but they are going to get remapped because of those floods,

[[Page S471]]

and then they are going to get hit with these unaffordable, gargantuan 
rate hikes on the premiums of Federal flood insurance--this is the 
right thing to do.
  I see my colleague from Utah. The Senator used to tell me they don't 
ever have floods there, but I will bet they do. Even though Utah is a 
dry State, I know Utah has water because it supports a population which 
is represented by my most distinguished and dear personal friend 
Senator Hatch.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear colleague. The Senator is a very close 
personal friend of mine too.
  I have to say we have had our floods out there too, and thank 
goodness we have had some of these things to help us, no question about 
it. The last one was in St. George. It was very devastating to people. 
I appreciate the Senator's work.


                    Alternative Affordable Care Act

  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a legislative proposal I 
unveiled yesterday with two of my colleagues, Senator Richard Burr and 
Dr. Tom Coburn, that represents our vision for an alternative to 
ObamaCare.
  Let me start by saying something that most Americans--from Utah to 
North Carolina to Oklahoma--know to be true: ObamaCare just is not 
working. Try as he might during the State of the Union Address 
tomorrow, President Obama will not be able to convince the American 
people that his health care law is anything other than an unmitigated 
disaster. This horribly misguided law puts government between people 
and their doctors. It includes over $1 trillion in new taxes and a new 
unsustainable entitlement.
  It includes mandates and regulations that have forced too many 
Americans off their health plans and businesses to cut back on hiring. 
It has done next to nothing to put a brake on skyrocketing health care 
costs that are hitting every family in this country.
  The three of us knew there was another way, a better way--a way that 
doesn't need 2,700 pages of government programs and mandates to enact 
commonsense reforms that the American people want and need.
  Let me say that these two Senators with whom I have joined on this 
proposal have been looking at this for some time, as have I. I commend 
them for their leadership.
  Our plan rests on four simple principles. First, repeal ObamaCare 
with all its costly mandates, taxes, and regulations in its entirety.
  Second, reduce costs by taking government out of the equation, and, 
instead, empowering consumers to make choices about their own health 
care.
  Third, provide commonsense consumer protections to protect 
individuals with preexisting conditions.
  Fourth, reform our broken Medicaid system by giving States more 
flexibility to provide the best coverage for their citizens.
  We are confident our plan will accomplish all of this, and it would 
do so without adding one red cent to our $17 trillion debt.
  These four principles are the core of what we unveiled today. They 
are smart, they make sense, and they are what the people of my State 
have been looking for, and I think the people of every State. We start

                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, my colleagues and I have come to the 
floor to talk about an issue that is at the heart of the discussion of 
our national debt and deficit; that is, health care spending.
  These days around Washington, there is a regular refrain echoing 
through the hallways: In order to fix our deficit, we must cut Medicare 
and Medicaid benefits. That is wrong. That idea is, according to the 
former CEO of Kaiser Permanente--somebody who knows a little something 
about health care--and I will quote him:

       . . . so wrong it's almost criminal. It's an inept way of 
     thinking about health care.

  I could not agree more.
  It was put this way by Froma Harrop, who is a columnist for my 
hometown paper, the Providence Journal. I will quote her: ``The dagger 
pointed at America's economic viability hasn't been the existence of 
government programs like Medicare, it's been the relentless rise in 
health care costs that plagues not only Medicare and Medicaid, but 
everyone who uses health care.''
  Attacking Medicare and Medicaid ignores the fact that our health care 
spending problem is systemwide and not just unique to Federal programs. 
Our colleague Senator Angus King has used the colorful metaphor that to 
go after Medicare and Medicaid when the problem is our health care 
system would be like attacking Brazil after Pearl Harbor--wrong target. 
It ignores the fact that we operate a widely inefficient health care 
system: 18 percent of our GDP compared to only 12 percent for our least 
efficient international competitors.
  So how can we continue to stem the rise in costs and improve our 
wildly inefficient health care system?
  Thankfully, many of the tools necessary to drive down costs have an 
interesting collateral benefit. They actually improve the quality of 
care for patients. The Affordable Care Act included 45 different 
provisions dedicated to redesigning how health care is delivered for 
the benefit of patients and taxpayers. These reforms support and 
encourage an ongoing delivery system reform movement--and there truly 
is a movement out there--driven by dedicated providers, payers, 
employers, and even some States that have worked for years to improve 
the quality and the safety and the effectiveness of health care.
  We are not discussing hypothetical improvements. We are not 
discussing theoretical cost savings. Today I am joined on the floor by 
colleagues who have seen how delivery system innovators in their States 
have achieved real improvements to quality, real improvements in 
patient outcomes, and real cost savings. In Congress, we can't get over 
yesterday's

[[Page S6057]]

quarrels about repealing or defunding ObamaCare, but out there in the 
real world health care leaders across the country are innovating 
forward, places such as the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, Intermountain 
Healthcare in Utah, Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, Gundersen 
Lutheran in Wisconsin, Palmetto Health in the Carolinas, and in Rhode 
Island, among other places, our own Coastal Medical.
  One Rhode Island practical example: When intensive care unit staff 
follow a checklist of basic instructions--washing their hands with 
soap, cleaning a patient's skin with antiseptic, placing sterile drapes 
over the patient and so forth--rates of infection plummet, and the 
costs of treating those infections disappear--no infection, no cost.
  These reforms have the triple benefit of protecting Medicare and 
Medicaid, improving patient outcomes, and dialing back health care 
spending for all Americans. How big is it? The President's Council of 
Economic Advisers has estimated that we could save approximately $700 
billion--that is billion with a ``b''--$700 billion every year--every 
year--in our health care system without compromising health outcomes. 
The Institute of Medicine took a look at the same question. They put 
the savings number at $750 billion.
  Other groups are even more optimistic. The New England Health Care 
Institute has reported that $850 billion could be saved annually. The 
Lewin Group and former Bush Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill--who as the 
CEO of Alcoa is deeply involved in the reform efforts in Pennsylvania 
that have been very successful and knows a fair amount about this--they 
estimate an annual savings of a staggering $1 trillion.
  Whatever the exact number is, what is clear is there is huge 
potential for savings in our health care system while improving or 
maintaining the quality of care. Since the Federal Government does 40 
percent of America's health care spending, when we get that right, 
taxpayers as well as patients become big winners from these reforms.
  I will close with two points: First, many of us are asking the Obama 
administration to set a hard cost savings target for these delivery 
system reform efforts. It may be $750 billion. Pick a number that will 
be a target to be actually achieved. A target--a measurable goal--will 
focus and guide and spur the administration's reform efforts in a 
manner that vague intentions to ``bend the health care cost curve'' 
simply cannot.
  Second, we need to put the full force of American innovation and 
ingenuity into achieving that serious cost savings target for our 
Nation's health care system. It is hard to do that without that target 
to strive toward.
  This is an issue where our Republican colleagues should be able to 
join us to accelerate these reforms in our health care delivery system 
and to move forward beyond tired-out calls to repeal ObamaCare so we 
can deal with the ongoing reality of health care reform.
  Let's give American families the health care system they deserve. 
Instead of waste and inefficiency, poor outcomes and missed 
opportunities, let's give them a health care system that is the envy of 
the world.
  I yield for my colleague, Senator Baldwin.
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for convening us and 
for giving us an opportunity to discuss the important topic of delivery 
system reform and to highlight some of the innovations that are 
occurring in our own States.
  I heard Senator Whitehouse talking about moving forward. It is 
actually the motto of the State of Wisconsin. One simple word: 
``Forward.'' Throughout our State's history, that motto has well 
represented our leadership in extending high-quality and affordable 
health care.
  Our health care providers and payers have pioneered forward-looking 
reforms that improve the quality of care and lower costs for families 
and for businesses. We are home to world-class, highly integrated 
health care systems. We make quality and outcomes data widely 
accessible to providers so they can measure their success against their 
peers. We stand at the forefront of using and advancing health care 
information technology. All of this affords some of the highest quality 
care in the country at a competitive cost.
  Congress has a lot to learn from Wisconsin's health care delivery 
systems. A recent Institute of Medicine report reinforced what we have 
known for a long time: that geographic variation in health care 
spending and utilization is real and that variations in health care 
spending are not consistently related to health care quality. For every 
State such as Wisconsin with higher quality outcomes and lower costs, 
there are five other States faring worse. Even within States, the 
regional variation in health care spending and quality is troublesome.
  Unfortunately, instead of advancing and fostering forward-thinking 
innovations such as those working in Wisconsin, far too many of my 
fellow lawmakers are looking backward when it comes to health care. In 
the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership has scheduled 
votes to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act almost 40 times. Some 
State governments--including, unfortunately, my own--have refused to 
move forward with America's new health care law and are undermining its 
effectiveness at every chance possible. Now some of my colleagues in 
the Senate are threatening to shut down the government if investments 
in our health care system are not stripped out of our budget entirely.
  Families and businesses in Wisconsin and across the country are tired 
of these political games. For as long as some of my colleagues and some 
of the Governors across this country remain glued to the past, waging 
political fights based on pure ideology, we lose golden opportunities 
to move health care reforms in our country forward. We should all be 
focused on building a smarter and more affordable health care system, 
not trying to tear down the law of the land.
  That is why I am so proud to stand on the floor with my colleagues 
tonight, committed to moving our Nation's health care system forward. 
By building on the best reforms to our health care delivery system that 
are embedded within the Affordable Care Act and making new improvements 
to how we deliver care in our country, we will lower health care costs, 
improve quality and strengthen our economic security and reduce the 
deficit. Better yet, we will have more States with health care systems 
such as Wisconsin's, and Wisconsin's system will be improved as well.
  The possibilities are exciting. I think one of the things Senator 
Whitehouse just mentioned bears repeating: There is widespread 
agreement that significant savings can be achieved in our health care 
system without compromising the quality of care. The figures he cited 
bear repeating: The Lewin Group and the former Treasury Secretary Paul 
O'Neill have estimated that we could save $1 trillion per year without 
affecting health care outcomes by enacting smart, targeted health care 
delivery reforms. The New England Health Care Institute pegged that 
number at $850 billion annually, the Institute of Medicine estimated 
this number to be $750 billion, and the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers foresees savings at $700 billion a year. No matter the exact 
figure, these are impressive savings that would strengthen our entire 
Nation.
  The Affordable Care Act has sparked this hard work of transforming 
health care delivery. The law provides health care practitioners with 
incentives to better integrate care, increase quality, and lower costs. 
These efforts are producing impressive results in Wisconsin. For 
example, the Pioneer Accountable Care Organization Program has offered 
financial incentives to meet quality and Medicare savings benchmarks. 
Bellin-ThedaCare Healthcare Partners in northeast Wisconsin has 
excelled with this program. In its first year of participation, Bellin-
ThedaCare earned $5.3 million in shared savings and lowered costs for 
its 20,000 Medicare patients by an average of 4.6 percent. While not 
every pioneer ACO has been as successful, the CMS Office of the Actuary 
believes this program could save Medicare up to $1.1 billion over 5 
years by simply better coordinating care.
  Wisconsin boasts six additional health care providers participating 
in the law's traditional Accountable Care Organization Program which 
the Department of Health and Human Services estimates could save up to 
$940 million over 4 years. Wisconsin health care providers are also 
taking part in

[[Page S6058]]

the Affordable Care Act's Partnership for Patients to improve health 
care quality. This public-private partnership engages hospitals, 
businesses, and consumer groups with the goal of preventing injuries 
and complications in patient care--including hospital-acquired 
conditions. The administration estimates that reducing medical errors 
and preventing conditions will save up to $35 billion in health care 
costs.

  Another public-private partnership--the Affordable Care Act's Million 
Hearts Initiative--is preventing heart attack and stroke. 
Cardiovascular disease costs this country $440 billion per year in 
medical costs and lost productivity. The initiative seeks to deliver 
better preventive care to stop 1 million strokes and heart attacks by 
the year 2017--in part by utilizing innovative technology. Wisconsin's 
own Marshfield Clinic designed a winning mobile application for the 
initiative. The app will encourage patients to get their blood pressure 
and cholesterol checked and to work with their health care providers to 
improve their heart health.
  Finally, the Affordable Care Act has empowered the CMS Innovation 
Center to develop new ideas to improve health care quality and lower 
costs for people enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's 
Health Insurance Program. A number of the center's projects are 
currently underway in Wisconsin. For example, the Children's Hospital 
of Wisconsin, Aurora HealthCare, and the Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare 
system have created a model to decrease emergency room visits for 
children. The estimated 3-year savings of that project is almost $3 
million. In addition, the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin is utilizing a 
provision in the Affordable Care Act to better integrate pharmacists 
into clinical care teams. That initiative is set to save over $20 
million in 3 years.
  This represents a small sampling of the delivery innovations being 
promoted through the Affordable Care Act that are saving us money right 
now. These parts of the law are empowering Wisconsin health care 
providers to provide higher quality care at reduced costs. Public 
officials who advocate for repealing the Affordable Care Act would end 
these impressive initiatives as well. Instead, we must build on these 
delivery reforms, as so much more can be done.
  To name two priorities, Wisconsin cardiologists have developed an 
innovative integrated network called SMARTCare to deliver better more 
efficient care for a vulnerable patient population. The Department of 
Health and Human Services should encourage this coordinated care model 
by investing in it and measuring its results.
  We should improve the law to increase access to Medicare claims data. 
The Wisconsin Health Information Organization currently holds over 65 
percent of health insurance claims data in the State--from private 
insurers and from Medicaid. The organization shares that data with 
health care providers so doctors can compare their performance--in 
terms of quality and cost--against their peers. This data-sharing 
promotes competition and it lowers cost. But due to current law, the 
organization cannot access Medicare data. If we open Medicare claims 
data, we will further improve quality and we will lower costs.
  Lawmakers have a clear choice: Go backward and try for the 40th time 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act or put progress in our country ahead 
of politics. We welcome our colleagues to join us in moving our country 
and our health care delivery system forward.
  I now yield for Senator Murphy.
  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank very much Senator Baldwin and 
thank the State of Wisconsin for, in a lot of ways, leading the way and 
showing us what is possible when it comes to delivery system reform.
  It is pretty amazing some of those statistics Senator Baldwin used 
when she talked about how much waste there is in the system today. The 
estimates are from the Council of Economic Advisers, $700 billion; from 
the New England Healthcare Institute, $850 billion. To put that in 
context, even if the median of the two is right--somewhere in the high 
$700 billion range--that is $100 billion more than we spend every year 
on the military. That is enough money to provide coverage for 150 
million more Americans. That is enough to pay the salaries of every 
single first responder personnel in the country, including 
firefighters, police officers, and EMTs for over a decade.
  It is an enormous amount of money that we are wasting today because 
we have a reimbursement system, as Senator Whitehouse said as well, 
that essentially rewards providers and hospitals and health care 
systems for providing volume rather than providing quality.
  We understand there is not a single health care provider in the 
country that does not get into this if not for their desire to provide 
quality health care. There is no malevolent motive involved here. But, 
ultimately, when you have to keep your doors open--as a medical 
practice, as a hospital, as a nursing home--and you get paid more the 
more medicine you practice and the more treatments you order and the 
more tests you have your patients undergo, then you are going to follow 
the money. It is time we reorient our reimbursement model under 
Medicare and Medicaid, and in partnership with our private insurers, so 
we are reimbursing based on the quality of medicine and the quality of 
the outcomes you provide rather than on how much stuff you order or 
prescribe.
  Let me talk about three examples of how we have succeeded already 
when it comes to changing the model of reimbursement.
  First, the issue of readmission rates. When you go into a hospital 
for a surgery, that hospital is going to get a set fee for the surgery 
and for the amount of time you spend in the hospital afterwards. It is 
called a bundle payment. Bundle payments are good because what it does 
is it encourages you to essentially use your resources wisely because 
you are not going to get paid more if you keep the person in the 
hospital for 10 days than if you keep the person in the hospital for 5 
days.
  But here is the problem when it comes to the care people were getting 
after a particular surgery. Because the hospital got a set payment for 
that period of time, they had an incentive to push the person out of 
the hospital as quickly as possible. That was an incentive not only 
because the payment itself did not get bigger the more amount of time 
you were in the hospital, but it also was incented that way because if 
the person went home too early and then they came back again to the 
hospital, the hospital got a second bundle payment when they came back. 
And if they came back a third time and a fourth time, they got another 
payment.
  So what was happening is there was an incentive to send people home 
before they were ready because not only would that save you money on 
the first bundled payment, but it actually made the hospital or the 
health system money in the long run because the person came back a 
second or a third or a fourth time.
  I do not think there was a single hospital in the Nation that was 
deliberately misaligning their care so they would have people coming 
back to the hospital a second or a third or a fourth time. I am not 
suggesting people were trying to game the system in that way. But what 
certainly was happening was that without an incentive that pulls you 
the other way--get the care right the first time--there was, 
unfortunately, insufficient care being provided.
  So the health care bill says: Listen, we will pay you for maybe the 
first readmission, maybe for really complicated procedures we will pay 
you for a second readmission, but at some point there has to be an end 
to this model. At some point it has to be up to you as the hospital or 
as the health care provider to get the care right the first or the 
second time so we are not on the hook for readmissions occurring times 
three or times four. That is a pretty simple change, but it can save 
hundreds of millions of dollars.
  The second example is accountable care organizations. We set up a 
bunch of Pioneer accountable care organizations. These are bigger 
systems of care, where you have primary care doctors networked with 
specialty care providers, working under one umbrella to coordinate the 
care of the sickest patients. There are different numbers, but they all 
tell the same thing, which is that the sickest 5 or 10 percent of 
patients in the country are taking up about 50 percent of annual 
medical expenditures. So if you do a better job of

[[Page S6059]]

coordinating the care of that small percentage of the medical 
population, you are going to save a lot of money.
  Accountable care organizations can do that. Instead of having siloed 
care, where a co-morbid patient goes to a primary care doctor over 
here, then a specialist here, then a specialist there, if they are all 
under one roof and they are talking to each other, then you can save a 
lot of money just by coordination. That is the theory. So the health 
care reform act put that theory into practice. It set up a pilot 
program by which Pioneer accountable care organizations--essentially, a 
beginning set of accountable care organizations--would be set up under 
a model through which Medicare would say: If you save money, we are 
going to deliver back to you some of those savings so that, in fact, 
there is not a disincentive to practice less medicine because if you 
practice less medicine, Medicare will take some of the savings and it 
will share with you some of the savings.
  Well, we have only had a year or so of returns from this model, but 
the results are pretty stunning. The average increase in costs per 
beneficiary has been--in the Pioneer ACOs--less than 50 percent of that 
for non-Pioneer ACO models. That is a pretty significant savings.
  In addition, go back to this question of readmissions. In 25 of the 
32 Pioneer ACOs, there was a lower risk-adjusted readmission rate than 
in non-Pioneer ACOs. Coordinated care where you are reimbursing an 
organization as opposed to just the individual physicians actually 
saves you a lot of money.
  Then third, the issue of outliers. What you find when you look at the 
data--and it may be that Senator Whitehouse talked about this--is that 
sometimes 60, 70, 80 percent of the system is practicing good medicine 
at the right cost, and it is really only a small handful of providers 
that are way outside of the median and all you have to do, when it 
comes to some subsets of reimbursement, is bring those outliers back 
into the median.
  Home care was a great example. In the Accountable Care Act, we said 
that for home care providers that had utilization rates that were far 
outside the median, we were going to stop reimbursing for those 
episodes that were far outside the median. CBO was not sure how to 
score it because they did not really know that was going to change 
people's practice. But it did. And it is estimated that single change, 
in controlling for the handful of outliers when it comes to high 
utilization rates in the home care line item, is going to get us almost 
$1 billion in savings over a 10-year period of time.
  When you look at home care, actually it is only a handful of areas in 
which you have these outpaced utilization rates compared to the rest of 
the country. It is places in Texas, it is places in certain counties in 
Florida. Most of the country is right where you should be. So part of 
reforming our delivery system is also taking care of these outliers.
  We have seen savings, whether it be in controlling readmission rates, 
setting up accountable care organizations, or taking on outliers within 
our home care system.
  Now it is time to do more because, before I turn it over to my good 
friend Senator Blumenthal, here is where the rubber hits the road.
  In about 10 years, Medicare starts taking in less money than it sends 
out. It does not go bankrupt all of a sudden, but it starts to become 
fiscally insolvent. There are only a handful of ways to stop that 
reality from happening. You can either ask beneficiaries to pay more 
out of pocket; you can cut their benefits, give them less; you can ask 
people to pay more into the system while they are working or you can 
make the system more efficient.
  It may be that we have to do a mix of those. But clearly the first 
three are not that palatable: reducing benefits, increasing copays, or 
increasing taxes. This is not a partisan issue. Both sides agree that 
in 10 years we have an accounting problem in Medicare. Both sides agree 
that we have to make changes today in order to stop that crisis from 
occurring.
  It strikes me that if the most conservative Republican and the most 
liberal Democratic sat down at a table and looked at those four 
options--increased copays, reduced benefits, increased taxes, or 
increased efficiencies--we would all agree. The conservative Republican 
and the liberal Democrat would agree, along with probably every other 
Member of this body, that is the first place you should go is to reduce 
inefficiencies. That is what the delivery system provides. So we have 
set up a working group here in the Senate which is beginning its work 
this week, that Senator Baldwin, Senator Whitehouse, Senator 
Blumenthal, I, and others will be building over the course of the late 
summer and fall. We hope it will draw interest from both sides of the 
aisle so we can start to put some meat on the bones when it comes to 
the changes in our delivery system that can be made to increase 
efficiencies so as to forestall the need to balance the Medicare books 
on the backs of taxpayers, workers, or beneficiaries.
  With that, let me yield the floor to my great friend from 
Connecticut, someone who both as a Senator and our State's attorney 
general has been fighting for health care consumers for a long time, 
Senator Blumenthal.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, Chris 
Murphy. Senator Murphy has been a long-time champion on this issue. My 
colleagues may wonder why two Senators from Connecticut, both of our 
Senators, are here on the floor and part of this working group seeking 
to lead on this critically important issue of health care delivery.
  The answer is we come from a State where it is working. We have seen 
the future in Connecticut's health care delivery system. It is still a 
work in progress, a lot of work still to be done, but Connecticut 
hospitals and providers and insurers and patients know it has to be our 
future, that cutting cost is essential to preserving and enhancing 
quality. Let me emphasize how important that basic principle is, 
because a lot of our colleagues believe there is a choice here between 
cutting costs and quality, that quality cannot be enhanced if we cut 
costs.
  In fact, the opposite is true. Cutting the cost of health care is key 
to enhancing and improving quality. It is the way we will reduce 
premature discharges from hospitals, that we will diminish the number 
of discharges from hospitals without proper rehabilitation plans, and 
cut the number of hospital-acquired infections. It is not only possible 
to do but it is essential. It is a way we avoid the false choice--and 
it is a false choice--between preserving Medicare on the one hand and 
avoiding increasing copays, decreasing benefits, or increasing taxes, 
as my colleague from Connecticut has said.
  I reject every one of those options as necessary to preserving 
Medicare. Increasing copays, decreasing benefits, or increasing taxes 
is not the way. In fact, increasing efficiencies and avoiding 
unnecessary wasteful and indeed harmful costs are necessary to preserve 
Medicare.
  My mother taught me a number of things. She said, No. 1, if you don't 
have something nice to say about someone, don't say anything. So I am 
not here to say not-so-nice things about the folks who say we ought to 
cut Medicare benefits. But I would oppose those kinds of cuts as 
unnecessary and harmful.
  She also said an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In 
fact, that basic truth is what will help save our health care system. 
Prevention of costs, prevention of illness, prevention of obesity and 
smoking, and other kinds of diseases and conditions that lead to 
increased health care costs are essential to this effort.
  My mother said also listen to your younger brother. My brother, Dr. 
David Blumenthal, has been a pioneer and an expert in this area. As 
much as it pains me to acknowledge that my younger brother knows a lot 
more about this subject than I do, in fact, he has been able to 
enlighten me and many of our colleagues here on this point. I mention 
him and the others who are experts and pioneers in this effort. He is 
one of many who have advised and provided that kind of enlightenment.
  Because there is no more kind of guesswork as to whether advances can 
be made in this area by cutting costs and raising quality. It has been 
documented. There are projections. It can be costed out. It can be 
scored, in my view. It can be the basis for action by my colleagues 
here in seeking to cut

[[Page S6060]]

costs that are skyrocketing out of control.
  I have seen these reforms at work throughout the State of 
Connecticut. This issue is of national importance, but it hits 
hospitals and providers in every one of our States. I have seen it and 
listened to folks who work at places such as St. Vincent's and 
Bridgeport Hospital, in Bridgeport; St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury; 
Yale-New Haven and Greenwich Hospital, Middlesex Hospital. All around 
the State of Connecticut, I have seen the checklists at work, the 
protocols for hand washing, the increased attention to quality care 
that has helped reduce costs. They have helped improve patient care 
while reducing cost. They reject this false choice between quality and 
cost cutting. Both are possible. Both are essential.
  We hear so much rhetoric about the Affordable Care Act in Washington. 
But in Connecticut, we see tangible examples of how it is working and 
making a difference. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is a 
historic opportunity for continuing this work and expanding it 
nationwide. We need to continue our dedication to health care reform.
  My colleagues and I have come to the floor today to call for smart 
reform that helps patients and avoids harm to them, and does not 
discourage providers from being a part of a Federal health care 
program. In fact, we need to identify areas of reforms within the 
health care system that we can address that will strengthen health care 
in this country and address the serious concerns about the skyrocketing 
costs of health care.
  We have seen a slowdown in the growth of national health care 
expenditures over the past year. But slow growth certainly does not 
mean a decrease in overall expenditures. Smart policy decisions require 
that we address the ongoing problem of health care spending in this 
country, and turn a corner for the good by reducing the current costs.
  I am concerned that there are shortsighted strategies, such as taking 
money from the Prevention and Public Health Care Fund established under 
the ACA, which has been a tactic unfortunately used by both parties in 
financing programs. That tactic will undermine our long-term efforts at 
reducing health care spending. The Prevention and Public Health Fund is 
used in Connecticut for programs such as mental health services and 
substance abuse prevention, as well as public health research and 
surveillance.
  These measures will ultimately result in lower health care spending 
through prevention and preventive health care. But we need to stay 
committed and stay the course. What we need to do now is to continue to 
work toward developing a sustainable health care system, through 
structural reforms such as the accountable care organizations, health 
maintenance organizations, patient-centered medical homes that have 
provided advances in this area, and have created provider organizations 
that lead to greater provider acceptance of responsibility for health 
care outcomes in their patients.
  Measuring the success of those organizations requires taking a closer 
look at whether the savings and outcome improvements actually 
materialize. We have to be hard-headed and clear-eyed about whether 
they are working. The metrics must be applied. We need to measure 
success. Mea.."

                         PRESIDENT OBAMA CARES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Wilson) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, ``ObamaCare'' was coined by the 
Republicans to mock the wonderful Affordable Care Act passed by 
Congress in 2010 and signed into law by President Obama.
  The recent Supreme Court decision proves that ObamaCare was the 
perfect nickname because President Obama cares. He cares about you. He 
cares about me. He cares about my friends on the Democratic side of the 
aisle and he cares about my friends on the Republican side of the 
aisle.

                              {time}  1100

  He cares about all Americans. President Obama cares about us, and he 
thinks that we should not have to worry about going broke just because 
someone in our family gets sick.
  Because Obama cares, every American has the right to affordable 
health care. And yet the Republicans hate it with every fiber of their 
being. Why?
  Don't Republicans get sick, too? Don't Republicans worry about having 
to file for bankruptcy just because someone in their family gets sick? 
Don't Republicans go to the emergency room with no insurance?
  Later this week, the Republicans will vote to repeal a law that 
proves that Obama cares. Not ``repeal and replace,'' as they said they 
would do when they made their Pledge to America--just repeal. In other 
words, get rid of it, period.
  How can the Republicans explain to their constituents the repeal of a 
law that affords health care for everyone? Are they trying to send a 
message that Republicans don't need health care?
  Republicans are not robots. They get sick, they need surgery, they 
feel pain, they hurt, they cry, they mourn, they weep. Access to 
affordable health care is a basic right. It's not a Republican right, a 
Democratic right or an Independent right. It's a basic right for all 
Americans.
  Hello. If you're out there somewhere in America today and you feel 
you don't need health care because you are invincible, well, you are 
not. Do you feel that the rest of us should pay your medical bills? 
Enough of that already.
  Do you feel that those less fortunate should suffer needlessly? Then 
you need to pray to your God for forgiveness.
  You must care. You must care about the less fortunate, the working 
poor, the foster child, the disabled, the elderly, the mentally ill, 
the homeless, those wracked with pain. And all of Congress must care.
  The Affordable Care Act shows that Obama cares. He cares enough to 
include a provision that ensures our children can no longer be denied 
health care because of a preexisting condition. Obama cares enough to 
include a provision that allows students and young people under 26 to 
stay on their parents' health insurance plan no matter where they live.
  Obama cares enough to add language that closes the Medicare doughnut 
hole so that seniors pay less for their prescription drugs. They no 
longer have to decide whether to fill their prescriptions or buy some 
food.
  Obama cares enough to put in provisions that insist that insurance 
companies cannot drop your coverage when you get sick or that prohibit 
insurance companies from placing annual and lifetime limits on your 
health care. Life is so unpredictable.
  And Obama cares enough to include a provision that prevents insurance 
companies from charging higher premiums for women just because they 
happen to be women.
  The law of our land says that if you have a car you must insure that 
car. If you have a mortgage, you must insure that mortgage. If you have 
a body, insure it. Keep it healthy. Get your checkups, take your 
medication. What is more important to you, your luxury car, your 
beautiful house, or a healthy body?
  Every Member of Congress has wonderful health care insurance, and our 
pharmacy bills are so cheap it's unbelievable. It's simply great being 
covered by my health care in Congress.
  Shouldn't we want the same for our constituents who sent us here to 
serve them? Shouldn't we care?
  President Obama cares. Nancy Pelosi cares. Steny Hoyer cares. James 
Clyburn cares. John Larson cares. Xavier Becerra cares, and I care.
  Republicans out there, can you hear me?
  You should make all Members of the U.S. House of Representatives 
care.

[[Page H4694]]

Contact and let them know that everyone needs the same health care 
amenities that they enjoy.
  Don't be hoodwinked by the tax rhetoric. Listen to the facts. Read 
the fine print. You deserve access to affordable health care. You need 
affordable care.
  Power to the people. Power to ObamaCare.

[Pages S2015-S2017]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as we know, today the Supreme Court began 
hearing arguments about the constitutionality of the affordable care 
act. It is one of the most critically important Supreme Court cases of 
our time. A Wall Street Journal editorial noted last Friday:

       Few legal cases in the modern era are as consequential, or 
     as defining, as the challenges to [this law]. . . . The 
     powers that the Obama administration is claiming change the 
     structure of the American government as it has existed for 
     225 years. . . . The Constitutional questions the Affordable 
     Care Act poses are great, novel, and grave.

  The editorial, entitled ``Liberty and ObamaCare,'' lays out the 
constitutional problems with the affordable health care act and focuses 
on the bill's centerpiece: the individual mandate to purchase health 
insurance. As the editorial notes, the case against this provision is 
anchored in ample constitutional precedent, and I quote their 
conclusion:

       The Commerce Clause that the government invokes to defend 
     such regulation has always applied to commercial and economic 
     transactions, not to individuals as members of society. . . . 
     The Court has never held that the Commerce Clause is an ad 
     hoc license for anything the government wants to do.

  I urge my colleagues to read this article, and I ask unanimous 
consent that it be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                [The Wall Street Journal, Mar. 22, 2012]

                         Liberty and ObamaCare

       Few legal cases in the modern era are as consequential, or 
     as defining, as the challenges to the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act that the Supreme Court hears beginning 
     Monday. The powers that the Obama Administration is claiming 
     change the structure of the American government as it has 
     existed for 225 years. Thus has the health-care law provoked 
     an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional showdown that 
     endangers individual liberty.
       It is a remarkable moment. The High Court has scheduled the 
     longest oral arguments in nearly a half-century: five and a 
     half hours, spread over three days. Yet Democrats, the 
     liberal legal establishment and the press corps spent most of 
     2010 and 2011 deriding the government of limited and 
     enumerated powers of Article I as a quaint artifact of the 
     18th century. Now even President Obama and his staff seem to 
     grasp their constitutional gamble.
       Consider a White House strategy memo that leaked this 
     month, revealing that senior Administration officials are 
     coordinating with liberal advocacy groups to pressure the 
     Court. ``Frame the Supreme Court oral arguments in terms of 
     real people and real benefits that would be lost if the law 
     were overturned,'' the memo notes, rather than ``the 
     individual responsibility piece of the law and the legal 
     precedence [sic].'' Those nonpolitical details are merely 
     what ``lawyers will be talking about.''
       The White House is even organizing demonstrations during 
     the proceedings, including a `` `prayerful witness' 
     encircling the Supreme Court.'' The executive branch is 
     supposed to speak to the Court through the Solicitor General, 
     not agitprop and crowds in the streets.
       The Supreme Court will not be ruling about matters of 
     partisan conviction, or the President's re-election campaign, 
     or even about health care at all. The lawsuit filed by 26 
     states and the National Federation of Independent Business is 
     about the outer

[[Page S2016]]

     boundaries of federal power and the architecture of the U.S. 
     political system.
       The argument against the individual mandate--the 
     requirement that everyone buy health insurance or pay a 
     penalty--is carefully anchored in constitutional precedent 
     and American history. The Commerce Clause that the government 
     invokes to defend such regulation has always applied to 
     commercial and economic transactions, not to individuals as 
     members of society.
       This distinction is crucial. The health-care and health-
     insurance markets are classic interstate commerce. The 
     federal government can regulate broadly--though not without 
     limit--and it has. It could even mandate that people use 
     insurance to purchase the services of doctors and hospitals, 
     because then it would be regulating market participation. But 
     with ObamaCare the government is asserting for the first time 
     that it can compel people to enter those markets, and only 
     then to regulate how they consume health care and health 
     insurance. In a word, the government is claiming it can 
     create commerce so it has something to regulate.
       This is another way of describing plenary police powers--
     regulations of private behavior to advance public order and 
     welfare. The problem is that with two explicit exceptions 
     (military conscription and jury duty) the Constitution 
     withholds such power from a central government and vests that 
     authority in the states. It is a black-letter axiom: Congress 
     and the President can make rules for actions and objects; 
     states can make rules for citizens.
       The framers feared arbitrary and centralized power, so they 
     designed the federalist system--which predates the Bill of 
     Rights--to diffuse and limit power and to guarantee 
     accountability. Upholding the ObamaCare mandate requires a 
     vision on the Commerce Clause so broad that it would erase 
     dual sovereignty and extend the new reach of federal general 
     police powers into every sphere of what used to be individual 
     autonomy.
       These federalist protections have endured despite the 
     shifting definition and scope of interstate commerce and 
     activities that substantially affect it. The Commerce Clause 
     was initially seen as a modest power, meant to eliminate the 
     interstate tariffs that prevailed under the Articles of 
     Confederation. James Madison noted in Federalist No. 45 that 
     it was ``an addition which few oppose, and from which no 
     apprehensions are entertained.'' The Father of the 
     Constitution also noted that the powers of the states are 
     ``numerous and infinite'' while the federal government's are 
     ``few and defined.''
       That view changed in the New Deal era as the Supreme Court 
     blessed the expansive powers of federal economic regulation 
     understood today. A famous 1942 ruling, Wickard v. Filburn, 
     held that Congress could regulate growing wheat for personal 
     consumption because in the aggregate such farming would 
     affect interstate wheat prices. The Court reaffirmed that 
     precedent as recently as 2005, in Gonzales v. Raich, 
     regarding homegrown marijuana.
       The Court, however, has never held that the Commerce Clause 
     is an ad hoc license for anything the government wants to do. 
     In 1995, in Lopez, it gave the clause more definition by 
     striking down a Congressional ban on carrying guns near 
     schools, which didn't rise to the level of influencing 
     interstate commerce. It did the same in 2000, in Morrison, 
     about a federal violence against women statute.
       A thread that runs through all these cases is that the 
     Court has always required some limiting principle that is 
     meaningful and can be enforced by the legal system. As the 
     Affordable Care Act suits have ascended through the courts, 
     the Justice Department has been repeatedly asked to 
     articulate some benchmark that distinguishes this specific 
     individual mandate from some other purchase mandate that 
     would be unconstitutional. Justice has tried and failed, 
     because a limiting principle does not exist.
       The best the government can do is to claim that health care 
     is unique. It is not. Other industries also have high costs 
     that mean buyers and sellers risk potentially catastrophic 
     expenses--think of housing, or credit-card debt. Health costs 
     are unpredictable--but all markets are inherently 
     unpredictable. The uninsured can make insurance pools more 
     expensive and transfer their costs to those with coverage--
     though then again, similar cost-shifting is the foundation of 
     bankruptcy law.
       The reality is that every decision not to buy some good or 
     service has some effect on the interstate market for that 
     good or service. The government is asserting that because 
     there are ultimate economic consequences it has the power to 
     control the most basic decisions about how people spend their 
     own money in their day-to-day lives. The next stops on this 
     outbound train could be mortgages, college tuition, credit, 
     investment, saving for retirement, Treasurys, and who knows 
     what else.
       Confronted with these concerns, the Administration has 
     echoed Nancy Pelosi when she was asked if the individual 
     mandate was constitutional: ``Are you serious?'' The 
     political class, the Administration says, would never abuse 
     police powers to create the proverbial broccoli mandate or 
     force people to buy a U.S.-made car.
       But who could have predicted that the government would pass 
     a health plan mandate that is opposed by two of three voters? 
     The argument is self-refuting, and it shows why upholding the 
     rule of law and defending the structural checks and balances 
     of the separation of powers is more vital than ever.
       Another Administration fallback is the Constitution's 
     Necessary and Proper Clause, which says Congress can pass 
     laws to execute its other powers. Yet the Court has never 
     hesitated to strike down laws that are not based on an 
     enumerated power even if they're part of an otherwise proper 
     scheme. This clause isn't some ticket to justify inherently 
     unconstitutional actions.
       In this context, the Administration says the individual 
     mandate is necessary so that the Affordable Care Act's other 
     regulations ``work.'' Those regulations make insurance more 
     expensive. So the younger and healthier must buy insurance 
     that they may not need or want to cross-subsidize the older 
     and sicker who are likely to need costly care. But that 
     doesn't make the other regulations more ``effective.'' The 
     individual mandate is meant to offset their intended 
     financial effects.
       Some good-faith critics have also warned that overturning 
     the law would amount to conservative ``judicial activism,'' 
     saying that the dispute is only political. This is reductive 
     reasoning. Laws obey the Constitution or they don't. The 
     courts ought to defer to the will of lawmakers who pass bills 
     and the Presidents who sign them, except when those bills 
     violate the founding document.
       As for respect of the democratic process, there are plenty 
     of ordinary, perfectly constitutional ways the Obama 
     Democrats could have reformed health care and achieved the 
     same result. They could have raised taxes to fund national 
     health care or to make direct cross-subsidy transfers to sick 
     people. They chose not to avail themselves of those options 
     because they'd be politically unpopular. The individual 
     mandate was in that sense a deliberate evasion of the 
     accountability the Constitution's separation of powers is 
     meant to protect.
       Meanwhile, some on the right are treating this case as a 
     libertarian seminar and rooting for the end of the New Deal 
     precedents. But the Court need not abridge stare decisis and 
     the plaintiffs are not asking it to do so. The Great 
     Depression farmer in Wickard, Roscoe Filburn, was prohibited 
     from growing wheat, and that ban, however unwise, could be 
     reinstated today. Even during the New Deal the government 
     never claimed that nonconsumers of wheat were affecting 
     interstate wheat prices, or contemplated forcing everyone to 
     buy wheat in order to do so.
       The crux of the matter is that by arrogating to itself 
     plenary police powers, the government crossed a line that 
     Justice Anthony Kennedy drew in his Lopez concurrence. The 
     ``federal balance,'' he wrote, ``is too essential a part of 
     our constitutional structure and plays too vital a role in 
     securing freedom for us to admit inability to intervene when 
     one or the other level of government has tipped the scale too 
     far.''
       The constitutional questions the Affordable Care Act poses 
     are great, novel and grave, as much today as they were when 
     they were first posed in an op-ed on these pages by the 
     Washington lawyers David Rivkin and Lee Casey on September 
     18, 2009. The appellate circuits are split, as are legal 
     experts of all interpretative persuasions.
       The Obama Administration and its allies are already 
     planning to attack the Court's credibility and legitimacy if 
     it overturns the Affordable Care Act. They will claim it is a 
     purely political decision, but this should not sway the 
     Justices any more than should the law's unpopularity with the 
     public.
       The stakes are much larger than one law or one President. 
     It is not an exaggeration to say that the Supreme Court's 
     answers may constitute a hinge in the history of American 
     liberty and limited and enumerated government. The Justices 
     must decide if those principles still mean something.

  Mr. KYL. Finally, continuing on the point about the argument on 
ObamaCare and referring to a different piece that appeared in the Wall 
Street Journal, I wanted to talk just a little bit in more detail about 
the justification of this mandate to purchase health insurance, the 
requirement that every individual in the United States be the recipient 
of a specifically defined policy by the U.S. Government.
  The rationale the government has provided is that if we do not do 
this, then free riders or people who do not have insurance but might 
get sick will end up shifting all of the burden of their care onto the 
rest of us, and therefore the government needs to regulate that by 
forcing everybody to buy insurance. On March 20 the Journal published a 
piece by Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Vernon Smith, a former CBO Director 
and an economics professor, respectively, which I think really debunks 
this argument on the merits. It explains the real reason this mandate, 
as well as a dramatic expansion of Medicaid, is unconstitutional. I 
just wanted to highlight the points they make.
  First, Holtz-Eakin and Smith address this individual mandate 
question. States, of course, have general police power to regulate the 
conduct of their citizens, but Federal power, by contrast, is very 
limited over individuals.
  The authors make the important point that heath care policy has 
traditionally been a State function. Health

[[Page S2017]]

care needs relate to individuals and vary from person to person and 
region to region. As a policy matter, States have a better 
understanding of what kind of improvements to health care access are 
needed.
  Here is what they wrote:

       The administration's attempt to fashion a singular, 
     universal solution is not necessary to deal with the 
     variegated issues arising in these markets. States have taken 
     the lead in past reform efforts. They should be an integral 
     part of improving the functioning of health-care and health-
     insurance markets.

  If the States have the legal power to address health issues and are 
better equipped to do so, then where does the justification for Federal 
jurisdiction come from? The authors note that the administration's 
argument is that the Federal Government mandate is needed to address 
the cost-shifting, the thing I talked about before. But they note that 
this is a red herring. ``In reality,'' the authors write, ``the mandate 
has almost nothing to do with cost-shifting.'' That is because, in 
actuality, the young and the healthy--the people who are not buying 
health insurance--aren't imposing much of a burden on the system 
because they do not get sick that often. They do not need as much 
insurance because they do not need as much health care. The authors say 
that ``the insurance mandate cannot reasonably be justified on the 
ground that it remedies costs imposed on the system by the voluntarily 
uninsured.'' In other words, as I said, there is not that much free-
riding going on.
  The authors conclude that the real purpose of the mandate is not to 
decrease the costs of uncompensated care, it is meant to force the 
young and the healthy to buy health insurance at rates far above the 
amount and scope of coverage they actually need because they are 
generally healthy individuals. But this extra money will help fund 
health insurance companies and therefore offset the huge increased 
costs imposed upon them by ObamaCare's many new regulations. This is 
the real reason for the individual mandate. In fact, as an amicus brief 
by over 100 economists points out, ``The [Affordable Care] Act is 
projected to impose total net costs of $360 billion on health insurance 
companies from 2012 to 2021.'' With the mandates, however, ``insurance 
companies can be expected to essentially break even.'' This is no 
coincidence.
  If this is the real justification for the mandate to purchase health 
care, I submit it should have been done through an enumerated power--
perhaps under the tax power of the Federal Government, which is at 
least one of the powers the Constitution explicitly provides.
  In any event, this individual mandate cannot be justified to regulate 
interstate commerce. The supporters of the mandate have therefore 
introduced a second argument. They say health care is just different 
from all other commerce. It is bigger. Everybody has to have health 
care--as if they did not have to have food on the table or shelter over 
their head or clothes on their back and so on. In any event, they say 
health care is different and somehow this difference gives Congress the 
right to force people to buy government-mandated health insurance under 
its power to regulate interstate commerce. But the argument that ``this 
particular market is just different'' is beside the point even if it 
were true because it does not articulate a constitutional limitation 
that is judicially enforceable.
  The question before the Court is whether there is any limit to 
Congress's power to regulate commerce. Obviously, the Framers would 
never have countenanced a Federal requirement to purchase a product so 
that the government could then regulate it. So what limit on 
constitutional power is suggested by the health care market? None. That 
is precisely the point. The government cannot draw a line, and, as a 
result, it would have to argue that there is no limit to its powers, 
and that, of course, would run counter to the reason the Framers put 
limitations into the Constitution.
  The individual mandate is not the only provision in ObamaCare that is 
constitutionally impermissible. The Medicaid expansion is also 
violative. While Congress has well-established power to use its purse 
strings to encourage the States to adopt certain Federal policies, it 
cannot force them or compel them to do so. ObamaCare's Medicaid 
expansion essentially coerces the States into complying with new 
Medicaid policies.
  This occurs in two different ways. First, if a State does not comply 
with the ObamaCare eligibility expansion, it would lose all of its 
Federal Medicaid funds--even for patient populations that the State had 
already covered long before ObamaCare was passed. Few if any States 
would be able to continue their existing Medicaid Programs if they lost 
all of this Federal funding.
  An amicus brief signed by over 100 economists examined Medicaid data 
to determine the economic impact of States losing all of their Medicaid 
funds, and it found that if States were forced to absorb Federal 
Medicaid expenditures into their own State budgets, ``the State's total 
budgetary expenditures would jump by 22.5 percent.'' In other words, 
there is no real choice. The options for States are to do as the 
Federal Government says or leave Medicaid, which by now is so engrained 
in the care for the indigent that unwinding it, in effect, 
disentangling it from existing Federal-State relationships, would be 
virtually impossible and would obviously jeopardize care for the 
population without other health coverage. This is coercion, plain and 
simple. It is unconstitutional.

  Second, ObamaCare expands Medicaid eligibility to everyone under 138 
percent of the Federal poverty level. For individuals who make less 
than 138 percent of the poverty level, ObamaCare provides no means for 
complying with the individual mandate other than enrolling in Medicaid. 
In their brief to the Supreme Court, the States suing over the Medicaid 
expansion said it best:

       When Congress mandates that Medicaid-eligible individuals 
     maintain insurance, but provides no alternative means for 
     them to obtain it, it is impossible to label the States' 
     participation in Medicaid voluntary.

  If it is the only way someone can get it, it is not voluntary.
  Well, ObamaCare, as a whole, cannot survive without these 
unconstitutional provisions, and these are the reasons I believe it 
will and can be struck down as unconstitutional.

                          ____________________

                  REPUBLICAN SOLUTIONS TO HEALTH CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2013, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for an important Special 
Order--this time, to focus on Republican solutions to our national 
health care crisis.
  The President's health care law has hurt more people than it has 
helped. Taxes are going up, premiums are rising to unaffordable levels, 
workers' hours are being cut, and people are losing the plans they 
like. After more than $500 million spent, the Web site doesn't even 
work. The truth is that, despite all these problems, the American 
people needed genuine health care reform before President Obama signed 
his signature law--and we still do.
  The American people deserve an alternative to the failures of the 
President's health care law, and we have one: The Affordable Health 
Care Reform Act. This important bill replaces the President's health 
care law with patient-centered reforms that genuinely lower costs while 
keeping you in charge of your health care.
  I have a few colleagues with me here today to join in this 
conversation. I certainly would like to start by yielding to 
Congressman Barton.
  Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.
  Mr. BARTON. Thank you. I want to recognize your leadership on the 
Republican Study Committee and the Health Task Force on preparing the 
legislation that you just referred to.
  I am the past chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the past 
ranking member of that committee; and when the Affordable Care Act came 
through the Congress, I was the senior Republican on the committee of 
jurisdiction.

                              {time}  1715

  I don't want to tell you and the American people that I told you so, 
but I told you so. We knew that this wasn't going to work.
  For example, we had a hearing today about the Affordable Care Act in 
the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. 
It was focusing on the security of the Web site and on all of the 
problems and when the administration knew about those problems and what 
they did or didn't do. In the course of that hearing, Congressman Cory 
Gardner of Colorado was asking the senior civil servant, Mr. Chao from 
CMS, some questions.
  The gentleman from CMS just kind of, off the cuff, said, You know 
that 60 to 70 percent of the programs haven't been developed yet.
  Congressman Gardner followed up and said, What are you talking about?
  He said, All we are working on right now is the Web site to get 
people registered. We haven't completed that portion of the program 
about billing, that portion about accounting for treatment, how we 
interact with the hospitals and the patients and the doctors. 
Basically, 60 to 70 percent of the system has not been programmed yet.
  Mr. MESSER. Unbelievable.
  Mr. BARTON. Can you imagine that, if we are having the horrendous 
problems we are having on just getting people interacted with making 
choices of which kind of coverage they are going to choose, the 
problems you are going to have when you actually begin to have to use 
the system for real health care in January?
  So I and, I think, you and the other members of the Republican Study 
Committee task force on health, who helped prepare the legislation that 
you are talking about, are going to begin to push to delay the 
Affordable Care Act.
  I have a bill, H.R. 3348, that makes it voluntary the first year in 
that we are not going to impose the individual mandate on people. The 
President has already delayed the employer mandate for a year. My bill, 
H.R. 3348, would delay the individual mandate so that, as we work 
through all of the problems, people can choose to participate or can 
choose not to participate.
  I think it is becoming more apparent every day that the Affordable 
Care Act is like that shiny automobile that you see when you go into 
the showroom or go to the car lot. You see it, and the salesman says, 
Man, this thing is great. It gets 30 miles a gallon. It doesn't use 
much oil. Everything is power steering, and it has air-conditioning and 
a great stereo system. So you put down your down payment, and you take 
it out on the road. Son of a gun. The thing doesn't go above 50. It 
burns oil like it is going out of style. The air-conditioning doesn't 
work. The stereo system barely works. It is just a lemon.
  The Affordable Care Act is a lemon, and the American people and the 
Democrats on the other side of the aisle who voted for it are having 
buyer's remorse.
  So what we need to do is to delay it or to repeal it or to at least 
make it voluntary. Then let's look at some of these alternatives like 
the legislation that we put into play in which we give people real 
choices. It is a patient-centered, client-centered system. We allow 
insurance to be sold across State lines. We beef up affordable savings 
accounts, Health Savings Accounts. We do cover preexisting conditions, 
which I know you will talk about later on, but we do

[[Page H7239]]

it with a high-risk pool on a State-by-State basis.
  The Democrats have told us time after time in the general debate that 
you Republicans are against the Affordable Care Act, but you don't have 
an alternative.
  We have an alternative, and I think it is a good alternative. I am a 
sponsor of the legislation, and I am here to support you in this 
Special Order. As we go through and outline what is in it, I think the 
American people and the other Members of the House who are watching 
these proceedings--more and more of them--will say, We don't like that 
lemon that we have. Maybe we ought to go back, and maybe we ought to 
start over. Maybe some of these ideas in the alternative we should take 
a serious look at.
  So I commend you for your work on the legislation, and I also commend 
you for leading this Special Order this evening.
  Mr. MESSER. Thank you. Once again, I appreciate the gentleman's 
leadership. I appreciate your longstanding leadership on this important 
issue and your longtime leadership in Texas as well.
  As you have said, nobody wants to say, ``I told you so,'' but, 
unfortunately, what has unfolded in the most recent weeks and months is 
exactly what was predicted by folks on your committee and elsewhere 
because you could see from the beginning that the bill was 
fundamentally flawed and just didn't work.
  I want to cite to this Chamber the number 701. According to the 
Department of Health and Human Services, that is the number of Hoosiers 
who have successfully signed up for health insurance on the Affordable 
Care Act exchanges. Indiana isn't alone. States across the country are 
experiencing dismal enrollment numbers. What is worse is that millions 
of Americans, including 108,000 Hoosiers, are getting policy 
cancelation notices from their health insurance companies. These 
notices are coming at a faster rate than people are able to sign up for 
the health care plans under the President's health care bill.
  The President called a press conference once again last week to 
announce to the American people that, if you like your health care 
plan, you can keep it. The problem is, no matter how many times the 
President makes that promise, the promise still isn't true. Saying the 
promise over and over again doesn't magically make it true.
  One of my constituents, Michael Sturgis of Greensburg, called to let 
me know that he received a cancelation letter from his insurance 
company. He was told his monthly premium was going to increase from 
$397 a month to $831 a month--an almost $500 increase per month. His 
$5,000 deductible will now go up to $7,300. So he is spending more 
money for a plan that gives him less.
  This is unacceptable, and it is certainly not affordable. That is why 
we need to pass the American Health Care Reform Act. It is so people 
like Michael and the millions of Americans like him all across this 
country can remain in charge of their own health care.
  Now I would like to yield to a colleague of mine, another person who 
has shown great leadership on this important issue and who is a close 
personal friend of mine as well, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
Meadows).
  Mr. MEADOWS. I thank the gentleman. I thank, more importantly, his 
heart on representing the people of the great State of Indiana and on 
the fact that he is concerned on a daily basis. We have had 
conversations a number of times on not only how this health care law is 
affecting families but, truly, on how we must find a way to work 
together in a bipartisan way to stop the harmful effects on those men 
and women whom we call neighbors, friends, and constituents. So I thank 
the gentleman for yielding.
  Americans across the country are already feeling the impacts of 
ObamaCare, and many of them are fearful of what lies ahead. I know, in 
my State alone, we have had over 473,000 people who have lost their 
health care coverage due to cancelations because of ObamaCare. They 
keep asking, What is coming next? What is the next thing? Whether it is 
a Web site that doesn't work, whether it is the cancelation of 
policies, whether it is security concerns over the Web site that are 
existing, they are all concerned.

  I held a town hall meeting last night, and 85 percent of the callers' 
questions were related to ObamaCare. I don't think we have ever seen it 
so overwhelmingly lopsided in terms of one issue. Yet it was all about 
families, and for me, it was the families of western North Carolina.
  I had veterans asking me, Does this mean that I am going to lose my 
health care coverage? Is TRICARE going to be sucked into ObamaCare? 
Even though we have had promises to the contrary, we know that there is 
a real move afoot to minimize and to bring it down. So our commitment 
to our veterans is one that has to stay strong, and we have to be 
committed to that. I know that you agree with me on that particular 
issue.
  There was a wife who was worried about how she and her husband were 
going to be able to afford the premiums because their premiums had 
tripled. They said, We just don't know how we are going to be able to 
afford it. Then I had a business owner who employs, he said, between 26 
and 28 people. He said, I am not sure how we are going to be able to 
continue to provide health care coverage as premiums escalate. It is 
all about trying to make sure that I keep them gainfully employed, and 
now I am having to try to figure out how we pay for these premiums that 
have increased.
  These are real people. This is not politics. They have faces and 
names, and we have got to address it.
  People across the country have become gravely concerned. A recent 
poll showed more than 58 percent of the people believe that ObamaCare 
is not ready for prime time. In spite of this overwhelming stress over 
ObamaCare, the one question I continue to hear is: What is your 
solution?
  Many of the Democrats have claimed that Republicans only want to 
repeal the law rather than to try to fix it, but I can tell you that 
that is not the case because, even in this Congress, Republicans have 
offered over 102 bills to fix some of the problems with the Affordable 
Care Act while the Democrats have only offered 17 solutions.
  Now, last week, we passed one of those solutions, the Keep Your 
Health Plan Act, to make sure that if you like your health care plan 
that you can keep it, but much more needs to be done. The American 
Health Care Reform Act, which you were talking about, now has over 102 
cosponsors. It is a comprehensive solution that was put forth by House 
Republicans to address the serious problems that we have in our 
Nation's health care system.
  It is a multifaceted piece of legislation that provides an array of 
reforms and lower costs, which is something that the current bill 
really doesn't do. We talk about affordable care, but it hasn't really 
been lowering the costs. This is one that keeps it patient-centered and 
makes sure that health care is a decision between the doctor and the 
patient, not between the government and the patient. It provides those 
tax reforms for families and companies, and it levels the playing field 
in providing for health care for all Americans. It fully repeals the 
President's health care law. It eliminates billions in taxes and 
thousands of pages of unworkable regulations and mandates that we have 
already seen, and we are only now starting to find out what the 
implications are. It spurs competition to lower health care costs as we 
know that competition will do that. Yet it allows for the purchase of 
health insurance across State lines, enabling small businesses to kind 
of pool together in order to lower those health care costs, but it is 
really about reforming what we are seeing.
  It reforms medical malpractice laws in a commonsense way that limits 
trial lawyers' fees, but yet, at the same time, it does not diminish 
the protection for our patients if something were to go wrong. It 
expands Health Savings Accounts so that they can use pretax dollars to 
provide for their health care expenses.
  Ultimately, it is a safeguard. It safeguards us against those 
preexisting conditions. I know you have heard from your constituents, 
as I have from mine, that one of the good things about the Affordable 
Care Act is it makes sure those preexisting conditions are

[[Page H7240]]

covered. This does the same thing. It makes sure that they are 
protected. Yet, at the same time, it makes sure that those high-risk 
pools are extended and guaranteed that availability--a protection that 
many Americans depend on and need.
  I just want to thank you for your leadership on this particular 
issue. I believe it is time we worked together in a bipartisan way to 
fix this problem piece of legislation. We have put forth a proposal, 
and I urge my colleagues across the aisle to join us. I thank you for 
your leadership in highlighting this this evening.
  Mr. MESSER. Thank you. I certainly appreciate the gentleman and his 
leadership. I am sure you have been asked by many, both privately and 
publicly, the same thing that I have been asked, which is: Aren't you 
just really rooting for ObamaCare to fail?

                              {time}  1730

  The comment I make every time I am asked that question is, no, I am 
rooting for the millions of Americans who are now being harmed by this 
bill. All the moms and dads that are worried about whether they are 
going to have insurance that had it before. The people who were 
promised things, that they would suddenly magically have insurance, and 
now they are not getting it.
  In the areas across the country where there were promises that rates 
would go down and now rates are going up, those folks now are caught at 
this point. I do think we have a responsibility. You and I both know, 
anybody that has been following here, we were opposed to ObamaCare and 
led efforts, along with many others, to try to make sure that we didn't 
have it.
  We also have always recognized that the status quo wasn't acceptable 
in health care either. That while we had a lot of great things in our 
system--certainly some of the best health care treatment in the world--
we had a program that was unaffordable and rates were going up.
  We have free enterprise-based, patient center-based solutions that 
can make a difference.
  I appreciate your leadership and highlighting this.
  Mr. MEADOWS. You are absolutely right. I know that I have got 
physicians in North Carolina that are looking at retiring because of 
dealing with the bureaucracy of this new law. We have got hospitals who 
thought it was going to be a great advantage to them in covering those 
costs that are now looking and saying, well, the implementation of it 
is really--what we were promised and what we are getting may not be 
exactly the same.
  We need to make sure that we right this ship, that we do what is 
right.
  I am honored to be able to cosponsor this legislation with you and 
look forward to your leadership, and I thank you.
  Mr. MESSER. Thank you very much.
  For months, the President has unilaterally enacted modifications, 
repeals, and delays to his own law, yet none of those so-called 
``fixes'' have fixed this flawed law. Health care costs have continued 
to skyrocket. This is a huge burden on employers, individuals, and 
families.
  The American Health Care Reform Act will drive down the cost of 
health care through increased competition, individuals will be able to 
purchase health insurance across State lines and, as my colleague 
highlighted, businesses can pool together to get the same buying power 
as large corporations.
  Under the American Health Care Reform Act, families will have the 
flexibility to pick the coverage that best fits their needs. When 
people are in charge of their own health care, they become better 
consumers, which will encourage competition in the health care market. 
Real savings will only happen when people, not Washington bureaucrats, 
are in charge of their own health care.
  Next up, I would like to highlight a real leader on this important 
issue of providing an alternative to the failed programs of the 
President's health care law, my friend and colleague from Louisiana, 
the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mr. Scalise. Great to 
have you here.
  Mr. SCALISE. I want to thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Messer from 
Indiana, for yielding and for your leadership in talking about this 
here on the House floor.
  I think a lot of us over the last few years that this law has been on 
the books, while we have been pointing out all of the many problems 
that it is creating for families, we predicted, unfortunately, we saw 
this coming. This ``train wreck,'' as it was called by the lead sponsor 
in the Senate who rammed the bill through, he called it a train wreck 
recently because he finally acknowledged how devastating this would be. 
Of course, the President, we all remember that promise that was 
repeated time and time again: If you like what you have, you can keep 
it. Something we all embrace.
  Of course, I knew, you knew, so many of us knew, I think even the 
President knew, unfortunately, when he was making that promise time and 
time again for the last 3 years, that that promise could not be kept 
under the President's health care law; just with all the mandates, all 
the unworkable taxes and mandates and these government bureaucrats that 
come between patients and doctors and get in the middle of health care, 
and IRS agents coming with the hammer to enforce this law.
  We all knew. We saw that there would be no way people would be able 
to keep the health care that they liked. While we repeated it many 
times, it wasn't real until recently when millions--millions--of 
families started getting cancelation notices, losing the good health 
care that they have today and enjoy.
  I have gotten letters from so many of my constituents. We reached out 
through social media with Facebook and Twitter and Share with Steve and 
asked for their stories. I remember Shaun from Covington who said, I am 
losing the good health care I have.
  I posed the question to Secretary Sebelius at a hearing. I said, here 
is a guy in my district, we are hearing this over and over again, he is 
losing his health care, what do you tell him? She said, well, just go 
in the marketplace. Of course this is the Web site that doesn't work 
that spent over $500 million of taxpayer money. Not one person has been 
held accountable, by the way, for that failure.
  As we point out all these failures, we also said there is a better 
way. We as conservatives stepped forward and said, we ought to put down 
on paper the things we stand for: market-driven, consumer-patient 
oriented health care reforms that actually lower costs, that will 
actually increase access. We put it together in a bill called the 
American Health Care Reform Act, H.R. 3121, a bill anybody can go look 
up and read. In fact, a bill that is less than 200 pages long with all 
the great reforms in it. Of course, comparing and contrasting that to 
the President's health care law with over 2,700 pages, all these 
unworkable mandates.
  What the bill does is just basic commonsense reforms that should have 
been done years ago. We, of course, as you mentioned, allow people to 
buy across State lines. People in America, probably some of the best 
consumers in the world, with the Internet with so many options, people 
go online every day and find good products for their family. They don't 
care where that product is from. If it is good for their family, they 
are going to buy it.
  With health care you really can't do that. You don't really have that 
opportunity. The health care law has taken those options away from 
families. So we say, let's empower people again, let's put patients 
back in charge of their health care decisions.
  I am from Louisiana. If I find a better deal for my family in the 
State of Maryland, I can go buy that plan. I should be able to buy that 
plan. Right now I really can't. Yet you do that with car insurance and 
so many other products. You are able to buy across State lines, and it 
gives you opportunities.
  We do so many other things to make sure people with preexisting 
conditions can't be discriminated against, allowing small businesses to 
pull together.
  Again, this is a bill that has been put together by conservatives in 
the House. In fact, a number of medical doctors, actual medical 
doctors, people with real world experience in health care, helped draft 
this bill and, ultimately, we brought it forward and we have over 100 
cosponsors.

  So I think the momentum is building as the President's law just 
continues to

[[Page H7241]]

collapse and, frankly, the President's credibility collapses with it. 
People I think are looking for that better way, and we have it with the 
American Health Care Reform Act.
  Again, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for his leadership, and I 
yield back.
  Mr. MESSER. I certainly appreciate the gentleman from Louisiana and 
his leadership. I know you were quoted over the weekend on FOX News by 
George Will describing the tragic circumstances that most Americans see 
themselves in, those that have lost their health care plan. I would 
like you to expand on that just a little bit, if you don't mind.
  Mr. SCALISE. Sure. One of the things we have heard so much from this 
administration about health care as they have referred to people's 
plans, good plans, they refer to many of them as ``lousy'' plans. I 
have been in hearings where we have had Obama administration officials, 
in fact the President himself goes around chastising people and saying, 
you might be losing your plan, but it probably wasn't that good of a 
plan anyway.
  Who is it for some Washington politician to tell somebody, and in 
Covington, Louisiana, as a constituent of mine, Shaun, said, who is it 
for the President to say that Shaun's plan was lousy when Shaun liked 
his plan? The President's promise was not, ``If Barack Obama likes what 
you have, you can keep it.'' The promise was, ``If you like what you 
have, you can keep it.'' No Washington politician or bureaucrat or IRS 
agent should be able to take that away from you.
  Yet, as that was happening and they are berating people saying, your 
plan wasn't that good, it was a lousy plan, I said it is kind of like a 
guy who burns down your house and then he shows up with an empty bucket 
of water and then he sits there and gives you a lecture on how bad and 
lousy your house was before the fire. All you want is your house back. 
You didn't want somebody to burn it down in the first place.
  People just want their good health care. They sure don't want to be 
lectured by some bureaucrat or politician in Washington saying, hey, 
your plan really wasn't that good because I don't think it was that 
good; when, in fact, the person back home is saying, I thought it was 
good, it was good for my family, my doctor can go see my kids, and I 
want to continue that relationship with my doctor, and they are about 
to lose it. They are losing it with these Washington politicians who 
helped ram this bill through.
  That is why I think, as the President's health care law collapses on 
all the weight of these unworkable mandates and taxes, we need to put 
up an alternative, and we have an alternative called a better way--the 
American Health Care Reform Act.
  We want to help bail those people out with a real bucket of water and 
a real relief sign that there is something that we are doing, not only 
to point out how bad the law is--they are seeing it play out every 
day--but also how we can actually fix the problems that are becoming 
even worse because of this law.
  Mr. MESSER. Again, I thank the gentleman. Thank you for your 
leadership.
  As we have talked about before, the American people needed health 
care reform before the disaster of ObamaCare rolled out. Obviously, we 
need it now more than ever given the failings of recent days. H.R. 
3121, the American Health Care Reform Act, is an answer.
  There are several principles upon which we should all be able to 
agree when it comes to genuine health care reform.
  First, patients should not be denied health insurance because of 
preexisting conditions.
  Second, any Federal policy changes must be designed to drive costs 
down, not up, as we have seen under the so-called Affordable Care Act.
  Third, you should be able to keep your health care plan if you like 
it. I agree with former President Bill Clinton when he has said that, 
given that very clear promise that was made by President Obama on 
behalf of the Federal Government to the American people, we need to 
pass legislation--we have already passed a bill in the House--but we 
need to pass legislation that makes sure that promise is kept.
  Fourth, we need commonsense medical liability reform that puts an end 
to the expensive system of defensive medicine that we have now.
  Health care decisions should be left up to you and your doctor, not 
Washington bureaucrats.
  The American Health Care Reform Act is centered on these five 
principles.
  Frivolous lawsuits are driving up health care costs and forcing good 
doctors out of the medical field. The American Health Care Reform Act 
improves medical liability law. Frankly, Indiana has been a leader in 
this area because of leadership from former Governor ``Doc'' Bowen, a 
physician back in the 1960s. The Indiana medical malpractice reform 
approach would be a great Federal model, and its principles from that 
plan is a part of H.R. 3121, which we are talking about today.
  We need improved medical liability law that allows doctors to 
continue practicing medicine without fear of excessive and unfair 
penalties.
  I also would like to talk to you a little bit about the importance of 
medical savings accounts. Fellow Hoosier Pat Rooney is known as the 
``father of health savings accounts'' from his work as the president 
and CEO of Golden Rule. They were established in 2003 while Pat Rooney 
was the chairman of the Golden Rule Insurance Company. Pat believed 
people should own their own health care.
  Health savings accounts have proven to be a useful tool for 
individuals and families while navigating the health care system. Our 
plan, H.R. 3121, expands health savings accounts and enhances their 
performance by increasing the cap on contributions and expanding the 
allowable uses of health savings account funds. This gives people more 
control over how they spend their health care dollars and allows them 
to invest pretax dollars toward their future health care needs.
  Mr. Speaker, no one doubts that real reform is needed, but there are 
two distinct visions for the future of health care in our Nation.
  The President's plan expands the Federal Government's role in health 
care, raises taxes, and imposes unfair and unworkable mandates on the 
American people. Our plan, H.R. 3121, the American Health Care Reform 
Act, puts people in charge of their own health care. It encourages 
competition to lower costs and expand coverage.
  American families, businesses, and individuals deserve real solutions 
to the very serious problems that exist in health care in America 
today. The American Health Care Reform Act provides a path to true 
reform.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

            STOP THE OBSTRUCTION AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the healthcare.gov Web site glitches are 
truly unacceptable, and they must be fixed as quickly as possible.
  However, the majority party is not talking about fixing the Web site. 
They are fixated on criticizing the Affordable Care Act instead of 
helping the American public understand the act and receive the benefits 
of true affordable care.
  Countless hours in committees, over 40 votes to repeal and delay, and 
millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on delaying, defunding and 
undermining this law. Throwing sticks into the spokes of the law will 
not help to make it better. I urge my colleagues to stop the 
obstruction and to be part of the solution.

[Pages S2041-S2042]
                              HEALTH CARE

  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the subject 
our Nation is focused on as the Supreme Court takes up some of the 
constitutional provisions of the health care law that was passed a 
couple of years ago in this body.
  Obviously, the courts will decide whether the law that was passed is 
constitutional. There are a number of challenges. That will take place 
by the end of June, according to what we hear.
  Secondly, there is an election process underway where the candidates 
running for the Republican nomination have talked about the things they 
will do in the event they are elected as it relates to the health care 
bill.
  I want to talk about the fact that regardless of the Supreme Court 
and regardless of what may happen in the electoral process, I have yet 
to meet a person on either side of the aisle--and maybe today will be 
the first time--who believes this bill can work as it was passed. What 
that leads me to say is that regardless of what happens, I think most 
of us are aware that the financial data that was used to put together 
this bill is flawed, and the fact that it is flawed, it will not work 
over the longer haul.
  For the same reasons I railed against the highway bill for breaking 
the Budget Control Act we just put in place last August, I voted 
against this bill--the fact that we used 10 years' worth of revenues 
and 6 years' worth of costs, which greatly exacerbates the problem in 
the outyears; the fact that we took $529 billion in savings from 
Medicare to create this problem and yet left behind the issue we deal 
with in this body almost every year and a half, which is the 
sustainable growth rate that we deal with with physicians; and then, 
thirdly, the fact that we placed an unfunded mandate on States.
  The State of Tennessee has actually been highly progressive as it 
relates to health care. In the State of Tennessee, dealing with 
citizens who are in need, we created a program called TennCare. It went 
through lots of problems but over the last several years has been 
functioning in a stable way. But what this bill did was mandate to the 
State of Tennessee that in order to keep the Medicaid funding that 
funds TennCare, the State has to, on its own accord, match Federal 
grants with over $1.1 billion in costs. So from 2014 to 2019, what this 
bill does is mandate that the State of Tennessee use $1.1 billion of 
its own resources to expand the Medicaid Program to meet the needs this 
bill has put in place.
  This is the point of my being on the floor here today. Again, I do 
not know of anybody here who believes this bill will cost only what was 
laid out as we debated. As a matter of fact, we have had so many 
people--the McKenzie Group and others--who have laid out how many 
private companies in our country will basically get rid of their health 
care and put people out on the public exchange. And the cost of that is 
going to be tremendous.
  Our own former Governor, a Democrat, who has spent a lot of his 
lifetime in health care on health care issues, projected that the State 
of Tennessee, if it decided that it wanted to put its own employees out 
on the public exchange, could save $160 million--by putting its 
employees away from its own health care plan and out on the exchanges. 
Obviously, I doubt that is something States are going to do. But his 
point is this: In a free market system, people are going to respond 
based on what is best for their company and what is best for their 
employees.
  If you look at the subsidy levels that this bill lays out--up to 400 
percent of poverty--they are massive subsidies. We are talking about 
people who are earning over $78,000 a year. So when you look at the 
subsidies this bill has put in place, what employers are going to 
quickly find, especially because we put a subsidy in place on the one 
hand and on the other hand, because this bill lays out the type of 
coverage companies have to have in place--there are attributes that 
cause those costs to rise, and we have already seen that happening 
throughout our private sector; I think that is undeniable--what is 
going to happen is the companies are going to say: We would be better 
off paying the $2,000 penalty. Our employees get these massive 
subsidies, by the way, that are paid for by all taxpayers in America.
  What that means is that there are going to be far more people on 
these public exchanges than ever were anticipated when this bill was 
being put in place.
  My point is that the bill, when it was being constructed, used 10 
years' worth of revenues and 6 years' worth of cost, and that made it 
neutral. Anybody can see that in the outyears that is obviously going 
to create a tremendous

[[Page S2042]]

problem, a fiscal problem for this government, for our country. But the 
problem is that when it was laid out, the amount of people who were 
then thought would go on the plan was much lower than is actually going 
to be the case.
  Again, I think what you are going to see throughout our Nation, if 
this bill stays in place as it is, is a massive exodus by private 
employers from the health care business. What that is going to do is 
put them on these public exchanges with the subsidies, and, in fact, 
what it is going to do is drive up the cost even more than people ever 
anticipated.
  So this is my point. There is going to be a Supreme Court judgment 
this June. None of us knows what it is going to be. We have pundits on 
the left who say they are confident the bill is going to stay in 
place. We have pundits on the right who say they are confident, 
constitutionally, it is going to be overturned. We will have an 
election in November that may change the course of history as it 
relates to this bill.

  Even if those two events have no effect on this bill, I wish to come 
back to my base premise, which is that there is no possible way this 
bill is going to work as it was laid out during the debate. There is no 
way the projections that were laid out as to what the cost of this bill 
is going to be are going to be what the actual costs are.
  What I say is, regardless, this body is going to be pressed with 
replacing this legislation with something that makes common sense. 
There was actually a lot of bipartisanship, prior to us passing this 
piece of legislation, about what those commonsense measures should be. 
We ended up instead with something that was far more sweeping, 
something most Americans find offensive, something that, no question, 
will cause this Nation tremendous fiscal distress.
  My point is, yes, we are going to be watching this June as the 
Supreme Court rules. Yes, we are going to pay attention to the 
elections in November. Regardless of those outcomes, it is my belief 
this body will have to come together and put into place a different 
piece of health care legislation that actually fits the times and the 
American people and allows the freedom of choice the people are 
accustomed to and is built on premises that will cause our country to 
be fiscally sound. I stand ready to work with people on both sides of 
the aisle when that time comes to make that happen.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is 
recognized.
  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the harsh realities of the health care 
reform law are coming home to roost.
  My State is bracing for the impact of the so-called affordable care 
act.
  Under the health care reform law, enrollment under an expanded 
Medicaid Program is projected to increase in my State of Mississippi by 
as much as 44 percent in 2014. Thousands of people will be forced onto 
the Medicaid rolls. The legislature in my state is wrestling with 
serious budget pressures from the cost of the Medicaid Program.
  Mississippi has the highest Federal matching assistance percentage in 
the country at approximately 75 percent. But over the course of the 
next 10 years, our State match requirement will increase by $127 
million each year for a total of $1.3 billion by the year 2020. Our 
State's budget can't handle that burden. Other States are facing 
similar constraints.
  The affordable care act is essentially taking aim at State 
governments. The maintenance-of-effort requirements for the Medicaid 
Program are particularly restrictive. They inhibit a State's ability to 
spend taxpayer money wisely, and they ignore the inherent problems 
within the Medicaid Program. Mississippi faces the prospect of 
expending all of its resources keeping up with an unfunded mandate that 
increases its dependency on the Federal Government, while being forced 
to cut other important services, such as education.
  In addition, physician services cannot keep up with the demands of an 
expanded Medicaid population. This law does nothing to address the 
decreasing physician participation rates and quality-of-care issues 
that are rampant in the Medicaid Program.
  Another charge to States in these difficult fiscal times is the 
creation of health insurance exchanges. My State's efforts to develop 
an exchange began well before the affordable care act was enacted, and 
the State is on track to set up a health insurance exchange by the 
January 2014 deadline. We are committed to creating an exchange that 
can serve Mississippians well, but the state needs flexibility in order 
to do that. The Mississippi Department of Insurance is working to avoid 
defaulting to a federally-run exchange, but bureaucratic red tape 
threatens to hinder their progress. I am concerned that the deadlines 
put forth in the affordable care act are unrealistic due to the amount 
of time and resources that are required for such a large project.
  These are just a few of the problems the affordable care act poses 
for my State and others as well. It is proving to be an increasingly 
expensive statute that is making health care more costly for 
individuals, businesses, and State governments. It is my hope that 
relief can be found at the Supreme Court to avoid the potentially 
devastating impact of this law.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in 
morning business for up to, or perhaps 1 or 2 minutes over, 20 minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          GOVERNMENT GLITCHES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the American people have 
become all too accustomed to government glitches, which result largely 
from government that has grown too large, too bureaucratic, and too 
difficult to navigate.
  Every day, with a dedicated and compassionate staff, I assist 
constituents in navigating the frustrating and challenging bureaucracy 
of the Federal Government. On a daily basis, we attempt to problem-
solve issues that citizens face when seeking resolution on issues with 
Federal agencies, agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, Veterans Affairs, or FEMA, just to 
name a few.
  The frustrations and difficulties created as unintended consequences 
of the Affordable Care Act have dramatically expanded how large and 
damaging government glitches can be. The Web site glitches are just 
icing on the cake; for over the last several years, the broken promises 
have continued to mount. One of the more glaring broken promises was 
reported yesterday when Americans found out they won't be able to keep 
the plan they have, despite what the President has been telling us.
  Yesterday, NBC News aired a report that sources involved in the 
Affordable Care Act have admitted that:

       Fifty to 75 percent of the 14 million consumers who buy 
     their insurance individually can expect to receive a 
     ``cancelation'' letter or the equivalent over the next year 
     because their existing policies don't meet the standards 
     mandated by the new health care law.

  One expert was reported as predicting that number could reach as high 
as 80 percent. All of the four NBC sources said that many of those 
forced to buy pricier new policies will experience ``sticker shock.''
  While millions of Americans are being shocked by cancelation letters 
for their health insurance, the Obama administration has known of this 
government glitch for at least 3 years.
  Mr. Speaker, the so-called Affordable Care Act has been anything but 
affordable. Prices continue to rise on insurance premiums, and the cost 
of care nationally continues to go up.
  Mr. Speaker, this law was intended to expand access and quality. Yet 
in Pennsylvania, children are being forced out of the Children's Health 
Insurance Program, commonly known as PA CHIP, and into medical 
assistance. CHIP is serving our kids adequately through commercial 
products that are widely accepted by physicians. It is low-cost, 
market-based health insurance coverage. Moving these kids onto Medicaid 
has the potential to dramatically limit access to care.
  Given the mounting evidence of glitches in ObamaCare's rollout, 
affordability, and individual choice, you have to wonder about what the 
future holds. From the missed deadlines, delays, and special waivers 
to, now, Web site crashes and Americans losing the plans they have, the 
outcomes we are encountering with this law are completely unacceptable.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the administration to delay and fix all 
these glitches that are so evident in the Affordable Care Act. It is 
time for the Obama administration to do the right thing. The American 
people deserve as much.

                           Amendment No. 2708

  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my 
amendment No. 2708 and ask for its consideration.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The clerk will report.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Gillibrand] proposes an 
     amendment numbered 2708.

  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
reading of the amendment be dispensed with.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The amendment is as follows:

    (Purpose: To require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to issue guidelines for methods, other than building 
   elevation, that owners of certain urban residential buildings may 
               implement to mitigate against flood risk)

       At the end of title I, add the following:

     SEC. 1__. FLOOD MITIGATION METHODS FOR URBAN BUILDINGS.

       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall issue 
     guidelines for property owners that--
       (1) provide alternative methods of mitigation, other than 
     building elevation, to reduce flood risk to urban residential 
     buildings that cannot be elevated due to their structural 
     characteristics, including--
       (A) types of building materials; and
       (B) types of floodproofing; and
       (2) inform property owners about how the implementation of 
     mitigation methods described in paragraph (1) may affect risk 
     premium rates for flood insurance coverage under the National 
     Flood Insurance Program.
       (b) Calculation of Risk Premium Rates.--In calculating the 
     risk premium rate charged for flood insurance for a property 
     under section 1308 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 
     1968 (42 U.S.C. 4015), the Administrator shall take into 
     account the implementation of any mitigation method 
     identified by the Administrator in the guidance issued under 
     subsection (a) of this section.

  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I first wish to thank Senator 
Menendez, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Isakson for their tremendous 
leadership on the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, of which 
I am a very proud cosponsor, and for working with me and my staff on an 
amendment that is so critical to so many New Yorkers who are still 
recovering from Superstorm Sandy.
  My amendment is quite simple and common sense. It is aimed to help 
homeowners who are currently stuck in a bureaucratic ditch that is 
impossible for them to climb out of due to the immovable reality of the 
buildings in which they live.
  Under today's FEMA policy, flood insurance premium rates are based on 
the elevation of the house relative to the base flood elevation, which 
is the elevation that FEMA calculates that floodwaters have a 1-percent 
chance of rising to in any given year.
  Under normal circumstances, homes can be elevated to avoid high 
insurance rates that are assessed on homes that are built below the 
base flood elevation in special flood hazard areas, but in places such 
as New York and New Jersey this is impossible for owners of older urban 
homes, such as brownstones, row houses, and multifamily buildings, 
which can predate the Civil War, which in many instances cannot be 
raised due to structural characteristics and were built before flood 
maps were in place.
  When their homes are mapped in a flood zone, they are simply left 
without any option to lower their flood insurance premiums, which can 
be as high as tens of thousands of dollars each year. To fix this, my 
amendment would require FEMA to provide a uniform set of guidance that 
provides FEMA-approved methods of mitigation for homeowners who simply 
cannot elevate their homes. This amendment would require FEMA to look 
at whether a homeowner has implemented any of the prescribed 
alternatives and take that into consideration when calculating a home's 
flood insurance risk premium. By providing a clear set of mitigation 
alternatives to these homeowners, this amendment will help New Yorkers 
and homeowners across the country who cannot elevate their homes to 
reduce their flood risk. It will help homeowners prevent costly damage 
to their homes during the next storm or flood and save money and 
potential disaster recovery costs in the long term.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll
  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the flood 
insurance fix bill on the floor today. I urge my colleagues on a 
bipartisan basis to come together and pass this first crucial step 
toward getting it right with the National Flood Insurance Program. It 
is important for America. It is important for millions upon millions of 
American homeowners, not just in Louisiana, not just in Florida, but in 
every State. Every State in the country is absolutely affected.
  I also specifically urge my colleagues to defeat the Toomey 
amendment, which I think is very well intended but will not get the job 
done, and to waive the budget point of order, which is a largely 
technical point of order. I will explain each of those in turn.
  First of all, I will explain the need for this bill to get things 
right. All of us came together over a year ago and passed the so-called 
Biggert-Waters Act, to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program 
and to reform it in important ways. We needed to do that broad-brush. 
The program needed to be continued, and not just in short-term fits and 
starts, which had been the pattern for many years. In fact, in 2010 it 
was so bad that we actually let the program lapse four different times 
by inaction, shutting down thousands upon thousands of real estate 
closings that we needed to build our economy, shutting those down every 
time. So we needed that reauthorization. We needed and still need 
reforms of the program. We need to build up the program to make it 
fiscally sustainable, to make sure that over time we get revenues, 
premiums coming in that cover the full cost of the program. There is no 
debate about that. That is why we passed that bill.
  What was not foreseen was that in some significant number of cases, 
those reforms, once they were put into effect, would actually lead to 
completely unaffordable rate increases--a completely unsustainable path 
forward that would not even get us toward the goal of building up the 
fund and building up the program to make it fiscally sustainable. No 
expert predicted that beforehand. No one from FEMA said:

[[Page S567]]

You will have some rates that are completely unaffordable. No outside 
insurance experts said that. But once the details of the 
reauthorization began to be put in place, that became very apparent. We 
do not know exactly how many cases we would have like this, but we know 
they are not just isolated cases. We know they are not just in coastal 
communities. They are in every State, to some extent or another, around 
the country. Over time, Members of both parties from every State have 
begun to understand that, which brings us together hopefully in a 
constructive way on the floor today.
  Certainly, that situation is dire and the threat is very real in 
Louisiana. Months ago, for instance, I visited a neighborhood in St. 
Charles Parish, which is part of southeast Louisiana, right on the 
Mississippi River. I visited a very nice, solid middle-class 
neighborhood. I met with many homeowners there. They presented me with 
a box--a box this big, at least--full of keys, house keys. They were 
these folks' actual house keys. They were saying: If this is not fixed, 
if this is not done right in time, we are going to have to turn these 
keys in to the banks, to the government, to whomever, because we would 
face not only premium increases. We had all accepted premium increases 
as part of the reform and as part of the reauthorization, but these 
would be completely unaffordable, unsustainable increases--literally 
going to $12,000, $18,000 or $27,000 a year--not on a millionaire's 
home but on a modest middle-class home. That just doesn't work.

  These folks were saying very sincerely, very directly: Here are my 
home keys because that is where this is headed.
  That is not right on so many different levels. First and foremost, it 
is not right for those Americans who have lived by the rules every step 
of the way, who built to the right elevation when they built their 
home, who got the flood insurance required by law, required by 
prudence, and paid all of their premiums. They went through mitigation 
programs, if they could, to raise their homes in many cases.
  These are folks who are not living right on the coast, who are not 
choosing highly dangerous areas, and who do not have second homes, 
beach homes. We are not talking about that at all. We are talking about 
a solid middle-class neighborhood way off the gulf coast.
  These are people who followed the rules every step of the way who 
still failed the prospect of those completely unaffordable increases. 
That is not right, and it is not fair.
  On a second level, that reality threatens whole communities and it 
threatens our economy because if that were allowed to happen in any 
significant number of cases, it would be an economic spiral downward. 
Banks would be burdened with foreclosures. Local businesses would be 
hurt significantly. Whole communities would be in an economic spiral 
downward.
  We are not just talking about second homes on a beach. We are not 
talking about that at all in Louisiana. This bill does not give any 
relief regarding second homes, for instance. We are talking about a lot 
of communities and a real and unsustainable hit to our economy.
  On a third and final level, that reality would ensure we don't even 
get to the goal of these reforms, which is to make the system whole and 
fiscally sustainable. To do that we need more folks in the National 
Flood Insurance Program, not folks leaving and turning in their keys. 
That will kill any effort to make the program solid fiscally and 
sustainable fiscally. So on every level we cannot allow this to happen.
  The Menendez-Isakson bill, with the help of many other Members, 
including myself, was put together to get us to the right place. It 
takes the important first step to make sure we get it right, FEMA does 
the mapping correctly--which they are not doing in some cases now--and 
FEMA does the affordability study mandated in the original Biggert-
Waters, but which FEMA has not even begun yet. We do all those things 
to get this right and avoid completely unaffordable rate increases.
  I urge my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to support this good bill.
  We also need your support in defeating the Toomey amendment and in 
waiving the budget point of order. Let me speak about those briefly.
  Senator Toomey's amendment is very well intended, but it falls short, 
in my opinion. It limits any delay in rate increases to 2 years, and 
some rate increases continue for those 2 years. Most importantly, it 
doesn't mandate and ensure that FEMA ever gets through this 
affordability study, ever makes recommendations to Congress for the 
ultimate fix, and doesn't give us any time to react and legislate in 
that area. It doesn't ensure in any way that FEMA gets its mapping 
right based on true sound science and engineering methodologies.
  That is just kicking the can down the road and not ensuring in any 
meaningful way that we are going to get it right. That simply isn't 
good enough.
  We need to tie in any delay to figuring out the ultimate fix by 
having FEMA complete its affordability study, by making FEMA make 
recommendations to us, by giving us 6 months to act on those 
recommendations, by mandating that FEMA do its mapping correctly and 
not have rate increases before it rushes forward with incorrect 
mapping, which is going on right now in some cases.
  That is what the underlying bill does. That is what the Toomey 
amendment does not do--as well intended as it is.
  Secondly, there will be a budget point-of-order vote, and we do need 
60 votes to waive that budget point of order. I will vote ``yes'' to 
waive it--as a strong fiscal conservative--because this is necessary to 
get this national flood insurance system right and to make it fiscally 
sustainable.
  In fact, over the 10-year budget window that we normally use in 
scoring, this bill has no score over those 10 years. It only has some 
scores in some intermediate periods of time, which gives rise to the 
budget point of order.
  I urge my colleagues to vote to waive that point of order, knowing 
there is no score over 10 years and also knowing that, quite frankly, 
the fiscal assumptions about the current law are enormously flawed. The 
notion that we are going to make the National Flood Insurance Program 
more stable and more fiscally sustainable by having a bunch of premiums 
go up to $27,000 a year on a modest middle-class home is crazy. That is 
not going to get us to a better place. That is going to get to us a 
worse place. That is going to shrink the program and have people leave 
the program--paying no premiums, not paying higher premiums.
  Yet raising insurance premiums has to be part of the solution, but 
unaffordable premium increases aren't part of the solution because 
people can't afford to pay them. So they will pay zero instead of 
something substantial. They will leave the program instead of putting 
more homeowners and properties in the program, which is essential to 
get to a strong and stable fiscal situation.
  Again, on a bipartisan basis, I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill--it is a very important step to stabilize and fix the situation--
to defeat the Toomey amendment and to waive the budget point of order, 
which is absolutely necessary in this process to support a good bill.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his input into 
the legislation, his work, and his advocacy. I agree with him on the 
other underlying statements that he made, particularly as it relates to 
the necessity for the legislation, as well as the opposition to the 
Toomey amendment.
  I understand what Senator Toomey is trying to do, but I agree it 
doesn't meet the ultimate challenge. I agree as well on the budget 
point of order for the reason Senator Vitter says.
  I thank the Senator for his support.
  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time 
that takes place during any subsequent quorum calls--or the subsequent 
quorum call that I am going to ask

[[Page S568]]

for--be equally divided on the Gillibrand amendment.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                      Tribute to Hadiya Pendleton

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Hadiya 
Pendleton, lost to gunfire 1 year ago today, January 29, 2013. She was 
15 years old. She was gunned down while she was standing with friends 
at a park in Chicago's South Side.
  She was a very talented, caring girl with a bright future. She was a 
sophomore at King College Prep, an honor student, and a majorette in 
the school band. This is her photograph. Those who knew her talk about 
her warm heart, her big smile, and what a great friend she was to all 
of those around her.
  A week before her death, Hadiya was in Washington, DC, performing 
with her school band for President Barack Obama's inaugural 
celebration. She was absolutely thrilled that as a high school student 
she could come out and perform for the President she loved.
  Days afterwards she was gunned down, murdered by men who allegedly 
mistook Hadiya and her friends for members of a rival street gang. I 
join with those in Chicago and across America who mourn this grim 
anniversary and I extend my condolences to her family.

  This last week or two--even longer now--it has been pretty cold in 
Chicago, bitter cold: snow, ice, with people not going outside much. 
But I wanted to make a trip Saturday morning to visit Hadiya's mom and 
dad on the occasion of this sad anniversary. Her mom Cleo, her father 
Nate, and her 11-year-old brother Nate, Jr., as well as the extended 
family, are mourning her loss.
  We sat in their apartment Saturday morning and talked a little about 
her. We talked about what it meant, what the reaction had been. The 
parents were heartened that King College Prep had not forgotten their 
daughter, that today they were having a special observance and ceremony 
to remember her. It meant a lot to her mom and dad.
  They have been here before my judiciary subcommittee when we 
discussed issues involving gun violence. They have been on television. 
They have made the rounds. But when you are there with them in their 
apartment, you know that after the cameras are gone and all the 
visitors are gone, it is still a sad remembrance of a beautiful young 
girl whose life was cut short.
  No family should have to experience what they went through, but like 
so many families who have lost loved ones to sudden violence, the 
Pendletons have decided to dedicate themselves to turning their pain 
into purpose. They are working to reduce the scourge of gun violence so 
that other families can be spared. They have established the Hadiya 
Pendleton Foundation in Chicago to create a safe space for city youth 
and provide afterschool enrichment programs to help kids avoid the 
violence on the streets.
  Incidentally, Hadiya was once featured in a public service 
announcement video where she said: It is your job as students to say no 
to gangs and yes to a great future. The foundation named after her will 
help other students reach that goal. I commend the family for their 
work on this foundation. I believe it will make a difference.
  Hadiya's family, as I mentioned, traveled to Washington to talk about 
our laws and how to change them to avoid future violence. In 
particular, they have spoken out about the need to crack down on the 
gun supply to gang members. The current Federal laws on what we call 
straw purchasing and gun trafficking are an embarrassment. They are too 
weak. They need to be strengthened. I have joined with my colleague 
Senator Ma.."

                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 2575

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I understand that H.R. 2575 has been 
received from the House and is at the desk. I would ask for its first 
reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 2575) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to repeal the 30-hour threshold for classification as a 
     full-time employee for purposes of the employer mandate in 
     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and replace it 
     with 40 hours.

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I would ask for a second reading and 
object to my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection having been heard, the bill will 
receive its second reading on the next legislative day.

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, when the time comes, Members and staff will 
get their insurance at dchealthlink.com. They will have a good chance 
to pay less because they will have 267 choices.
  In advance, one of my staff members, who has a name-brand policy from 
our Federal program, went on dchealthlink
.com and found that she could get a comparable policy for at least $100 
less with no deductible.
  If Republicans want to deal in anecdotes, hers is far more typical 
than those from the crowd who have gone from 41 repeals to their new 
strategy of actively sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.
